            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE nobility and dignity of Chirurgery are too well known to want the help of an Oratour to ſet them forth. If a Panegyrick were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, it were beſt made by running through the Particulars of the Art, and the Hiſtory of the Diſeaſes cured thereby. He that ſhall duly conſider the deplorable miſery of mankind, and how much it wanteth relief in ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Inſtances, muſt needs acknowledge us to be what Antiquity hath long ſince call'd us, viz. <hi>The Hands of God.</hi> Indeed the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> in the days of Ignorance and Idolatry did not ſtick to teſtifie their reverence of the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men of the Profeſſion, by referring them into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gods which they worſhipt. Nor have the latter times, though wiſer then to riſe to ſuch extravagancy, been backward in expreſſing their eſteem of us; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have guided with more diſcretion and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In ſtead of ſuch Deification and fabulous Stories, they have rewarded us with Honour, Wealth, and Collegiate Foundations both in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities and great Cities. Among which ſort our own Society in the City of <hi>London,</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Kings, and frequently encouraged by freſh Grants from them, ought to have an honourable mention; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of which have contributed ſo much to the improvement
<pb facs="tcp:95669:5"/>of the Faculty, and to the honour of the Nation. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiall part hath been ſignally promoted in it, ſo as to render it famous all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and every year to invite Forreiners to attend our Lectures from beyond the ſeas. It had like to have done as great things in the Inſtitutionary part of Chirurgery, had the learned Lectures of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chirurgeon Doctor <hi>Read</hi> been continued by a ſucceſſion of ſuch Profeſſours. It being reaſonable to imagine, that the Curioſity and Induſtry that hath been ſo eminent in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Anatomicall part, would have been the like in that alſo. Since it hath been our unhappineſs to have that neglected, I hope it will not be ill taken if we that are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it do ſupply this defect by our own private Labours. This hath been already done by Mr. <hi>Clowes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodall,</hi> and ſome others, whoſe laudable Example I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to follow, and to put my own Papers in print; that what was at firſt intended for my private ſatisfaction, may be uſefull to others as well as to my ſelf. In doing this, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I have made a vertue of neceſſity, and imployed thoſe hours for the publick ſervice, which a frequently-repeated Sickneſs hath for this twenty years laſt paſt deny'd me the uſe of in my private occaſions. It hath pleaſed God by caſting me into ſuch a condition to give me opportunity of reading and thinking, as well as practiſing. Both which are neceſſary to the accompliſhment not onely of an Authour, but indeed of a Chirurgeon. I cannot be ſo uncharitable to my Brethren, as to wiſh them the like Sickneſs to oblige them to the like Retirements for contemplation and ſtudy. But I do heartily wiſh, that what was neceſſity in me may be choice in them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would ſet apart ſome time for reflexion upon their Labours, and for comparing the Empiricall part of the Prefeſſion with the Rationall. They will ſoon find how many Gaps do ſtill lie open in this goodly Fabrick, and how much is wanting to make the Building compleat. What defects do remain even in the Hiſtory of Diſeaſes themſelves, and the plain practicall things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:95669:5"/>in every expert Chirurgeon can correct the Authours he reads? This well conſidered cannot but ſpur him on to adde his Obſervations to the bulk of what hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore heaped up for this purpoſe, and to contribute his endeavours to the finiſhing of what hath been begun, and thus far carried on, by other hands. As to my own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, Reader, I muſt tell thee, that what I have chiefly aimed at in this Book hath been, perſpicuity and conciſeneſs in the Inſtitutionary part of the ſame, and aptneſs in the annexed Obſervations; that ſo the whole may be made eaſy to the young Chirurgeon, and as inſtructive as may be. In all which I doubt not but the farther he goeth on in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the more of clearneſs and plainneſs he will find; and the whole ſo much better performed then a meer Academick could have done it, without being a Practitioner himſelf, as a Traveller can deſcribe a Country to one that is taking a journey into it more ſenſibly and uſefully, then one that hath onely read of it and ſeen it in Maps.</p>
            <p>Know, Reader, that as to theſe Treatiſes, though in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to them I have read all the eminent Chirurgicall Authours, yet in the writing of them I was more conformed to my own judgment and experience, then other mens authority. This will conſequently make them liable to the Cenſure of many ſorts of men. Such ancient Practitioners as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be now learning a new Leſſon, will be angry that thoſe Definitions and Deſcriptions, and ſometimes Methods of Cure, are receded from, which they learned when young; thoſe being the <hi>baſis</hi> on which they have built the whole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of their Practice. I deſire ſuch men to content themſelves with neglecting them; they being not written for their uſe, but for younger men, who have their Principles and Maximes of Chirurgery yet to chuſe. Others, wholly taken up with the Novelties wherewith this Age aboundeth, will be angry that all the new Notions are not here purſued to nicety, and many little both Anatomicall and Chymicall Punctilio's inſerted and brought in on all occaſions, in ſtead
<pb facs="tcp:95669:6"/>of the old way of expreſſing the Accidents of Diſeaſes, with their Cauſes and Cure. I would have theſe men conſider, that I am a Practiſer, not an Academick: that I delight in thoſe things as far as they are uſefull to life, but thought it too great a digreſſion from my preſent purpoſe to ſtuff up a practicall Book with ſuch Philoſophicall Curioſities, which become it juſt as well, as it would become a Divine to fill a practicall Diſcourſe with School-diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>However, I reſolving not to truſt my ſelf wholly with a caſe of this nice difficulty, did chuſe a Friend to whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I did permit the whole, I mean the Learned Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> of the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> who, upon peruſall of my Papers, was pleaſed to approve of my intention, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to alter what he thought fit in them, and alway to cut off the Theory, when it adventured upon Controverſiall Diſcourſes; ſtill urging, that this was not intended for a Book of Controverſie, but of plain Inſtitution; not to make men ſubtill Diſputants, but good Practiſers. I do confeſs he did gratifie my humour in it, whoſe inclinations lie wholly that way: But withall I made bold ſometimes to pleaſe my own fanſy, in not alway following his advice, or obeying the Corrections he made. His pardon I eaſily got for ſo doing, he not affecting a Tyranny in Friendſhip: and I hope I ſhall thine, (Reader,) if among many things that are here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, thou findeſt ſome not altogether to thy palate. Let what thou doſt find acceptable to thee in this Treatiſe excuſe the impertinence of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thou art farther to be informed, that the writing of ſo large a Volume as thou now art preſented with is but a late deſign, to which ſeverall of the particular Tracts, ſome of which were publiſht four years ſince, others written about that time, did encourage me. One attempt drew on another, till at length it grew to the bulk thou ſeeſt. Which I do alleage in excuſe of the Method of this Book; which, if it had been all written at once, might have been contrived all into a piece. But the leſſer Treatiſes being written before the
<pb facs="tcp:95669:6"/>greater, I was not willing to diſmember them again, or to write new Diſcourſes on thoſe Subjects which I had already handled fully. The young Chirurgeon will reap benefit by it, finding ſome of the moſt troubleſome Diſeaſes in Chirurgery treated of wholly under one view, which otherwiſe he muſt have found piecemeal delivered in ſeverall places. This Apologie I chiefly made for the Treatiſe of the <hi>King's Evill,</hi> where many Diſeaſes are diſcourſed of which other Writers handle in other places of Chirurgery. It is ſufficient to ſay, that I think moſt inſtances of thoſe Diſeaſes to partake at leaſt of that Malady, if not entirely to be that: and therefore when I wrote the particular Treatiſe, it was fit to handle them there; and that being done, I ſaw no reaſon for taking them out again, to ſupply other parts of the Book.</p>
            <p>After all things are conſidered and weighed in this and other Chirurgicall Diſcourſes that are publick, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our ſucceſs in Practice, we ſhall ſoon find cauſe of lamenting our own weakneſs and inability in the carrying on of ſo great a work, as the recovery of Mankind out of thoſe many Diſtempers to which various Misfortunes, and many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſucceſſions of Intemperance, and other Accidents both without and within, have betrayed us for ſo many ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When the young Chirurgeon ſhall find the Cure eaſie in the Theory, and appear ſo at firſt in the Practice too, yet ſuddenly deceive him with a Relapſe, and not onely once, but often, delude his beſt endeavours: when the By-ſtanders and perſons concerned ſhall begin to accuſe him of Knavery in his proceeding, and think him to pull back a Cure, whilſt he is onely rolling <hi>Siſyphus</hi> his Stone, which will tumble down whether he will or not: He will then wiſh, that all other Practiſers had done what I have in this Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their Obſervations, both ſucceſsfull and unſucceſsfull, thereby increaſing knowledg in our Profeſſion, and leaving Sea-marks for the diſcovery of ſuch Rocks as they themſelves have ſplit upon before. For my part, I have done it faithfully, and thought it no diſgrace to let the world ſee where I failed
<pb facs="tcp:95669:7"/>of ſucceſs, that thoſe that come after me may learn what to avoid: there being more of inſtructiveneſs often in an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate caſe then in a fortunate one; and more ingenuity in confeſſing ſuch misfortunes which are incident to mankind, and which have attended all my Brethren as well as my ſelf, and will attend thee alſo, Reader, in ſpight of all thy care and diligence, if thou undertake the imployment. Thou wilt alſo learn one neceſſary piece of Humility, <hi>viz.</hi> not to truſt too much on thy own judgment, eſpecially in difficult caſes; but to think fit to ſeek the advice of other Phyſicians or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, whoſe long experience hath enabled them to aſſiſt thee in preventing the Accidents, and encourage thee to go on in the work, or forewarn thee of the danger.

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Tumours in generall.</head>
                     <p>WHat a <hi>Tumour</hi> is (when we underſtand a Diſeaſe by the word) is ſo ſufficiently explained by <hi>Galen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Definition.</note> that I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with any farther diſquiſition about it. It is by him defined, <hi>A Diſeaſe in which the parts of the body recede from their natural ſtate by an undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their bigneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now by what Names the Ancients did expreſs a Tumour in generall, many of which were afterwards appropriated to the particular Species of it, as <hi>Oedema, Apoſtema, Phyma,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall leave to the Criticks and men of leiſure to enquire: it ſhall ſuffice me, that my Definition tells you what I mean.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Tumours are variouſly delivered by ſundry Authours,<note place="margin">Cauſe of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</note> with a larger repetition of which I ſhall not here trouble you. What my own thoughts ſuggeſt to me out of them upon this ſubject is this in ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> that they muſt be conſidered either with regard to their Time and Place, or to the Matter of which they conſiſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In regard to their Time and Place we call them, 1. Antecedent, 2. Conjunct.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By an <hi>Antecedent</hi> Cauſe I mean that which yet hath not actually produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Tumour, but is throughly mixed with the Bloud,<note place="margin">Antecedent.</note> or otherwiſe lodged in ſome convenient place where it is not troubleſome to nature, at leaſt not to this Part; though it have a great inclination to be ſo, and, if not prevented, doth produce the feared effect. Of this ſort I reckon all Impurities in the Bloud which do not yet ſtart out into the ſolid parts: as the Matter of an <hi>Eryſipelas, Phlegmon, Parotis, Bubo,</hi> &amp;c. before a Criſis is made; ſo alſo any Tumour in the body, which, lying in any part of it, is apt to be tranſlated to another. This, though it may be the conjunct cauſe of the Tumour of the part where it is now lodged, is the antecedent cauſe of that Tumour which it raiſeth in another place, to which it may be after derived, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By a <hi>Conjunct</hi> Cauſe I mean the very Matter of the Tumour that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impacted into the part, by others called the <hi>cauſa continens:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conjunct.</note> upon the encreaſe of which the Tumour encreaſeth; on the diminution of it it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. In regard of the Matter of which they are made, we do uſually attribute their Original to, 1. Humour, 2. Wind, 3. the Interpoſition of a ſolid Body.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95669:10"/>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Humour: by Fluxion;</note> 
                        <hi>Humour</hi> produceth Tumour by, 1. Fluxion, 2. Congeſtion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Fluxion</hi> is the ſudden motion of Humours in the body to any part, and commonly depends upon one or more of theſe following cauſes: 1. the part tranſmitting; 2. the part recipient; 3. the condition of the Humour.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The part <hi>tranſmitting</hi> doth cauſe ſudden Fluxion, when, being it ſelf ſtrong, it is provoked by the heat, ſharpneſs, quantity, or other fault of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and, being ſo provoked, tranſlates it to ſome weaker part, whether externall, or internall. This is moſt evident in the Criſis of Fevers, from which the Humour is often diſcharged inwardly by the way of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> upon the inward <hi>viſcera;</hi> or outwardly in the form of an <hi>Eryſipelas, Bubo, Parotis, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunculus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The part <hi>recipient</hi> is the Cauſe of Tumours either, 1. paſſively, or, 2. actively.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Paſſively,</hi> when it receives Humours, and cannot expell them: whether it be through its weakneſs, laxity of Pores, over-wideneſſe of Veſſels, as in a <hi>Varix;</hi> or their too great ſtreightneſs or obſtruction, its poſition in a declining part, or its being diſabled by externall accidents, as Bruiſe, Fall, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Actively,</hi> when it attracts Humours to it ſelf: either, 1. through heat, whether created by Humours already flowed, or by hot Medicines, bliſtering Plaiſters, the Sun, Fire, Cupping-glaſſes, &amp;c. or, 2. pain from corroding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, wounds, bruiſes. I know this latter Head of Attraction may be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd at by ſome, who will reduce all Attraction to Pulſion, and ſo render other reaſons of theſe accidents: But that troubles not me, who handle the notion in a practical way, leaving the ſpeculation to curious men.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The condition of the Humour</hi> is the third and, indeed, great Cauſe from which Tumours do ariſe: in the explaining of which we muſt conſider either the Plenitude of Veſſels, or the Impurity of the Humours themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Plenitude of Veſſels,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Plethora,</hi> when it happens, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an Extravaſation of bloud, either by Ruption or Apertion of them: either of which, if they fall inwardly upon the Brain or ſome noble part, are of great danger; as in <hi>Apoplexia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Impurity</hi> or <hi>Cacochymia</hi> (to which ſome will alſo reduce <hi>Plethora</hi>) is a Degeneration of the Humours into a preternatural ſtate, from which Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a multitude of Diſeaſes do ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">by Congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                        <hi>Congeſtion</hi> is then ſaid to be the Cauſe of a Tumour, when the growth of it is ſlow and without pain, it commonly owing its original to a fault of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in the Part, or at leaſt a weakneſs in the expulſive faculty; ſometimes alſo to the want of heat, and the denſity of the skin, which hinders perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe Tumours are generally cold, whereas thoſe made by Fluxion are moſt frequently hot. The Matter of theſe is either thin and ſerous, or thick and phlegmatick, or apt to coagulate and grow hard, as many ſcirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and <hi>Exoſtoſes,</hi> or made up of nutritious juices, as <hi>Sarcoma, Hernia car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Wind.</note> As Humour, ſo <hi>Wind</hi> begetteth Tumours: which though it ſeldome appeareth alone, but uſually mixed with ſome Humour which is the cauſe of it; yet getting predominancy it denominateth Tumours, and is called <hi>Emphyſema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Interpoſition of a ſolid Body.</note> 
                        <hi>The Interpoſition of a ſolid Body</hi> is frequently the Cauſe of a Tumour; as in the <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis, zerbalis, Exomphalos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now from the variety of theſe Cauſes ariſeth a great variety of Tumours, which do receive their ſeveral denominations from them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not trouble you with all the ſeveral diviſions and enumerations, which, according to <hi>Sennertus</hi>'s Arithmetick, make 226 in all: but I ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95669:10"/>briefly inſtance in theſe following Heads, to which the reſt may without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be reduced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Blood it ſelf is the matter of many Tumours; and that two ſeveral ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) When the <hi>ſerum</hi> is ſo extravaſated as to carry ſomething of the red or grumous part with it into the Tumour. In which caſe we find the <hi>Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and the conſequences of that, <hi>viz. Gangraena,</hi> or <hi>Sphacelus</hi> of which we have treated elſewhere: alſo <hi>Eryſipelas, Furunculus, Epinyctis, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reminthus, Phyma, Phygethlon, Bubo, Parotis, Carbunculus, Paronychia, Pernio,</hi> and <hi>Pterygion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) When the whole maſs of Blood is ſo driven into a Tumour, as that the <hi>grumus</hi> is either principally concerned, or at leaſt equally mixed with the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Examples of this are <hi>Varix, Ecchymoſis, Aneuriſma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From Choler proceedeth <hi>Herpes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. From Phlegm, <hi>Oedema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. From Melancholy, <hi>Scirrhus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. From <hi>Atra bilis, Cancer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From wateriſh Humours, <hi>Hernia aquoſa, Hydrops, Hydrocephalus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. From ſalt Humours, <hi>Scabies, Lepra,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. From Wind, <hi>Emphyſema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. From interpoſition of a ſolid body, <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have thus curſorily given you a ſummary view of the chief Heads of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which are uſually handled by our Chirurgical Writers, as a Preparatory to what I my ſelf have to ſay. And firſt we ſhall treat of Humoral Tumours in general, deſcending from thence to as many of the Particulars as will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Inſtruction of the young Artiſt.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Humoral Tumours in general.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe <hi>Tumours</hi> have been ſufficiently handled in the Firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where we have diſcourſed how Tumours from Humours are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: I ſhall here diſcourſe the <hi>Diagnoſtick, Prognoſtick,</hi> and <hi>Cure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Humoral Tumour be made by any external Cauſe, as by a Wound,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> Bruiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is eaſily diſcerned: but if there were no ſuch preceding Cauſe, you may conclude that it ariſeth from within. In this latter caſe you may judge whether a Tumour be made by Fluxion or Congeſtion thus.</p>
                     <p>That which is made by <hi>Congeſtion</hi> riſeth gradually,<note place="margin">Tumours by Congeſtion.</note> and is collected into a compact Tumour without any preceding cauſe or ſign of Fluxion, and is made with little pain, unleſs it begin in the Joynts, or parts of exquiſite Senſe. And then alſo in little Children the Tumour is ſome times made before it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſuppoſed a luxation of that Joynt, the Skin retaining its natural colour: yet as the Tumour encreaſeth, the veins are frequently ſwelled in the ſurface of it, and as the Matter makes its way outward, if ſome times inflames and becomes painful.</p>
                     <p>If the Tumour be made by <hi>Fluxion,</hi> the part is affected with pain,<note place="margin">Tumours by Fluxion.</note> and ſwelleth ſuddenly, and is accompanied with Tenſion, Pulſation, and Fever.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95669:11"/>Now when the Tumour appears either before or with the Fever, no other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe having preceded it, this is to be called <hi>Fluxion</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word. But there are two other ſorts of Tumours reducible to Fluxion, and thoſe are made by, 1. Tranſlation, 2. Attraction.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Tumours by Tranſlation.</note> The <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of an Humour, in the ſenſe I here mean it is, is that ſort of Fluzion which happens from within upon the Criſis of ſome forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſe; which though it be really Fluxion, yet it differs from that which is ſtrictly ſo called by theſe circumſtances. 1. In Tranſlation another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe preceded; in this, none at all. 2. In Fluxion, ſtrictly ſo called, the Skin is firſt affected, and by degrees the neighbouring parts; in Tranſlation it is affected laſt, the Matter working it ſelf from within outwards, inſomuch that you may find Matter in the Tumour before the Skin is much changed. 3. In Tranſlation there is often a real Extravaſation of the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the blood between the Interſtices of the Muſcles, which falleth from ſome higher place; nay, <hi>Pus</hi> it ſelf may be bred above in ſome inward Cavity, and fall down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actually formed before the Tumour begins: which is quite otherwiſe in Fluxion ſtrictly ſo called.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Tumours by Attraction.</note> The other ſort of Tumours reducible to Fluxion are thoſe that are made by <hi>Attraction:</hi> which if they do happen, ſome of the viſible Cauſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Chap. 1. did precede.</p>
                     <p>Tumours made by Fluxion have their ſeveral degrees and times,<note place="margin">Times of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours made by Fluxion.</note> as their Beginning, Augment, State, and Declination. Their Beginning is with the extenſion of the part affected: the Increaſe, when it riſeth into a conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tumour, and is then accompanied with Symptoms increaſing according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the State is when the Tumour is made, and the Symptoms at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: the Declination is when the Tumour becomes leſs, and the Symptoms abate.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> of Tumours in general are taken from the Part affected,<note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note> as it is of more excellence and uſe; alſo as it is internal, or external. By how much the more noble the Part is, by ſo much the more dangerous. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal more dangerous than external. Prognoſticks are alſo taken from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Tumour, and Accidents that attend it; and from the quality of the Humour that raiſeth it, whether hot or cold, thick or him, malign or benign: for according to theſe circumſtances the Cure is more or leſs difficult.</p>
                     <p>The manner of its Termination is to be conſidered: whether by Diſcuſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> inſenſible Tranſpiration; or Suppuration, <hi>i.e.</hi> the converting the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour (which raiſed the Tumour) into Matter; or by Corruption, when the part affected is overcome by the ill quality of the matter, and putrefies; or by Induration, when the Tumour is hardened, and the Symptoms of pain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; or by Retraction, when the Tumour ſuddenly diſappears, going back into the Body.</p>
                     <p>All Tumours which own their original to Humours terminate one of theſe five ways.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1.<note place="margin">Signs of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</note> The Signs of <hi>Diſcuſſion</hi> are the Relaxation, Diminution, and eaſe of the part, without Suppuration.</item>
                        <item>2.<note place="margin">Of Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The Signs of <hi>Suppuration</hi> are Pain, Pulfation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Fever, according to Aphor. <hi>Hipp. Dum Pus conficitur, dolores ae febres accidunt.</hi> But the Matter being made, thoſe Accidents ceaſe, and the Tumour riſeth in a Cone, and appears whitiſh: alſo the Matter fluctuates under your fingers. Yet it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens in crude Tumours, and thoſe that lie deep amongſt the Muſcles, that Matter is not ſo eaſily diſcover'd.</item>
                        <item>3.<note place="margin">Of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The Signs of <hi>Corruption</hi> are a livid or blackiſh colour of the part affected, together with a ſinking of the Tumour.</item>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95669:11"/>
                        <item>4.<note place="margin">Of Indurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The Signs of <hi>Induration</hi> are, Diminution of the Tumour and Pain, with increaſe of Hardneſs.</item>
                        <item>5.<note place="margin">Of Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The Sign of its <hi>Retraction</hi> is, a ſudden diſappearing of the Tumour without Diſcuſſion or Suppuration: which, if it be from an inward cauſe, is always evill, and there ariſeth Fever, (if there were none before) together with grievous Symptoms from the return of the Matter.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of Tumours two things are chiefly to be conſidered:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 1. the nature of the Part; 2. the nature of the Tumour.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I.<note place="margin">Things to be conſidered in the Part.</note> In the <hi>Part</hi> it ſelf we are to conſider, 1. its Temperament, 2. its Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, 3. Situation, 4. Senſe, 5. Uſe.
<list>
                              <item>1. In <hi>Temperament,</hi> ſome are hot, as the Muſcles; ſome cold, as the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Glandules, and other exanguous parts. Some are moderately moiſt in themſelves, and require to be treated with Medicines of the like nature, ſuch as are neither violently drying, nor too much moiſtening, as the Fleſhy parts: others dry in themſelves, yet requires exiccants; as Bones: others again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with perpetuall Moiſture, by reaſon of their ſituation and ſpongy ſubſtance; as the parts about the <hi>Anus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus, Axillae, Inguina,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                              <item>2. <hi>Conformation</hi> of the Part regards either its outward Figure, or inward Compoſition: which latter may conſiſt of ſeverall other leſſer, whether ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or organicall; as a Thigh, of Bone, Muſcles, Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are duly to be conſidered, that ſo the nature of the Fluxion, the Veſſels that feed it, the diſadvantages or advantages of the Part, the beſt way of Revulſion, Diſcuſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be the more readily ſuggeſted to the fancy. We may alſo thereby be informed what Cavities or Interſtices may be there for the receit of Humour; and how great the degeneration is from the naturall ſtate or figure.</item>
                              <item>3. <hi>Situation</hi> of the Part is of great importance: which, if it depend too much, muſt of neceſſity be raiſed; otherwiſe the Fluxion will be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Therefore if it be a Hand or Arm, it muſt be raiſed to the Breaſt; if a Leg, it muſt be laid on a Bed, Stool, or the like.</item>
                              <item>4. The <hi>Senſibleneſs</hi> of Parts is of much moment in the Cure of Tumours: which, if they light upon ſuch as are of over-acute ſenſe, produce exquiſite torments, ſuch as require often a more peculiar care of the Chirurgeon then the Tumour it ſelf. Alſo its neighbourhood to ſuch a place obligeth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its reaching to it.</item>
                              <item>5. The <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of a Part, as it is more or leſs noble, is very much to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: whether it be of immediate importance to Life, as the Liver, Brain, Lungs, Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to great and noble uſes; whether of ſenſe, as the Eye, Noſe, Ear; or of common excretion, as the Bladder, <hi>Anus;</hi> or of generation, as the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus, &amp;c.</hi> Of all which Circumſtances great care is to be had, that they may be treated accordingly.</item>

                        </item>
                        <item>II.<note place="margin">Things to be conſidered in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</note> Having thus conſidered the nature of the Part, you are next to attend to the Tumour it ſlf, both as to its Time and other circumſtances. As to its Time, if it be already in the State, you have no more to doe but to regard the conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Matter already lodged there; the due removall of which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſpoſeth it to Cure: but if it be onely beginning, then the antecedent cauſes are to be likewiſe conſidered, and to be removed out of hand; the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be checked by evacuation of the Humour, by bleeding and purging, or by revulſion, derivation, interception, repulſion, diſcuſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Theſe ſeverall intentions will beſt be judged of by viewing the quality of the Tumour. If it be hot, and made by Fluxion, then it is to be treated by the aforeſaid Method. If it be cold, and made by Congeſtion, then purging onely with reſolvents, diſcutients, and ſtrengtheners of the Part, are to be made uſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95669:12"/>of. Where the Tumours are mixed, the intentions of Cure ought to be ſo too. Where Attraction is the cauſe of Tumour, the cauſe of the Attraction ought to be removed; whether it be too much heat, drawing Medicines, bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Plaiſters, or the like. All which things as they will be ſufficiently handled in the Particulars when we come to them; ſo it will be much for the advantage of the young Artiſt, if we do here ſay ſomething of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince Tumours cauſed by Fluxion are like to employ the former part of this Treatiſe, I ſhall begin with thoſe, and conſider them in their ſeverall eſtates, of Beginning, Increaſe, State, and Declination.</p>
                     <p>In the Beginning I have already told you of Bleeding,<note place="margin">Bleeding.</note> which potently checketh Fluxion, and ought to be proportioned to the greatneſs and violence of the Diſeaſe. In tender bodies and ſmall Tumours the evacuation needs not be much: but if otherwiſe the Fluxion be great, and the body ſtrong, we muſt take away large quantities.</p>
                     <p>Beſides Bleeding,<note place="margin">Purging.</note> evacuation by Stool will be requiſite: and, indeed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before or after bleeding a Clyſter or ſome other Lenitive ought to be exhibited. Nor is that to be reſted in, but further purging, either by milder or ſtronger medicines, to be attempted, ſuitably to the condition of the Patient. It is true that in hot Tumours there may ſeem to be onely a <hi>Plethora,</hi> which notwithſtanding will require evacuation by purging as well as bleeding; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeldom found that a Tumour is cauſed by a meer <hi>Plethora</hi> without <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymia;</hi> which <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> if it doth not precede the Tumour, certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth it, (as will be made more manifeſt when we come to treat of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Heads) and therefore requires the method now mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Lenitive Purges are <hi>Sena, Rhubarb, Caſſia, Tamarinds, Manna,</hi> with <hi>Cremor Tartar, Electuar. lenitiv. Diaprun. lenitiv. Diacaſſ. cum manna, ſyr. roſar. ſolut. ſyr. de Rhabarb.</hi> &amp;c. which is as high as we ought to go, if the Humour be hot. In cold ones ſtronger Catharticks are adviſable: of which more anon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two are premiſed in regard of the antecedent cauſe: but that is not enough, unleſs the conjunct cauſe be alſo removed; which, being the very matter of the Tumour, admits of ſeverall intentions. They are reducible to theſe two Heads.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Tranſlation to ſome other Part in the body: which is performed by, 1. Revulſion, 2. Derivation, 3. Repulſion.</item>
                        <item>2. Evacuation out of it: and that is obtained by, 1. Diſcuſſion, 2. Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 3. the Diſcharge of the matter by Apertion.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tranſlation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Revulſion.</note> and, 1. by <hi>Revulſion,</hi> is chiefly intended for the defence of ſome noble Part which is endangered by the Tumour, or elſe for the leſſening of the Matter when it is exceſſive. This intention regards as well the antecedent cauſe as the conjunct. The antecedent, when by Venaeſection, Cupping-glaſſes, Leeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the whole maſs of Humours is diminiſhed: of which already. The conjunct, when the Tumour it ſelf is leſſened, or quite taken off, by tranſlating it either into the maſs of Bloud, or into ſome other remote Part.</p>
                     <p>The former of which is often very innocently done in the beginning of a Tumour, whilſt the <hi>ſerum</hi> is yet onely extravaſated, and not otherwiſe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its quality; ſo that being remixed with the maſs, it is capable of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and conſiſtent with the health of the Patient. The latter is, when by Cupping, Bliſtering, Ligatures, Frictions, or the like, we raiſe a Tumour in the contrary part, and give Nature occaſion of diſcharging the Matter in a place far diſtant, which otherwiſe ſhe would have lodged here: in doing of which ſhe often ſucketh in the Humour again which ſhe had before ſeparated into the former place.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Medicines are all aſtringent more or leſs. The milder ſort of them, which are the moſt uſuall in all hot Inflammations, as Lettice, Purſlane, Navel-wort, Plantane, Bramble-tops, red Roſes, Knot-graſs, Horſe-tail, Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leek, and, where the pain is more vehement, Poppy, Mandrakes; theſe may be applied liquid, or in the forms of Liniments, Cerots, Cataplaſms, or Emplaſters: of which this Book will give you examples.

                     <p>Concerning theſe foregoing Medicaments it is to be cautiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">Cautions.</note> 1. That they are proper onely in the beginning of the Tumour, whilſt you intend to prevent it by driving it quite back into the Bloud again. For if the Humour be ſo impacted as not to be repellible, but that is muſt have its evacuation in the place by Suppuraiton, then if by bleeding you hinder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Matter, you prolong the Diſeaſe; Nature in that caſe wants all its heat and all its <hi>ſerum.</hi> Much more do you hurt it if you uſe Repellents, which, being commonly cold and aſtringent, do cloſe up the Pores, and keep out both the naturall heat and the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the bloud, the affluence of which and its mixing with the Humour is neceſſary to the dilution and the digeſtion of it; ſo that both being hindred, the Part will grow livid and mortifie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Caution is to be uſed in the application of theſe Medicines where the Tumour is malign, or the Criſis of a malignant Fever: for in all ſuch caſes the Retraction into the bloud is of very dangerous conſequence: wherefore we then rather uſe Cupping-glaſſes and other Attractions to draw it out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is to be noted that theſe Repellents are often applied above the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as defenſatives or intercipients: in which caſe they have regard to the antecedent cauſe, and in a ſtrict diſcourſe ſhould have been handled under that Head; but I rather accommodate my ſelf to the method of Operation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evacuation</hi> is neceſſary for the diſcharge of that Matter out of the body by ſome more immediate way, which either cannot, or ought not, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intentions be driven back. Now that is of three ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Diſcuſſion.</note> Inſenſible, by <hi>Diſcuſſion</hi> or Reſolution; which is nothing elſe but a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out the Humour by inſenſible tranſpiration. Therefore the Humour ſo to be diſcharged ought to be thin, and the skin lax and rare: for if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or lie deep amongſt the Muſcles, it will not eaſily yield to Tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Medicaments called Diſcutients ought to be hot and of a ſubtil qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, powerfully penetrating: which quality renders them improper to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95669:13"/>in the beginning of Inflammations; (for thereby the Part would be too much heated, and conſequently the Tumour made great;) but they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being mixed with Repellents: in the beginning of the Augment, when the Tumour is hard, and not fit to be treated longer with Repellents alone.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Medicaments are to be proportioned as the Matter and conformation of the Part requireth.<note place="margin">Diſcutients and Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> The milder are emollient and rarifying, proper in ſoft bodies where there is Inflammation with hardneſs: and they are <hi>Radices &amp; fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia althaeae, malvae, violar. ſem. lini, foenug. flor. chamaemel. meliloti, ſambuci, far hordei, lentium, orobi, lupinor.</hi> wihch may be made up in Cataplaſms with ſome of theſe following, which are of the ſame quality, <hi>viz.</hi> ſallet-oyl, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>axung. porcin. anſeris, anatis, gallinae, ſevum ovinum, vitulinum, vaccinum.</hi> The more recent theſe Fats are, the more emollient; and the more rancid, the more diſcutient. <hi>Mel</hi> and <hi>cera</hi> are reckoned amongſt the Diſcutients: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>ol. cham. lumbricorum, ſambuci, lini, irinum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Empl. diachyl. ſimpl. cum gummi, ireatum, de mucilag. de meliloto,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> If after the uſe of the milder Diſcutients propoſed in hot Tumours the Symptoms of pain and inflammation do not leſſen, you ſhall then forbear the farther uſe of Diſcutients, and haſten Concoction or <hi>Suppuration;</hi> which is indeed the work of Nature, by the benefit of whoſe heat the Humours are digeſted, and <hi>pus</hi> generated. If the heat be ſtrong, the Matter is for the moſt part well concocted; and being ſo, it is white and of good conſiſtence, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95669:13"/>not ill ſented: but if the heat be weak, the Matter is otherwiſe. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our work to cheriſh and increaſe the native heat in the affected Part, to perfect its Concoction: and that is furthered by hindering Tranſpiration, and defending it from outward air; alſo by proportioning the quality of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments to the temper of the Part, and quality of the Tumour. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as our naturall heat is temperate and moiſt, ſuch alſo ought the Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be: they ought alſo to be emplaſtick. Yet it is not unfrequent to ſee a Suppuration made accidentally by cold Medicaments, which by a light, gentle aſtriction of the Pores do perform the office of Emplaſticks; as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum album,</hi> Sorrell roaſted in embers. Nay, in cold Tumours I have ſeen Suppuration cauſed by the ſtronger Diſcutients.</p>
                     <p>Tumours do ſuppurate ſooner or later according to the Humour of which, or the Place in which, they are generated. Thoſe which are of Bloud, and in Fleſhy parts, do eaſieſt come to maturity. Thoſe which ariſe from other Humours, and are near or in the Joynts, or Parts endued with little heat, (eſpecially thoſe contained in a <hi>Cyſtis</hi>) do difficultly ſuppurate.</p>
                     <p>The Matter differeth according to the variety and mixture of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Of Bloud always proceeds laudable Matter, eſpecially if the native heat be ſtrong: but if other Humours be mixed with it, as they get predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy, ſo is the Matter more or leſs crude. In Furuncles or Boils it is clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and not unlike pith.</p>
                     <p>In Abſceſſes made by Tranſlation the Matter is purulent, ſometimes white and well-coloured, other times partaking of a yellow or green, ſometimes of a brown colour; and is more or leſs foetid according to the time it hath there remained.</p>
                     <p>Tumours made by Tranſlation have ſometimes Matter in them from their firſt appearance: but it being commonly lodged deep under the Muſcles, the Matter is not felt till it hath raiſed the Tumour; which is not done without pain, pulſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> but deeper, and doth not affect the skin with Inflammation till the Matter reach near it. In theſe Tumours we do not attend the Symptoms of Suppuration, but open them as ſoon as any quantity of Matter offers it ſelf. Whilſt the Matter is making, the native heat of the Part is to be preſerved and increaſed by Medicaments which may alleviate the pain, and further concoction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suppuratives</hi> are of two ſorts:<note place="margin">Suppurative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of two ſorts.</note> ſome are ſimple, others are compound. The ſimple are <hi>Aqua tepida,</hi> with which if you foment the leſſer <hi>Phlegmons,</hi> it will ſuppurate, (and ſometimes by continuing its uſe it will diſcuſs them, where the Matter is not fit for Suppuration.) <hi>Hydrelaeum</hi> moderately heats and digeſt. <hi>Oleum maturum</hi> cheriſheth the native heat, and ſupples and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts Matter. Butter is maturative, and is profitably mixed with Anodynes and Suppuratives, eſpecially in ſoft delicate bodies. <hi>Oeſypum</hi> is alſo matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and ſo are the Fats of all domeſtick Creatures. <hi>Fol. malvae, viol. parie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeriae, mercurialis, brancae urſinae,</hi> decocted in <hi>hydrelaeo cum farina tritici, buty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, &amp; vitellis ovorum,</hi> are Suppuratives. A raw Onion is ſharp and biting; but roaſted under embers loſeth its acrimony, and ſuppurates Tumours that are difficult to digeſt. The Lilly-root is a known Suppurative.

The Tumour being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated, be the Matter what it will, the evacuation of it is neceſſary, leſt it corrupt within, and corrode the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Tendons, or the Bone, if it lie near one: in which caſes it is lawfull to open it before the Tumour is all ſuppurated. So alſo in the Joynts, and in the Head, if the Abſceſs lie over the Sutures: likewiſe in Abſceſſes in <hi>ano,</hi> where, through the weakneſs of the Part, a putrefaction is apt to follow; or in the <hi>fauces,</hi> where the neighbouring parts may ſuffer by conſent, and the Patient be in hazard of ſtrangling. In theſe caſes we wait not for perfect Suppuration, but by deep Scarification diſcharge the ſerous bloud, and prevent an Abſceſs. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo care to be taken in Abſceſſes of the Breaſt and Belly, where the Matter is in danger of breaking inwards. Yet by opening theſe too ſoon they ſometimes apoſtemate again, or become crude, and difficult to digeſt and cure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Two ways of Opening. Inciſion.</note> The way of <hi>Opening</hi> them is twofold; by Knife, or Cauſtick. They are of uſe according to the place that is affected, and the quantity of Matter which is to be diſcharged. In the Face, where the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> may be unſeemly, <hi>Inciſion</hi> of them is beſt: but in large Abſceſſes, where the quantity of Matter is great, or where we would keep the Abſceſs long open, or in a place where Bandage cannot be made to retain the Tent in, there a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> is moſt proper. Authours do not generally approve ſo well of the Cauſtick; yet <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> propoſeth it in a <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> where it is leaſt ſafe: for in truth thoſe cold Tumours do eſpecially require to be opened by Inciſion; yet when the habit of body hath been tolerable, I have in that alſo uſed the Cauſtick with good ſucceſs, as I ſhall ſhew in the Cure thereof, and do commend it in the opening of large Abſceſſes as moſt ſafe and eaſie, the Matter being thereby diſcharged plentifully. And if the Cauſtick be applied in the declining part, the Abſceſs is ſometimes near cured before the Eſcar ſeparates, (if the Matter be not contained in ſome peculiar <hi>Cyſtis</hi>) and that without dilatation or Tents.<note place="margin">Caution.</note> Yet you ought to be wary how you make Fontanells with them in hydropick or very fat people, by reaſon of the weakneſs of their naturall heat.</p>
                     <p>Of <hi>Cauſticks</hi> there are various ſorts;<note place="margin">Cauſticks.</note> as of the <hi>lixivium ſaponis, cinerum ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. vitis ſiliquarum fabar.</hi> &amp;c. boil'd to a ſolid conſiſtence: or in the boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you may adde to them <hi>vitriolum Roman. pulver.</hi> from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. alſo <hi>opium</hi> ℈ ij. to ℥vj. of the <hi>lixivium:</hi> or by a mixture of <hi>calx viva &amp; lixiv. ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponis</hi> you may make a Cauſtick. Theſe are the ſtronger ſorts in uſe amongſt us: not but that there are Cauſticks made with Arſenick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, unleſs it be in great <hi>Sarcomata</hi> or ſuch like, I uſe onely a milde preparation of <hi>calx viva</hi> with a little common ſoap, and a third part of the Cauſtick-ſtone. In chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and tender ſoft bodies I often uſe <hi>calx viva</hi> made into paſte with a little black ſoap. In theſe two latter there is no fear of their ſpreading; a Pledgit of dry Lint and an Emplaſt. <hi>diachalciteos,</hi> or the like, is ſufficient defence, leaving them on till the next morning.<note place="margin">Caution.</note> But in the application of the ſtronger Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick there is more caution required. Thoſe we endeavour to keep within compaſs by ſmall ſnips of Emplaſt. hoping thereby to defend the parts about: but, in ſpite of all our endeavours, they will ſpread farther then was deſigned, if they lie any while on the Part out of our ſight. For though the Part be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly defended with Emplaſters, they will find a way under the skin, or at leaſt under the <hi>cuticula,</hi> to ſpread, according to the quantity of the liquid ſalt in the Cauſtick. They do your work in leſs then an hour.</p>
                     <p>The Eſcar being made, you may divide it, and ſtupe the part affected with wine or milk, and dreſs it up with <hi>unguent. buſilicon</hi> dipt in <hi>ol. lilior.</hi> warm,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95669:14"/>applying an <hi>Empl. diachalc. ſimpl.</hi> diſſolved in ſome of the ſame oyl to the conſiſtence of a Cerat: or apply an anodyne Cataplaſm, and bind it up.</p>
                     <p>In the opening an Apoſtem by Inciſion, you ought to take care that the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made in that place where the Matter is moſt contained, the skin being for the moſt part thinneſt there: and if it be not the moſt declining part, yet you may draw your knife towards it, for the more eaſie diſcharge of the Matter, then that the Inciſion be made according to the rectitude of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. If it be in the Groin or Arm-pit, it ought to be oblique: in other parts make it according to the length of the member.</p>
                     <p>In making the Inciſion you are to avoid wounding the Vein, Artery, or Nerve: nor muſt you diſcharge the Matter at once, eſpecially in great Abſceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, leſt you over-weaken the heat of the Part, or cauſe fainting.</p>
                     <p>The Inſtruments proper in opening Apoſtemations are made choice of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Part that is affected, and the greatneſs of the Abſceſs. <hi>Ambr. Parey</hi> propoſeth ſome whereby you may more covertly open them: but we make uſe of Lancet or Knife, of which our Inſtrument-makers furniſh us with choice. If the <hi>Fauces</hi> be affected, the Handle of your Knife ought to be long, and the Blade ſhort; ſome thereof crooked, and cutting on one or both ſides. Your Inſtruments ought to be kept clean, for your credit; and ſharp, that you may perform the work with leſs pain.</p>
                     <p>The Inciſion being made, the Accidents or Symptoms that attend it are to be removed. In the firſt place the Bleeding is to be reſtrained, if any ſuch happen, (which is very rare) with <hi>pulv.

                     <p>Having thus treated of Tumours by Fluxion, we ſhall now ſay ſomething of thoſe made by Congeſtion; which, though capable of moſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95669:15"/>intentions more or leſs, yet differ in the manner of governing them, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bleeding ought in this caſe to be leſs frequent; but Purging more ſtrong, with <hi>agarick, hermodactyles, ſcammony, jalap, aloes, colocynth, pil. rudii, cochiae, Cornachini, benedict. laxat. confect. hamech, elect. è ſucco roſarum,</hi> purging Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the Chapter of <hi>Oedema,</hi> to which I refer you. The Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath little or no place here.</p>
                     <p>Derivation by Iſſues and Setons are uſuall. Repulſion is proper in many of them, eſpecially that of Bandage in oedematous Swellings of the Legs, Arms and Hands.</p>
                     <p>But Diſcuſſion is the principall intention of the Chirurgeon in this place, and ought to be done with hot Medicines: of which ſort I have ſet you down ſome already, and more you will meet with in our particular Diſcourſe of thoſe Tumours.</p>
                     <p>Suppuration ſeldom happeneth in theſe Tumours, unleſs there be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of bloud with it: in which caſe treat them with Suppuratives, as hath been ſaid, and open them.</p>
                     <p>After Apertion, the method of healing differs little from that of Abſceſſes made by Fluxion: but of their Cure you ſhall be more informed in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Oedema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing that offers it ſelf to our conſideration is <hi>Diet:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diet.</note> and that is of two ſorts; the one regarding Tumours made by Fluxion, the other thoſe by Congeſtion.</p>
                     <p>In hot Tumours made by Fluxion we are to propoſe ſuch moderation as may take off from the great ferment in the Bloud, whereby it may be rendred leſs apt to flow into the weak Part. To which purpoſe the Ancients preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſuch a ſlender Diet as might onely ſupport their Strength: yet with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Cuſtom, the Age and Conſtitution of the Patient, and greatneſs of the Inflammation. If the body be ſtrong and abound with Humours, and the Inflammation great, their Diet may be the more ſparing and cooling; as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-grewell, Panado, and ſuch like. Where the Inflammation is leſs, or the Patient weak, Chicken-broath, with Wood-ſorrell, Lettice, Purſelane, or a boil'd Chichen, a potched Egg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like meats of eaſie digeſtion. To others, Mutton, Veal, Pullet, Rabbit, and ſome ſorts of the firmeſt Fiſh. In great Inflammations there is commonly Fever attending, in which caſe they have little inclination to eat. Their Drink ſhould be Ptiſans, or ſmall well-boil'd Ale. If Wine be allowed, it ought to be ſmall, or allay'd with water. <hi>Falopius,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of hot Tumours, ſaith, he was wont where there was <hi>Plethora,</hi> to preſcribe <hi>panem lotum in aqua, aſperſo ſucco aurantiorum cum modico zuccari,</hi> a little Bread dipt in water, and ſprinkled with juyce of an Orange and Sugar, and that but twice the day; and their Drink no better then water. <hi>Galen</hi> forbids Wine; yet permits it to them <hi>qui habent ventricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum debilem,</hi> for their Stomack'd ſake: which is neceſſary to be obſerved; for unleſs that be kept up, in vain are all our endeavours.</p>
                     <p>The Air ought to be temperate by art or nature.</p>
                     <p>All Exerciſe is to be forborn: for the Bloud is thereby heated, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours made more fluid. Sleeping in the day is alſo forbidden, out of hopes they may reſt better in the night.</p>
                     <p>In Tumours by Congeſtion we allow ſuch a Diet as is heating and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating; their Meat rather roaſted then boiled, and of good nouriſhment; as Mutton, Veal, Kid, Pullet, Rabbit, Chicken, Pheaſant, Partridge, Cock, Snipe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All White-meats, Fiſh, Fruits, Sallets, are forbidden. Their Drink may be Ale or Beer: Wine is alſo allowed in theſe caſes: and their Drink
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95669:16"/>may be medicated with <hi>Sarſaparilla, China, lign. guaiaci, lentiſcinum;</hi> as you may ſee more particularly hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Air ought to be warm and attenuating. Sleep in the day is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbidden, and ought to be moderated in the night. Paſſions of the mind are to be avoided both in this and all other Diſeaſes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Inflammation, or Phlegmon.</head>
                     <p>HItherto I have diſcourſed of Tumours in generall. I ſhall now deſcend to particulars, and begin with <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> or <hi>Inflammation:</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the firſt degeneration from good bloud, and in its own nature nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of kin to it; and alſo becauſe it is the moſt frequent of Tumours hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in Diſeaſes, Wounds, Contuſions, Fractures, Luxations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It being alſo the uſuall forerunner of many miſchiefs that happen in many of thoſe caſes, and conſequently the moſt obvious occaſion of exerciſing the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Skill.</p>
                     <p>I define it,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> a large Tumour, hot, of a red colour, with pain, pulſation, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a circumſcribed hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of it are either from the Situation;<note place="margin">Differences.</note> inward, or outward. Or from the Part affected, whence it taketh a name. As inwardly in the Lungs it is called <hi>Peripneumonia;</hi> in the <hi>Pleura, Pleuritis;</hi> on the <hi>Diaphragma, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrenitis,</hi> in the Brain, <hi>Phrenitis;</hi> in the Throat, <hi>Angina:</hi> outwardly, on the Throat, <hi>Angina notha;</hi> in the Eyes, <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> &amp;c. Or, laſtly, from the Matter: which if ſimple, it is a ſimple <hi>Phlegmon;</hi> if compound, it hath its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Humour with which it is compounded, and ſo is called <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latodes, Phlegmatodes, Oedematodes, Scirrhodes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> is generally a <hi>Plethora,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> having ſome acrimonious mixture in the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the Bloud; which latter is the uſuall matter of a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> being caſt out of the veſſels, and lodged in the pores of the Skin, or other Part affected with it. This <hi>ſerum</hi> being accompanied by the thinner parts of the Bloud grows red and angry, and, wanting its due regreſs into the Maſs, firſt gathers into a hard Swelling, and in few days (if it be not diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) ripens into Matter, and ſo diſchargeth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> are,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> great pain, heat, inflamed red colour, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with hardneſs, pulſation, and tenſion. The Tumour growing big and more collected, a Suppuration ſucceeds, and then the Symptoms abate. As the Tumour riſeth into a Cone, ſo the Matter may be felt to fluctuate, and the Skin becomes thin and pale, <hi>viz.</hi> of the colour of the ſubjacent Matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> is good,<note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note> when the Tumour inſenſibly exhales and reſolves: in which caſe the ebullition abates, and the Bloud, being leſs violent in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſſeth gently by, and by degrees ſwalloweth up that Humour into its chanells again which it had in the time of its ebullition caſt out; or at leaſt, having ſuffered the thinner parts to tranſpire, it receiveth the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Next to this way of terminating a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> Suppuration is beſt, when the Matter of the Tumour ripens into a kindly <hi>pus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is of ill conſequence if the Tumour diſappear without abatement of Accidents, and the Fever ſtill continue. In this caſe either a Gangrene or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95669:16"/>ſome other grievous Symptome ſucceeds: or, if it were the Criſis of a Fever, that encreaſeth, and the Life of the Patient is in great danger.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo ill when the Matter, in ſtead of reſolving, hardens, and the pain ceaſeth. It foreſheweth a ſcirrhous Tumour approaching.</p>
                     <p>Fat people are not ſo eaſily cured as lean. Nervous and tendinous Parts have worſe Symptoms, and are harder of Cure, then fleſhy ones.</p>
                     <p>If after great Abſceſſes the Body be not purged and regulated, they are apt to fall into ſome other Diſeaſe: otherwiſe they occaſion much Health.</p>
                     <p>The modern Authours have reduced the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Tumours to four heads:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 1. to the manner of Living; 2. to the preventing the Influx of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; 3. to the evacuating the Humours already inflowed; 4. the correcting of the Accidents to which they are ſubject.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The manner of Living conſiſts in the moderation of the ſix <hi>non natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> As, that the Diet be ſlender, cooling, and moiſtening, whereby the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of bloud may be moderated, and rendred leſs apt to flow into the weak Part: from which conſideration the Ancients, as I told you, allowed onely enough to preſerve their Strength, with regard to their Habit of Body and Cuſtom of living. They generally preſcribed Panadoes, Barley-grewell, and ſuch like Spoon-meat. Chicken-broth is the higheſt whilſt the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is fermenting; but after Suppuration and diſcharge of Matter, greater liberty is permitted. Air, Exerciſe, Watching, Paſſions of the mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be regulated; as hath been ſaid in the preceding Chapter of <hi>Tumours in generall.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The ſecond intention is performed by removing the Cauſe of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is the Plenitude and <hi>Cacochymia:</hi> the former whereof requires Bleeding, the latter Purging. Bleeding is here propoſed as the ſpeedy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, both for leſſening the Tumour, and appeaſing the Pain; and is made by opening a vein near to the Part affected. According to <hi>Galen, debemus venam ſecare ad deliquium animi,</hi> we ought to draw bloud to very fainting. Yet we are therein to conſider the Conſtitution and habit of body, and greatneſs of the Inflammation.

                     <p>The Fever which attends Pain is removed by Venaeſection, or by the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſuppuration of the Tumour. If it ſhall unhappily indurate or gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, I refer you to thoſe Chapters of <hi>Scirrhus</hi> and <hi>Gangraena:</hi> yet I think, if the method be rightly obſerved which hath been propoſed, there will need no ſuch reference.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſafe and ſpeedy way of curing <hi>Phlegmons</hi> is by Reſolvents. In Wounds, Contuſions and Ulcers, Inflammations for the moſt part go off ſo: and ſo would the greateſt <hi>Phlegmons,</hi> if the foreſaid method were truly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But the neglect of timely Bleeding, and the too haſty application of Pultices of White-bread and Milk, render them incapable of Repellents; and for the moſt part of Diſcuſſion: whence followeth a neceſſity of Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>The Medicaments that further Suppuration are ſuitable in their temper to the heat of the Part, ſo as to cheriſh it, and of an emplaſtick quality, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Tranſpiration. So Oyls and Greaſe, which are ſcarce permitted in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients, (farther then to give good conſiſtence to the Medicine) are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

                     <p>The going off of the Accidents of pain, heat, pulſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are good ſigns of Suppuration: but if the Matter lie deep, the Symptoms do not ceaſe till it be diſcharged; nor is the Suppuration diſcerned in ſome of them otherwiſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95669:17"/>then by the fluctuation between your hands. In ſuch caſes, if you doubt Suppuration, continue the latter Cataplaſm: for if the Tumour be opened before the Matter be well concocted, it will be the ſlower in healing.</p>
                     <p>If the Tumour become more compact, and thruſt out in a Cone, and look pale, defer not the opening of it. For as the opening of Apoſtems before the Suppuration be perfected weakens the heat, and renders them crude: ſo the letting the Matter lie long after it is made gives way to its putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Parts underneath corrupt, and the Abſceſs becomes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous.</p>
                     <p>The manner of opening by Inciſion or Cauſtick, together with all directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary thereunto, have been ſufficiently treated of in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Cure of it, by digeſting, deterging, incarning and cicatrizing, you will ſee in the Treatiſe of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> and in the following obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin them with ſome inſtances of <hi>Phlegmons</hi> in their very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: though I may doubt whether you will allow them for ſuch, they being then ſo inconſiderably ſmall, that the Patient himſelf thinketh it not worth while to ſend for a Chirurgeon. Nay, when the pain hath increaſed the Inflammation, and raiſed the Swelling big and hard, they for the moſt part permit them to be dreſſed by the next pretender to Chirurgery with Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, as I have ſaid, of White-bread and Milk, and do not conſult us till the Tumour be in its ſtate; and then it is too late to repell them. Sometimes we may diſcuſs them, but more frequently they ſuppurate, and are of longer Cure. Upon the conſiderations forementioned, it ſeemeth not eaſie for me to give you ſuch inſtances of the beginning of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> as may be ſuitable to the deſign of this Diſcourſe: therefore I have ſet down the fewer of them, and taken them from ſuch accidentall cauſes as do generally make great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, (if ill handled,) that you may thereby learn how to prevent their growth by the timely applications propoſed in the method of Cure.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about thirty ſix years old,<note place="margin">1.

The next morning he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me of his ill night's reſt by reaſon of that pain, he not being able to move that Joynt. I embrocated the Part with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Empl. diachalcit. cum bolo,</hi> and let him bloud in the Arm about ℥x. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him a Clyſter that afternoon, and an Anodyne draught the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> vj. <hi>ſyr. de meconio in aq. papaver. cum aqua cinnamomi hordeat.</hi> whereby he reſted better.

I then cauſed a Bryony-root to be digged freſh out of the earth, and being waſhed, cut and beaten to a pulp in a Stone-mortar, I chafed the pained Hip with it, and applied it in the form of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm. It did not lie well on, but by the uſe of it two or three days it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed his pain, and he was cured.

Obſervat. of a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> of a full body, ſubject to Gout and Scurvy, was taken with a Fever, which after a few days terminated in a pain of his right Arm about the <hi>Biceps,</hi> with Swelling and Inflammation. Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms were applied of White-bread and Milk: but the parts were thereby relaxed and rendred more ſubject to Fluxion, which ſwelled the Arm round and deep amongſt the Muſcles. A Chirurgeon was fetched, who, finding the Patient weak and treated by unhappy hands, declined the meddling with it, as not having been conſulted more timely; or, indeed, doubting how the Cure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95669:18"/>would ſucceed. I was then fetched, and obſerving the Tumour great, and threatning the deſtruction of the Member, I ſtuped it with Wine, to give a breathing to it, till I could make a Fomentation more for my purpoſe; which I haſtened by putting a ſhovell-full of Wood-aſhes into a quantity of water with a few herbs; as <hi>ſummitat. abſinthii, centaur. cardui bened. flor. ſambuci, chamaemeli, ſem. foenugraeci,</hi> &amp;c. Which being boiled and ſtrained, I added Brandy-wine to it, and fomented the ſwell'd Arm, and the while made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm <hi>ex far. hordei &amp; fabar.</hi> with ſome of the aforementioned Ingredients boiled in ſome of the ſame Fomentation, with the addition of <hi>mel com.</hi> and applied it. Being thus left alone to act without a Phyſician, I let him bloud in the other Arm, and preſcrib'd a Clyſter and a Cordiall Julep of <hi>aq. dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont. cardui bened. &amp; citr. ſpec. de hyacintho, cum ſyr. de ſucco citr. &amp; caryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phillor.</hi> with <hi>aq. epidemica,</hi> alſo an Anodyne draught to diſpoſe him to reſt that night; which he did better then he had done many nights before. By the uſe of the Fomentation and Cataplaſm the Swelling diſcuſſed, and our work went hopefully on: the Fever appearing then but ſymptomaticall leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo, as the heat and pain mitigated. My next work was by Emollients to reſolve the hardneſs which poſſeſt the Muſcles and Tendons of the Arm and Elbow-joynt. To which purpoſe I fomented them with a Decoction of <hi>fol. &amp; radic. althaeae, malvae, tapſi barbati, rad. lilior. flor. chamaemeli, meliloti, ſem. lini, foenugraeci,</hi> &amp;c. made in Fleſh-broath, and embrocated them with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>unguent. dialthaeae cum ol. lumbric. ex pedibus bovinis,</hi> and applied <hi>cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Agrippinae,</hi> with moderate Bandage over all. Thus I reſolved the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſomewhat reſtored the Joynt: but the Arm continues weak to this day.</p>

But this Patient being of a very ill habit of body, the Tumour increaſed, and, collecting more round, ſhewed its inclination to ſuppurate: wherefore I left our the Repellents, and added <hi>rad. lilior. albor.</hi> &amp;c. by the application whereof it ſuppurated in few days after. I opened it by Cauſtick, and diſcharged a proportionable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Matter well concocted, and haſtned the fall of the Eſcar by Lenients. During the Fluxion (which was in the Wriſt amongſt the Tendons) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a foreneſs in that <hi>Axilla,</hi> but took little notice of it, till, after the opening this, (the pain diminiſhing there) he felt that in his Arm-pit more ſore.

Obſervat. of a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Breaſt.</note> of a groſs body, receiving by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident a blow on her right Breaſt, it ſwelled, and grew hard and painfull. After ſeverall applications, the hardneſs and pain rather increaſing, ſhe, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a Cancer, came to me. I viewed it, but ſaw no Symptoms of it. I embrocated it <hi>cum oleo &amp; aceto roſac.</hi> and applied an <hi>Empl. de minio cum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,</hi> and the day after let her bloud, and then purged her with Whey, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Cremor Tartar; by which the hardneſs was ſeemingly reſolved for ſome time: but ſhe being irregular in her appetite, it ſwelled again as when I firſt ſaw it. Upon which conſideration I applied Emollients; and ſeeing the Tumour increaſe, and ſhe impatient at the ſight of it, I applied a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cataplaſm <hi>ex rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, rad. lilior. alb.</hi> &amp;c. By the continued uſe of it in a few days it ſuppurated well, and I opened it by Cauſtick in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part, and diſcharged a large quantity of Matter. I dreſſed the Abſceſs with lenients, and continued the uſe of the Cataplaſm till the Eſcar ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: then I deterg'd with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> and applied <hi>Empl. de mucilag.</hi> and ſhortned the Tent. The Orifice growing leſs, and ſomewhat of the hardneſs yet remaining, I put in a ſhort <hi>Cannicula</hi> of Lead, and kept the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice open, till the hardneſs was totally reſolved, and that it matter'd very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or not at all; then threw out the Tent, and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. diapompholig.</hi> and permitted it to heal: which it did in few days. This was a pure <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and lay deep in the Breaſt, and owed its ſpeedy Cure to the perfect Suppuration was made in it before the Opening. For otherwiſe ſuch Abſceſſes in large Breaſts do frequently terminate in ſinuous Ulcers, and grow callous, by reaſon of their laxity and want of naturall heat.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about fifty ſix years of age,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                        </note> ſtanding long in the cold to ſee ſome extraordinary Show, was taken with a pain above his left Hip, and the ſecond day after ſent to me for an Emplaſter. The meſſenger not telling me the name of the Patient, nor where he lodged, I ſent him an <hi>Emplaſt. è bolo,</hi> proper to reſiſt, and defend a Part from, Fluxion. The fourth day after he ſent to me for another Emplaſter, ſignifying to me that his pain was much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and two days after ſent for me. I went, and ſaw a large Tumour lying upon the <hi>Ilion</hi> backwards, with great Inflammation and hardneſs, with all the Symptoms of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> near its ſtate. I directed a Cataplaſm to be made <hi>ex ſummitat. malvae, biſmalvae, abſinthii, flor. ſambuci, meliloti, ſem. lini, foenugraeci, far. hordei,</hi> with an addition of <hi>mel commun. ol. cham. vitell. ovor &amp; croc.</hi> and in the interim let him bloud, and adviſed a Clyſter to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred that afternoon. If this perſon had been of a temperate life, and been let bloud when he ſent for the firſt Emplaſter, this Tumour might have been happily repelled; but it was now too late to diſcuſs it: yet I repeated the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Cataplaſm till I ſaw it more collected, and then I haſtned Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, by one of the milder Suppuratives ſet down in the method of Cure; by the uſe of which the Tumour was more collected and raiſed into a Cone, and by its pale colour and thinneſs of the skin gave an aſſurance of a perfect Suppuration. Then I applied ſome of the milder Cauſtick, with an <hi>Empl. diachyl. ſimpl.</hi> over it, and the Cataplaſm over all. The next day I took off the Dreſſings, with deſign to divide the Eſcar: but it was done to my hands, and a large quantity of a well-digeſted Matter was diſcharged. I fomented the Abſceſs with a Stupe wrung out of Milk, and dreſſed the Eſcar with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> dipt in <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and continued the application of the Cataplaſm. Thus in few days the Swelling aſſwaged, and the Eſcar ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. I then endeavoured Deterſion with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi:</hi> but the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95669:19"/>being large, and the Suppuration in the middle, and the Part not very capable of Bandage, there remained a large hollowneſs, which put me upon a neceſſity of laying it more open, for the ſpeedy effecting the Cure; which I did with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors. This work is neceſſary in ſuch large <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi> and therefore it is, I ſuppoſe, that <hi>Sennertus</hi> places his Chapter <hi>de Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubus</hi> next to that of a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> After I had made this Inciſion, I dreſſed it with that Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi,</hi> &amp;c. and having digeſted it, I incarned, by adding <hi>pulv. rad. iridis, ariſtoloch. rot. ſarcocoll.</hi> &amp;c. to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive: and by the help of the Vitriol and Alume-ſtones, <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and <hi>Emplaſt. diachalciteos,</hi> I cicatrized it.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Civill Wars a Gentleman in the Weſt-countrey was ſorely pained with an Inflammation and Swelling upon the <hi>os Ilion</hi> on the left ſide.<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</note> Some one apply'd to Cataplaſm to it of White-bread and Milk with Hogs-lard; a Medicament proper to aſſwage pain, but being applied in the augment in a full body, it relaxed the parts, and made way for the influx and increaſe of the Tumour. Upon farther complaint, ſome other of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance adviſed the application of Houſeleek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which the native heat ſuffocated, and the Part gangrened. Sir <hi>Alexander Fraſier,</hi> chief Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to his Majeſty, and my ſelf were fetched, and ſaw the Tumour black and ſunk the compaſs of the palm of an hand. We made deep Scarifications, and waſhed it with a Solution of <hi>Aegyptiac. in ſpir. vini,</hi> and filled the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed parts, eſpecially in the circumference between the ſound and gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned parts, with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and applied over all a Cataplaſm, ſuch as you will find ſet down in the Chap. of <hi>Gangraenae.</hi> Where we had applied our Precipitate, we found a perfect white Matter: it was but little in quantity, but by the uſe of the ſame Powder we ſaw the Mortification ſtopt, and the Eſcar in few days after ſeparated with good digeſtion. The Ulcer was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deterged with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> and cured by Epuloticks, as in the Cure of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Phlegmons</hi> are ſubject to mortification through unſeaſonable application of Medicaments in time of their ſtate;<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after Opening.</note> ſo alſo in fat bodies they are apt to gangrene after Opening, if that Fat be not ſpeedily digeſted out. Thus it happened to a perſon labouring of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> on the <hi>Os ſacrum.</hi> After the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Matter the Ulcer became crude and gangrened. Another Chirurgeon was conſulted, who ſcarified the Abſceſs, and by his warm applications ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he had extinguiſhed the Mortification: but it appearing otherwiſe, I was fetched, and ſaw the lips and parts within gangrened and gleeting. We ſcarified the lips: but finding them to be gangrened more within then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, we pared them off round, then ſcarified the Abſceſs within, and cut out the putrefied Fat, and with an armed Probe dipt in <hi>oleo garyophyllor.</hi> hot clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Abſceſs, and fill'd the Scarifications with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> We then dreſſed up the Abſceſs with a mixture of <hi>unguent. baſilicon &amp; ol. terebinth.</hi> and applied Cataplaſms and Fomentations, as is uſuall in ſuch caſes. The next day we came provided with actuall Cauteries, but found the Abſceſs warm, and diſpoſing to digeſtion in the lips and fleſhy parts: and from that time it digeſted well. But in the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Ulcer, where the Mortification had reached to the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> the ſlough ſeparated more ſlowly: but by the warm application of Lenients it came off, and the Ulcer happily incarned.</p>
                     <p>Over-ſtrict Bandage is a frequent cauſe of <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> of which I do make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation for the cautioning of the yong Chirurgeons in the caſe of Fontanells.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of a plethorick body, aged about thirty years, being ſubject to hot Defluxions of ſharp Rheum,<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of ſtrict Bandage.</note> was adviſed to make a Fontanell in her Arm by Cauſtick. I applied the milder, with an Emplaſter and moderate Bandage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95669:20"/>to retain it on, with advice to ſlacken it, if there appeared cauſe. The next morning ſhe told me the bandage had been eaſie all the day, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhe had not ſlackened it; but it pained her in the night, and ſwelled her Arm. It did not ſeem too ſtreight; nay, I think if it had been ſlacker, it would have ſlipt down her Arm, being taper-grown: but the Tumour ſhewed the Bandage to be too hard. I looſened it, and took off the Cauſtick; where finding a ſmall Eſcar, I divided it, and dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> with an Emplaſter to retain it on, leaving the Arm at liberty. She was eaſie that day; but about twelve of the clock at night ſhe was waken'd with the pain, and ſent to me. The Fontanell not being in fault, I returned her a glaſs with <hi>ol. cum aceto</hi> to embrocate her Arm. The next morning I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited her: there appeared leſs fulneſs and no heat, but ſhe complained of a numbneſs in her Hand. I left her to the uſe of the Oyl: it wore off in a day or two. After the ſeparation of the Eſcar, I put in a Pea, and fitted it with Bandage: from which time it continued eaſie. I foreſaw this diſturbance, and adviſed her to bleed and purge firſt, but could not prevail.</p>
                     <p>In fat fleſhy Arms you may produce the like by a moderate ſtrict Bandage, when the Humours are in a fermenting diſpoſition. The way to avoid ſuch inconvenience is, firſt to make evacuation by bleeding or purging: for from ſuch little beginnings greater evills do follow. And if this Fontanell had been made by the <hi>lapis cauſticus,</hi> it had penetrated deep, and might by ſuch a flux of Humours have been ſhrewdly diſturbed: or if it had beem made by Inciſion, it would have been inflamed; and then the concluſion would have been, that it was made upon a Nerve or Tendon; though poſſibly in ſuch fat Arms there is none within half an inch under it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall give you another inſtance in a Gentleman who came out of the Countrey,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of over-ſtrict Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> and put himſelf into the hands of a Chirurgeon, in which caſe I was conſulted. The Tumour was in his left Arm upon the <hi>Biceps,</hi> and was cauſed by over-ſtrict binding of his Iſſue. It was raiſed below the Bandage; and as it abounded with Matter, it diſcharged it ſelf into the Fontanell. The Cure was performed by the application of a Cauſtick upon the lower part of the Tumour, and the Matter was let out by cutting deep into the Eſcar; after which it was digeſted and incarned by the ſaid Chirurgeon, as in other Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes is uſuall.</p>
                     <p>Many inſtances we have of this kind in Infants, who cannot expreſs their grievances, eſpecially where Iſſues are cut in their Arms. The Nurſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times binding them too ſlack, whereby the Pea ſlides out, and the Iſſue being almoſt cloſed before the next dreſſing, they, to recover their errour, force in another, and by too hard Bandage raiſe a Tumour with Inflammation, to the great diſturbance of the Child.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſomewhile ſince a Child in my neighbourhood was ſeized with an Inflammation from the Shoulder down to the Elbow,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of Gangrene from over-ſtrict Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> and from thence an oedematous Tumour reached to the Fingers ends, the Fontanell it ſelf gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grened. I threw out the Pea, and ſcarified the lips of the Ulcer, and dapt it with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> hot with an armed Probe, and applied Pledgits dipt in a mixture of the ſaid Oyl and <hi>unguent. baſilicon;</hi> and having fomented it well with a <hi>decoct. abſinthii,</hi> &amp;c. I applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. hordei &amp; fabar.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in <hi>Oxymel</hi> oever that part of the Arm, and upon the remote parts I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> with good Bandage from the Hand upward. By this means the Humour was modrately repreſſed, and breathed forth, the Eſcar alſo ſeparated in the Fontanell; after which the Ulcer incarned with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sarcoticks, and the Ulcerations about it were cured by <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and ſuch like Epuloticks.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95669:20"/>
                     <p>A perſOn of about fourty five years of age,<note place="margin">15. Obſervat. of <hi>Phlegmon eryſipeluto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                        </note> ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diſeaſes from plenitude and <hi>cacochymia,</hi> as Lethargy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was lately in danger of ſinking under an Apoplecticall Fit, but was freed of it by a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe Humours into his right Leg, with great pain, and an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a deep red colour poſſeſſing onely the skin; but the Swelling was great, reaching from the gartering to the very Toes. It was <hi>Phlegmon eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelatodes,</hi> and in his caſe required to be breathed forth by Medicaments of a temperate quality, yet ſomewhat cooling. To which purpoſe I preſently fomented it with Claret-wine, and applied <hi>ceratum Galeni</hi> over all the Leg, with a moderate Bandage; then let him bloud, and directed him a Clyſter. The next morning I took off the Dreſſings, and found his Leg in a better condition. I bathed it with Claret-wine wherein I had boiled <hi>ſummitat. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinthii, ſalviae, flor. ſambuci, roſ. rub.</hi> and applied the <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> as before, and continued that method ſome days; he purging himſelf the while with Whey, <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>cremor Tartar.</hi> Thus the heat remitted, and the Swelling relaxed: yet the <hi>Cuticula</hi> was fretted off in ſeverall parts, and I felt a ſmall collection of Matter under the skin on the inſide of the Anckle, which I gave vent to by an Apertion with a Lancet, and diſcharged about a ſpoonfull of a thin white Matter. I applied a Pledgit of <hi>baſilicon</hi> upon it, and dreſſed the Veſiacations with <hi>unguent. tutiae;</hi> by which in three or four days they were cured: after which I put him a laced Stocking on that Leg, whereby it was reduced to its right tone. I had made him Fontanells <hi>inter ſcapulas</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which he continues to good purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A Maid aged twenty four years was ſeized with a pain in her Head and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of a Fever;<note place="margin">16. Obſervat. of <hi>Phlegmon eryſipelato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                        </note> the ſecond or third day ſhe had an Inflammation in her right Leg a little above her Knee and ſo downward. After ſeverall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Perſley, Butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſaw it. The Inflammation was in the Skin, and reached down from the Knee in a red ſtreak about four fingers breadth to the Inſtep: that inflamed Skin was tenſe, but ſeemed to have Matter lying under it. I made Apertion with a Lancet on the Knee, and diſcharged a well-concocted white Matter. I then made another Apertion lower, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the loweſt part, with like ſucceſs: the bloud alſo trickled down in good quantity from the little wounds in the skin. I permitted them to bleed, ſhe having need of ſuch an Evacuation; then dreſſed them up with <hi>unguent. baſilici cum vitello ovi</hi> upon Pledgits of Lint, and applied <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> over them with convenient Bandage. The next day ſhe was purged with <hi>Elect. lenitiv.</hi> and her Leg was ſtuped with <hi>decoct. ſalviae, betonicae, flor. roſ. rub.</hi> We dreſſed the Apertions as before. This Maid was lately come out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and, by reaſon of the change of Air and courſe of life, abounded with Humours which required Evacuation: therefore during her Cure I let her bloud, and purged her twice or thrice, by which ſhe was reſtored to health; and the Matter having been ſo opportunely let out, the Inflammation went off, and the Apertures cured by a few dreſſings of <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi>

                     <p>A Man aged about fourty years,<note place="margin">17. Obſervat. of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> by Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of a healthfull complexion, haſtening from <hi>London</hi> (in the time of the laſt great Sickneſs) to his houſe in the Country by great journeys on horſe-back, to avoid Infection, which the Inns on the Road were ſubject to, choſe to reſt himſelf on his way by lying down in the fields, whilſt his horſe baited on the graſs near him. But having heated his body by journeying, he took cold by lying upon the ground, and in riſing felt a great pain in the region of his right Kidney, and returned to his houſe very ill. He conſulted the Phyſicians in his Neighbourhood. They at firſt ſuſpected ſome Diſeaſe in that Kidney: but there being no Symptoms of it in his Urine, they imputed it to other cauſes, and preſcribed Remedies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95669:21"/>But the Cure not ſucceeding, they adviſed him to <hi>Buckſtone Waters</hi> in the County of <hi>Derby:</hi> whither he went, and returned more pained. I, being at that time in a neighbouring County, was ſent for, and found him in his bed much emaciated. From the region of that Kidney down to his Hip and Thigh there appeared a more then ordinary fulneſs, and in that Groin there was a painfull Swelling, in which there ſeemed to be Matter, but it lay deep: I applied to it a ſuppurative Cataplaſm <hi>ex foliis &amp; rad. althaeae, rad. lilior. albor.</hi> &amp;c. to ſuppurate it. To the other pained parts I applied <hi>Empl. è bolo.</hi> By the uſe of the Cataplaſm the Tumour <hi>in Inguine</hi> appeared daily more full of Matter, and ſeemed to me to be made by Tranſlation; therefore I did not attend a perfect Suppuration, but applied a Cauſtick, and, cutting into the Eſcar deep, diſcharged a much greater quantity of Matter then that Cavity was capable of; beſides, by its foetid ſmell it ſeemed to have been long made. I dreſſed it up with Lenients. From this Dreſſing his pain leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened; but the Matter which diſcharged daily from it was very much. I made a ſearch with a Probe, and felt it paſs under the <hi>Pubes</hi> into the Muſcle <hi>Pſoas,</hi> (as I conjectured:) upon ſight of which I contented my ſelf in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Orifice open for the diſcharge of the Matter, and preſcribed him Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraries. The fulneſs from the region of that Kidney to the Hip continuing exceeding painfull, I made a Seton upon the latter, hoping thereby to give a vent to that Humour. The firſt three or four days it matter'd little; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, in drawing the Seton, the Matter burſt forth in great quantity: upon ſight whereof I cut the two Orifices into one, and took out the Seton, and dreſſed it up with Lenients. This was a foetid purulent Matter, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be of the ſame kind with the other which diſcharged from his Groin. His next great complaint was of pain in the region of that Kidney. I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the original Matter might ariſe from thence, and paſs inwardly to the Groin, and outwardly to the Hip, thought, if I could give a vent there, it might poſſibly intercept the Matter in its courſe to the other Abſceſſes. I therefore applied a Cauſtick upon the moſt likely part. The firſt four or five days after the diviſion of the Eſcar there appeared no Matter; but before it was quite ſeparated it made its way plentifully out, and the other Abſceſſes were more governable, and the Patient was certainly much relieved. But one afternoon, while he was lying in bed, and telling us a Story of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſages in his Profeſſion, he ſuddenly died, we ſuppoſed from an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Artery; for we found much bloud poured forth from all the Abſceſſes, but eſpecially that on the region of that Kidney. During the time of his ſickneſs his Urine was without Bloud or Matter, and paſſed freely without the leaſt diſturbance. I would gladly have opened his body, but was not permitted.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Tumours from Milk.</head>
                     <p>MIlk (though I cannot ſay that it is often the matter) is certainly the occaſion of many Tumours of divers kinds. I know Authours make it the materiall Cauſe of many of the Diſeaſes of the Breaſts: but ſuch men muſt be underſtood warily. For if by <hi>Milk</hi> in this aſſertion they mean Milk actually generated, and ſeparated from the Bloud, then I know but few ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in which that can be ſuppoſed to be the matter of a Diſtemper: for when it is in that condition, it is laid up in certain <hi>tubuli lactei,</hi> which, being ſpred all over the Breaſt, do unite their branches after the manner of Veins, ſtill growing into bigger trunks, till they do end at laſt in the Nipple. Now the motion of this Milk being <hi>de vaſis minoribus in majora,</hi> what is once ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Bloud in the Glands of it into thoſe Veſſels hath nothing to ſtop its progreſs till it comes to the very place of its <hi>Exit</hi> from the Nipple. If any ſtop preternatural;y happen, as the compreſſion of the Veſſel by ſome Tumour of a Glandule, or the like, then indeed a varicoſity of the lacteous Veſſels may ariſe: of which caſe you may ſee an Obſervation in the Chap. of <hi>Varix.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This caſe is rare; but there be others very frequent: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules through which Milk is ſeparated may either through fault of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which they make that ſeparation produce divers variety of Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95669:22"/>or through an indiſpoſition of their Pores not permit a due percolation of it from the Bloud. When any of theſe things happen, there is a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the Circulation, and Fluxion doth ariſe, which ſoon produceth a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſuitable to the Humour ſo ſtirr'd up; <hi>viz. Phlegmon, Oedema, Scirrhus, Scrophula,</hi> yea ſometime <hi>Cancer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Diſcourſe may ſerve for a generall account of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the <hi>milky Tumours</hi> of the Breaſts, and may eaſily be enlarged to ſuch particular caſes as may emerge.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> may thus be enumerated.<note place="margin">Differences.</note> If the Ferment of the Breaſt be over-active and vigorous, it ſeparates Milk with too great violence, cauſing thereby an over-fermentation in the Part, which uſually produceth a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> if the <hi>ſerum</hi> be hot, or partake much of Bloud: othewiſe it raiſeth an <hi>Oedema;</hi> or, if Matter diſpoſe to coagulation, a <hi>Scrophula:</hi> which are the moſt frequent ſpecies of Tumours generally reputed to ariſe from Milk. Any of theſe three may degenerate into a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> and that <hi>Scirrhus</hi> into a <hi>Cancer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are viſible.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> If the firſt happen, there are all the Symptoms of a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> heat, redneſs, tenſion, pulſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if the ſecond, large diſtenſion, with pain, but no heat: if a <hi>Scrophula,</hi> then hard kernells are eaſily felt and diſtinguiſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tumours made by the over-eagerneſs of the lacteous Ferment goe eaſily off,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> if no other Symptome attend them: ſucking and drawing the Breaſt for the moſt part diſchargeth the Milk as faſt as it can be generated, and then all the evill is over. But if the Fermentation produce any diſorder in the Bloud, the Patient finds more or leſs of danger according to the quality of the Tumour produced: <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> endangereth them of a Fever; oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are apt to grow ulcerous, and ſometimes ſcrophulous and ſcirrhous, and become long of Cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as it frequently happeneth to women in Child-bed, that their Breaſts do extraordinarily ſwell by reaſon of the abundance of Milk which floweth into them, and that it ſtirreth up Inflammations, Apoſtemations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore their <hi>Diet</hi> ought to be ſlender, and of ſuch quality as may leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Humours to ferment: to which purpoſe I ſhall refer you to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation preſcribed in a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Medicaments proper to diminiſh the Milk are,<note place="margin">Cure of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> in the Breaſt.</note> Lettice, Purſelane, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Succory, Smallage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſeeds of wild Rue, Cummin, Baſil, powdred and given to the quantity of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. daily in Broath, will dry up the Milk, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours write.</p>
                     <p>The Milk is uſually drawn out of the Breaſts by the infant's ſucking them: but in caſe the Child be ſo weak it cannot ſuck, or doth not enough empty them, ſome others are to be admitted to help them; or they may put young Whelps to ſuck them, or ſome neighbouring woman. But the Mother may draw her own Breaſts her ſelf by an Inſtrument ſold for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Tumour made by the Milk is reſtrained by the application of Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhade, Lettice, Plantane, Vine-tops, Bramble-buds, Horſe-tail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>ol. roſ. myrtill. cum aceto,</hi> &amp;c. as we uſually treat <hi>Phlegmons</hi> in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>It may be diſcuſſed by the application of Mints, Catmints, Rue, <hi>ſem. foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugraec. cumini, foeniculi,</hi> &amp;c. or dried up by the applying cloaths dipt in <hi>aqua calcis,</hi> or a Solution of <hi>ſacchar. Saturni in aqua ſermat. ranar.</hi> during which time fine Towe may be ſprinkled with Ceruſe, and applied to the Armpits. But in the beginning of Fluxion we are rarely conſulted.</p>
                     <p>Where I have by chance come in to women that have been much pained with ſwelling in their Breaſts from Milk, I have applied <hi>Emplaſt. è b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Green Mints or Chickweed are common applications, and of good uſe, either alone, or mixt with other Medicaments, in all the hard Swellings of the Breaſt occaſioned by Milk. All Emplaſters applied to the Breaſts ought to have a hole ſnipt in them for the Nipples, leſt they be fretted by them; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that the Milk may be drawn forth while the Medicaments lie on.</p>
                     <p>A Young Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> endeavouring to dry up her Milk when it was too late, put her Breaſt upon Apoſtemation. I preſcribed her an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Cataplaſm, and a day or two after applied a Cauſtick, and gave vent to the Matter; then dreſſed the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and applied <hi>cerat. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>althaeae</hi> over the whole Breaſt, and left her of the ſame Medicaments to dreſs her ſelf with, and once in two or three days viſited her. After the Eſcar ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and the Matter was well diſcharged, I dreſt her with <hi>unguent. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompholyg.</hi> and left her of the ſame to finiſh the Cure. Many of theſe, where the Matter hath lain ſuperficiall, I have cured as eaſily.</p>
                     <p>A young Women after Child-bed was vexed with a Swelling in her Breaſt.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat,</note> One was fetcht who poſſeſt her Relations that it was a Cancer, and treated her accordingly. But her Breaſt growing more painfully, her Father, much apprehending the danger of ſuch a Diſeaſe, came to Sir <hi>Fran. Pr.</hi> and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with his Daughter's Diſtemper, and the Judgment that had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it; deſiring that he would inſtantly goe with him to ſee his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Phyſician, wary in giving his Judgment in Chirurgery where there might happen any diſpute, adviſed the Father to take me along with them. We went together, expecting to ſee a Cancer in the Breaſt: we found her in bed bemoaning her condition. I viewed her Breaſt, and ſaw it very big and inflamed, and felt it all apoſtemated, and the Matter perfectly well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated, the Skin thin and ready to break. I could ſcarce believe what I felt and ſaw. I declared the ſwelled Breaſt to be a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> well ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and fit to open. The Phyſician looked and felt it; but, being prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the contrary, did not readily give credit to what he felt. I then propoſed the applying a Cataplaſm of White-bread and Milk, aſſuring them before morning they ſhould find a Porrenger-full of Matter diſcharged. They conſented unto it. We took our leaves, and left them to apply it; they did ſo: and the next morning the old Gentleman made the Phyſician a viſit, and confirmed the truth of what I had foretold, and by the uſe of <hi>unguent, baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> cured it without farther trouble.</p>
                     <p>The Matter being well ſuppurated, and a convenient Opening made for diſcharge, they generally heal of themſelves, if the Habit of body be good: but where it is otherwiſe, or irregularly treated, there it is vexatious in the Cure.</p>
                     <p>While I was dreſſing a Patient in a Citizen's houſe,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat,</note> I was deſired to look upon the Breaſt of the Gentlewoman of the houſe. She had lately layn in,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95669:23"/>and from abundance of Milk and ill handling her right Breaſt had been apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemated, and was broken out in many holes. A woman famous in the City for dreſſing ſore Breaſts was her Chirurgeon. I obſerved that the Breaſt had at firſt broke in the upper part in a ſmall pin-hole; and the Matter, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſufficient diſcharge, had ſubſided, and ſo made the other Openings, and afterwards paſſed an inch lower then any of the Openings, and could not be diſcharged otherwiſe then as it fill'd up the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and ran over, or was preſt from below upward with her hand. By this means the Breaſt continued inflamed and apoſtemated; inſomuch as it was impoſſible to cure it by that method till it had apoſtemated the whole Breaſt. I pitied the Patient, and wondred that a woman ſo famed for ſuch Cures could be ſo ignorant, and yet preſerve her credit with that Sex.</p>
                     <p>I ſhewed the Patient the cauſe of her pain, and the unlikelihood of being ſuddenly cured by ſuch a Chirurgeon, and prevailed with her to permit me to lay on a Cauſtick upon the depending Part; and having made an Eſcar the compaſs of three-pence, opened it, and gave vent to the Matter, and left her a little <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> to apply daily upon that Orifice, and ſome <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> to dreſs the reſt. By the uſe of which ſhe was cured in few days without more directions from me. Yet the good Gentlewoman, I dare ſay, is of ſo kind a nature, as ſhe would quarrel in defence of her Sho-Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman after Child-bed being indiſpoſed in her health,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> her left Breaſt became diſeaſed, and ſwelled. They contented themſelves with ſuch help as thoſe about them could afford. But after ſome days it growing more painful and ſwelled, the Apothecary brought in his Brother, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Suppuration, and after ſome while gave vent to the Matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Cure. But while he was dreſſing that Opening, the Fluxion increaſed, and other Abſceſſes were raiſed, and from the ſeveral Apoſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſinuous Ulcers were afterwards made. Thus the work became difficult. I was conſulted. In the pulling out one of the Tents, a thin white Matter iſſued out in great quantity: my Brother Chirurgeon called it Milk; but I thought it Matter, and obſerved the Abſceſs to have begun deep in the body of the Glands, which, through length of time corrupting them, rendred the Swelling hard, and the Tent ſtopping in the Matter between Dreſſings had occaſioned that large diſcharge we then met with. The method of Cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the enlarging of that Orifice where the Matter ſeemed to be detained, and then to proceed with Deterſives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They entertained me in the Cure, and I continued my Brother Chirurgeon. We began with the application of a Cauſtick to the Part round about the Orifice, ſtopping the hole with Lint; by which means in a ſhort time we made an eaſie way for the Matter, and ſaw no reaſon afterwards to think it Milk.</p>
                     <p>As the Eſcar ſeparated, a <hi>Fungus</hi> thruſt forth, which we ſprinkled with <hi>pulv. praecipit. rub.</hi> dreſſing up the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and the other Openings with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> and <hi>cerat. dialthaeae</hi> over all. After a more full ſeparation of that Eſcar, we, obſerving the <hi>Fungus</hi> to riſe more large, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Stupe wrung out of a <hi>decoct. ſummitat. abſinth. rutae, menth. flor. roſ. rub. balauſt.</hi> made in wine and water; and the while ſent for ſome <hi>chalcanthum,</hi> which we applied upon the <hi>Fungus,</hi> and Pledgits of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated parts. The ſecond day after we took off Dreſſings, and found an Eſcar made by the Cathaeretick, which we thruſt off, and dreſſed it again with the ſame, and continued the uſe of Eſcaroticks. During thoſe applications we applied over the Breaſt the <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> to reſtrain the Influx: but yet the <hi>Fungus</hi> increaſed upon us, and raiſed a Swelling between that and the other Orifices. Upon which conſideration we applied a large Cauſtick upon that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95669:23"/>Swelling, which laid ſome of the other Orifices into this; then divided the Eſcar, and dreſſed it up with Lenients, and covered the <hi>Fungus</hi> with Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, where-ever it began to thruſt out, by which it was kept down. But after the ſeparation of this later Eſcar, we ſeeing the <hi>Fungus</hi> great, and the way of extirpating it by Eſcaroticks ſlow, and fearing the ill conſequences of it, I preſt with my finger under it, and at once broke into it, and pulled it but in pieces; then fill'd up the place with <hi>Merc. praecip.</hi> and <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> upon Pledgits, with the foreſaid Emplaſt. over the whole Breaſt, and bound it up. The ſecond day after that we opened it again. And by this ſame method often repeated we ſubdued the remainder of the <hi>Fungus,</hi> and raiſed a firm <hi>baſis</hi> on which we incarned, with an addition of <hi>pulv. rad. ireos, myrrhae, ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocollae,</hi> to the forementioned Mundificative; and then applied <hi>cerat. agrippae</hi> over the Breaſt, and in few days cicatrized it with a ſmooth <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> the lips falling in by the benefit of nature, which was aſſiſted the while by Traumatick Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in ſuch caſes is uſual.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth very often, when we have cured one Breaſt, the other ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, from the abundance of Milk, and grows hard and apoſtemates. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have both Breaſts thus diſeaſed at one time.<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> Such was the caſe of a Gentlewoman in <hi>Clerkenwell:</hi> both her Breaſts had been long ſwelled, and after apoſtemated, by reaſon of the pain; ſeveral Abſceſſes were, made, and their Matter diſcharged by ſuch Openings. In progreſs of time the Ulcers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſinuous and callous, with induration of the Glands. I was entertained her Chirurgeon, and began my work with Fomentations and Cataplaſms diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and reſolving, as <hi>rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, hyoſcyami, ſummit. cicutae, menthae, rutae, flor. ſambuci, ſem. foenug. lini,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>far. lentium, hordei, axung. porc. anatis, anſeris,</hi> &amp;c. and in dilating the Orifices, and deterging with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> with <hi>Merc. praecip.</hi> and <hi>alumen,</hi> as I ſaw cauſe. While I was thus trying my endeavours by the method aboveſaid, new diſturbances aroſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which put me upon the neceſſity of laying ſuch places open by Cauſtick as might beſt ſerve for the diſcharge of Matter. After ſeparation of the Eſcar, I again deterg'd and healed them, as hath been ſhewed in ſuch like Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>How they are to be treated when they are ſtrumous, ſcirrhous, or cancerous, you may ſee in their proper places.</p>

                     <p>If the body be cacochymicall, the Tumours are apt to degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very venemous and malignant Abſceſſes; which if they do not ſuddenly kill, do at leaſt produce ill-conditioned Ulcers hard of Cure, and for the moſt part mortall in the long run of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Abſceſſes you are to inform your ſelf how the Womb is diſturbed,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and appeaſe that: and if any part of the After-birth be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, to endeavour the bringing that away, and by good Sudorificks, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to expell the venome, and fortifie the ſpirits againſt the malignity that is thereby contracted, and to contemperate the heat and acrimony by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps and Emulſions.</p>
                     <p>The Swellings ariſing from theſe require to be treated in their beginning with moderate Repellents and Diſcutients. Afterward, accordingly as the Matter predominates, make way for its diſcharge; and cure them as in the Treatiſe of <hi>

                     <p>A Young woman after Child-bed was ſeized with a great pain and Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in her left Groin and Thigh with Fever.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh</hi> and Doctour <hi>Weatherly</hi> were conſulted. They preſcribed Bleeding and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Purgatives, to evacuate the Humours; alſo cordiall Juleps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate the heat, and fortifie her ſpirits againſt malignity. I was alſo call'd in, and by moderate Repellents mixt with Diſcutients in Fomentations and Emplaſters with Bandage diſperſt the Humour in the Thigh, and reſtored that Part to its former temper: but in the mean time the Tumour increaſed in that Groin. I ſuppurated it after the manner of a <hi>Bubo,</hi> opened it, and endeavoured Deterſion: but the <hi>Sinus</hi> reaching down the Twiſt, the Matter could not be diſcharged without laying it more open, as in ſinuous Ulcers; by which method I cured it.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman in Child-bed was ſeized with a Fever,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> and the ninth day complained of a pain in her right Foot. Sir <hi>John Hinton</hi> was the Phyſician, who treated her in the Fever, and had preſcribed Diſcutients, to breath out the impacted Matter in her Foot: but the pain increaſing, I aſſiſted, and ſaw the upper part of the Foot from the Inſtep to the Toes oedematous, but from the inſide of the Ancle to the middle of the Sole of her foot inflamed, and ſeeming to apoſtemate. We, doubting the ill conſequences of an Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Part amongſt the Tendons and Bones, and where the Skin is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo hard and tough as our ſtrongeſt Cauſticks will difficultly penetrate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95669:24"/>to endeavour a reſtraint of the Influx, and ſo dry up the Humour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Part: to which purpoſe we applied this; ℞ <hi>far. hordei</hi> ℥vj. <hi>ſem. lini pulv.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>flor. cham. ſambuci pulv. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>flor. roſ. rub. balauſt. an.</hi> ℥j. Theſe were boiled in red Wine, with the additon <hi>mell. roſ. &amp; ol. myrtill.</hi> to the conſiſtence of an Emplaſter. It being night, ſhe was laid to reſt with an Anodyne draught.</p>
                     <p>The next morning I found the Patient ſomewhat relieved, and taking off the Dreſſings ſaw the Tumour and Inflammation leſs. I continued the way of dreſſing, and applied <hi>Empl. è bolo,</hi> as an Intercipient, about the Ancle and upper part of the Foot, and by Compreſs and Bandage dreſſed it up. By the application of theſe Medicaments we dried up the Humour in few days, and the Foot was ſeemingly well; but (whether it was for want of purging, there being ſome reaſon againſt it, or that the Humour was onely reſtrained by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Dreſſings) there appeared again a Swelling on the Foot, and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtemated in the Sole of the foot in three ſeverall places; which I opened by Cauſtick, to prevent the increaſe of Matter, and, dividing the Eſcars, gave vent to it, dreſſing them up with Lenients, Pledgits of <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and the Emplaſt. as before. I endeavoured daily by Compreſs and Bandage to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the flowing down of the Matter: but the poſition of the Foot gave way, and it ſunk lower, and put me upon the neceſſity of intercepting its farther deſcent to the Heel by applying another Cauſtick, which proved effectuall to the diſcharge, ſo that the upper Orifices healed. But this laſt Eſcar ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſlowly, and left the great Tendon bare. I furthered its ſeparation by the uſe of <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> applied warm, and incarned the Tendon with a Sarcotick compoſed of a mixture of <hi>pulv. ireos, myrrh. ſarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collae, &amp; Merc. praecipitat.</hi> with <hi>mel roſar.</hi> and <hi>terebinth.</hi> and cicatrized the Ulcer with Epuloticks. After it was cicatrized, the Sole of her foot was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed and tender, that upon the ſetting it on the ground it became very much ſubject to pituitous Swelling: upon which account I cauſed ſuch a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to be made as is propoſed in the Cure of <hi>Oedema,</hi> and put on a laced Sock, by which the weak parts were ſtrengthned, and ſhe cured.</p>
                     <p>A Lady in the Country of about twenty eight years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> having gotten ſome hurt in Child-bed, was taken with a Fever, and about four days after was diſturbed with a pain in her right Groin near the <hi>Os ilion,</hi> which in a few days after ſwelled with Inflammation, and became a large Tumour, reaching from thence over the Belly to the <hi>Os pubis</hi> like a rowl of White-bread. They ſent for Mr. <hi>Robert Morrey,</hi> an expert Chirurgeon of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who met Doctour <hi>Smith,</hi> an eminent Phyſician of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> The Lady did not permit them to ſee the Tumour, whereupon they could give no certain Judgement of it, but preſcribed an anodyne Cataplaſm, which her women applied. Some few days after the Abſceſs brake, and then Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> was fetched again, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to dreſs it. The Abſceſs was large, and diſcharged a great quantity of crude Matter making its way through the Skin by many eruptions. He purpoſed the laying them into one: but the Patient not admitting of it, the Matter inſinuated it ſelf deep amongſt the Muſcles of that part of the Belly. She was then adviſed to take a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> but would not yield to it. In progreſs of time the diſcharge of Matter rendred her lean and hectick: and at laſt, when ſhe was almoſt waſted with her Diſeaſe, ſhe was brought to <hi>London</hi> in a Litter. Sir <hi>Fr. Pr.</hi> and my ſelf, being ſent for, conſulted with Mr. <hi>Morrey.</hi> We viewed the Ulcer, and found it ſeated above the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> ſtretching towards the <hi>Os ilion,</hi> diſcharging a purulent Matter. We dreſſed it with a proportionable Tent armed with <hi>unguent. baſilicon, Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and <hi>Empl. diachalcit.</hi> It was upon conſultation reſolved that the <hi>Sinus</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95669:25"/>laid open in order to the Cure; which accordingly was ſnipt up about two inches with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and the inciſed Lips dreſſed with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi.</hi> We afterwards proceeded with Detergents, <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> &amp;c. After which Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> took his leave of the Lady, and returned to <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Whilſt I treated this ſinuous Ulcer, ſhe took her Vulnerary drinks and Balſamicks, alſo cordial Juleps made out of diſtill'd Milk wherein had been infuſed proper ingredients to diſpoſe her bloud to a better temper. But ſhe continued weak notwithſtanding all our endeavours, and the Ulcer would not cure farther then it was laid open. Therefore with one ſnip more I laid it open to the very end, and dreſſed it with Digeſtives, with good hopes of Cure. But after ſome days, finding the Matter not leſſen, I made a ſearch, and felt a <hi>Sinus</hi> penetrate into the cavity of the Belly under the <hi>Os ilion.</hi> Conſidering the original of the Diſtemper, I judged it to penetrate into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> or neighbouring Glands, which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed were much ſwelled and ulcerated, and would be a work of time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſed to her the removing to ſome neighbouring Village, to take the benefit of the air. She did ſo, and while ſhe was there I cured the <hi>Sinus</hi> to the very penetration, and did hope that it might have been kept as a Fontanel. But it continued to matter very much. Upon which a Conſultation was call'd, wherein the deceaſed Mr. <hi>Ed. Molins</hi> adviſed a Salivation by <hi>Merc. dulcis.</hi> She aſſented unto it, and to that purpoſe ſhe was brought again to her Lodging in Town; and by a few Doſes of <hi>Merc. dulcis</hi> a Salivation was raiſed, by which the Matter leſſened, and the Ulcer dried. But a Soreneſs affecting her Mouth, as is uſual in Salivation, gave occaſion to a Chirurgeon, ſince dead, to inſinuate himſelf into the Lady's Family, where he inveighed ſo much againſt the proceeding by <hi>Mercury,</hi> as leſſened my credit with them; ſo that I was not capable afterwards to ſerve the Lady. Yet I prevailed ſo far, as that Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſier</hi> was conſulted; to whom (in their preſence) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the condition of the Patient, and the method of our proceedings. He approved of what had been given, and aſſured the Lady it was the onely way to cure her; and that if ſhe would drink a good Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> with the Specificks uſually preſcribed in ſuch caſes, and afterwards put her ſelf into a diet of Aſſes milk, ſhe might enjoy a good health, and be obliged to acknowledge the good ſervice I had done her. But ſhe was prepoſſeſſed with the ſcandal of Salivating, and went out of Town a few days after, and, I ſuppoſe not following the method preſcribed, proper after <hi>Mercury,</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under a Conſumption, as ſuch people generally doe. No <hi>Mercury</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, where the preſcribed method is not obſerved.</p>
                     <p>An Apothecary's wife living in my neighbourhood in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> after a hard Child-bed Labour, was ſeized with a Fever, and great pain in her right Thigh, from the Groin and Hip downward to the Knee, ſwelling the Member round, without Inflammation or diſcolouring the Skin. Sir <hi>Fr. Pr.</hi> was the Phyſician, and I think Sir. <hi>C. Scarb.</hi> The Chirurgeons were Mr. <hi>Bing</hi> and my ſelf; and in the time of my Sickneſs Mr. <hi>Meredith</hi> a Chirurgeon dreſſed her. We fomented the Parts diſeaſed with <hi>decoct. ſummitat. abſinth. majoranae, beton. flor. roſ. rub. cham. meliloti, ſummit. anethi, ſem. lini, foenug.</hi> in wine and water, and made a Cataplaſm of the ſame Faeces with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>far. fabar. orobi</hi> and <hi>lentium,</hi> with <hi>oxymel, ol. cham.</hi> &amp;c. But the whole Member being oppreſt and weakened by the Influx, it apoſtemated, and Matter was felt to fluctuate in ſeveral parts. We opened the moſt likely places by Cauſticks, and gave vent to a large quantity of purulent Matter. Then dreſſing the Eſcar with Lenients, we applied the Cataplaſm and rowled it up. She was ſomewhat relieved, but reſted ill that night. At the next
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95669:25"/>dreſſing we enlarged the Opening with a pair of Sciſſors, and gave more way to the diſcharge of the Matter. Afterwards we continued our care in dreſſing her, and made other Apertions in parts more declining, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Deterſion by <hi>mundif. ex apio,</hi> &amp;c. and by Injections made of <hi>rad. ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoloch. rad. conſolid. ireos, ſarcocollae, thuris, myrrhae,</hi> decocted in <hi>aq. hordei</hi> with <hi>mel roſ.</hi> Many endeavours were uſed to cure theſe Ulces; but the Matter grew more corroſive, and the fleſh within diſſolved, and we felt the Thigh-bone bare. The Humours all emptied themſelves upon this weak Part; and, notwithſtanding all our endeavours, the Patient languiſhed, and died in the ſpace of eight weeks.</p>
                     <p>I was alſo called to another,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> who in Child-bed laboured of an Ulcer in her left Hip; the Fleſh was corroded round the breadth of the palm of a hand, the whole piece ſeparated and fell off from the Bone, leaving it bare, and the lips of the Ulcer ſordid without Inflammation or Tumour. I dreſſed the Bone with <hi>extract. ſcordii</hi> diſſolved in <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and the Ulcer with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. cum Merc. praecipitat.</hi> Traumatick Decoctions, Balſamicks, Cordials, Opiats, Juleps, were preſcribed, and our work went on ſucceſsfully a while, the Bone exfoliating from the edges; and the lips of the Ulcer digeſted and incarned with Sarcoticks <hi>myrrhae, aloes, ſarcocollae, cum ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis.</hi> But in the while a vehement pain ſeized the other Thigh, and it apoſtemated. We opened it on the out-ſide, and felt the Bone carious: we gave vent to a foetid Matter. I treated it as hath been ſaid in the former Obſervation: the Matter daily poured out, and the Abſceſs grew more hollow. To adde to her affliction, ſhe was tormented with a pain in her right Shoulder and in her left Knee, ſo that ſhe was neceſſitated to lie upon her Hips, which exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. At length the great diſcharge of Matter and extremity of pain waſted her, Oedematous Swellings aroſe in her Legs and Feet, and ſhe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and died.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman was brought to bed in the Country, and,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> being ill delivered, became indiſpoſed with a Fever, and was pained in ſeveral parts of her body. I found her grievouſly afflicted with corroſive Ulcers lying deep in the fleſh to the Bone: whole pieces of fleſh ſeparated from the <hi>Os coccygis,</hi> and came off, leaving the Bones bare as that of a Skeleton. The fleſh alſo fell off in round pieces from ſome other parts of her body. Upon the left Side, a little below her Breaſt, whilſt I was with her, I ſaw it begin with a round crack in the Skin, the compaſs of a Five-ſhilling-piece in Silver, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inflammation or Swelling, or other Matter then a little <hi>Sanies.</hi> It pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated deeper every day, and in three or four days fell off from the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> that covered the Ribs. I was much at a loſs what to dreſs theſe Ulcers with while they were cracking, for they were dry and without tumefaction of the lips. What the actual Cautery might here have done, I do not know. I ſprinkled <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> in ſome places, and in others <hi>alumen uſtum</hi> mixt with Praecipitate. I fomented ſome of them with lenient Decoctions, as <hi>rad. althaeae, conſolid. fol. malvae. ſem. cydon. pſyllii,</hi> and the like. Others I treated with <hi>decoct. abſinth. rutae, ſcordii, centaurii, cardui benedict.</hi> made in a Lixivie, and Cataplaſms were accordingly applied; but nothing check'd them. After the Skin and Fleſh were ſeparated, the remaining lips looked as fleſh parboil'd; yet they afterwards digeſted, and became better-conditioned; but this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſo many places of her Body diſeaſed, as ſhe had not one free part to lie on. Our whole endeavours (after ſhe was dreſſed) were, how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive Pillows to give her eaſe. The womens work was, to quilt them ſeveral ways, and make this and that part hollow ſuitably to the caſe: ſome parts of the Pillows had to that purpoſe holes cut in them. Many ways were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95669:26"/>but all to little purpoſe. She was always reſtleſs, frequently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and roaring for eaſe. I being quite tired, Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> a Chirurgeon was ſent for, and relieved me. I ſoon returned again, and ſtayed till I grew diſeaſed my ſelf, and with much difficulty returned home; then another Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon was ſent thither: and before I recovered of my own Sickneſs, I heard that ſhe died moſt painfully.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of an</hi> Eryſipelas.</head>
                     <p>AN <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is generated of a hot <hi>Serum</hi> in the Bloud,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> and affects the ſuperficies of the Skin with a ſhining, pale, red or citron colour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pulſation or circumſcribed Tumour, ſpreading from one place to antoher. It begins for the moſt part with ſome little Rigour, and is continued with a Fever.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Serum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differences.</note> according to its ſeverall degrees of receſs from its naturall ſtate towards that of Choler, doth produce ſeverall Diſeaſes. When the Receſs is leſs, and the ſharpneſs of it but little, then it doth onely cauſe a reddiſh Bluſh upon the Skin: from which the name of <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is, or at leaſt may be, derived; which is therefore by ſome great Authours reckoned amongſt the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous Tumours, becauſe its colour repreſents Bloud. But what will they then ſay of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> that appears yellow, as moſt of them do? why ſhould not this colour give it a new name from Choler? But I ſhall in this ſubmit to the minds of others. However I dare adventure to adde, that a farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards acrimony maketh an <hi>Herpes;</hi> and if the acceſs of acrimony be very great, it maketh an <hi>Herpes exedens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Tumours are not alway ſimple, but do uſually mix themſelves with other Humours, and from thence get additionall Epithets; as <hi>Eryſipelas oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matodes, phlegmonoïdes, ſcirrhodes,</hi> &amp;c. But that which I propoſe to treat of is the <hi>Eryſipelas à Sanguine bilioſo,</hi> from cholerick Bloud, which affects onely the outward Parts, none of which eſcape its tenuity and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Face, Head, Breaſt, Back, Emunctories, Thighs, Legs and Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, when Bones lie bare, (and ſo become as it were externall Parts expoſed to Air) they are alſo ſubject to the ſame Malady; as we too frequently find in Wounds of the Scull and other Fractures.</p>
                     <p>The Humour it ſelf ſimply conſidered is very thin and ſharp, much affecting the Pores of the Skin, in which it uſually lodgeth; and in a great meaſure oweth its confinement thither to an occluſion of them, they being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a <hi>Cuticula,</hi> whoſe denſity hinders tranſpiration, from whence vered with a <hi>Cuticula,</hi> whoſe denſity hinders tranſpiration, from whence pain and redneſs ariſe: and oftentimes other Humours are invited thither, ſo that the Tumour enlargeth, and becometh compound. Whilſt it is ſimple, the Skin onely is the ſeat of it, or the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> or a Bone that lieth bare: when it is compound, it will affect the Fleſh alſo, and other neighbouring Parts.</p>
                     <p>The Matter of this <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is already deſcribed to be a thin cholerick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> The Fountain of it is the Bloud, which by its capillary Arteries diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth it upon that Part, as often as in bilious or malignant and peſtilentiall Fevers it is provoked thereunto. And this, if the diſcharge be ſufficient, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95669:26"/>called <hi>Criticall:</hi> if it be not ſufficient, but that Nature, having diſcharged part of the Matter, lieth down under the reſt, we call it <hi>Symptomaticall.</hi> So alſo when it appears in the beginning of a Fever, it is then reckoned as a Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome thereof. Sometimes the Fever is vulgarly eſteemed a Symptome of it, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is firſt taken notice of, as if it had preceded the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: whereas indeed there is no <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> that hath not a Fever, either viſible or latent, going before it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Externall Cauſes</hi> do alſo concurre to the production of an <hi>Eryſipelas;</hi> as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions,<note place="margin">Externall Cauſes.</note> Fractures, and ſuch like; alſo the heat of the Sun, Fire, ſharp Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which have this effect in cholerick Bodies, where the Bloud, being turgid with that Humour, meets with any occaſion of ſeparation of Parts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> are,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> a ſhining yellowiſh colour mixt with red here and there vehement, heat, with a pricking pain bliſtering the Skin, and creeping from one place to another. How it differeth from a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> may eaſily be diſcerned by comparing them: This lieth ſcattering in the Skin, ſcarce raiſing a Tumour; whereas the <hi>Phlegmon</hi> lieth deep amongſt the Muſcles, with elevation and circumſcription, and is of a deep red colour.</p>
                     <p>A ſimple <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is not accompanied with cruell Symptoms:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> there is a Fever, but that diminiſheth as the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> increaſeth, according to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm of <hi>Hippocr.</hi> When the Matter is ſent from within outward, the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera</hi> are relieved, and the Patient recovers. This we ſee frequently in great Diſeaſes. But <hi>ab exteriori introredire malum,</hi> the ſudden return of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour inward is a bad ſign, ill Symptoms frequently following, yea Death, eſpecially if the Emunctories were affected. Suppuration in an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is not good, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in his Commentaries on the ſame Aphoriſm, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of malign <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> which in ſuppurating do for the moſt part corrupt; as we ſee by the diſcoloured <hi>Puſtulae</hi> which ariſe about them. Alſo an <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> upon a bare Bone is ill; and if a <hi>Delirium</hi> happen, the hopes is leſs. That <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> which goeth off by Tranſpiration is beſt.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> you are to conſider the Habit of body:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> for whilſt it abounds with bilious Humours, there is no admitting of Repellents; and by Diſcutients you will increaſe the heat, and conſequently the Diſeaſe. Therefore we proceed in the Cure of this, as hath been ſaid in a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> by Diet, Pharmacy, and Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>Their Diet ought to be, as in hot Tumours, very ſparing, Grewells, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, and Chicken-broth, with cooling Herbs: their Drinks, Ptiſans, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-cream, Emulſions, and Juleps made of diſtill'd Waters, as <hi>aqu. borrag. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviae, acetoſae, lactucae, portulacae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum ſyr. è ſucco citr. limon. granat. rub. idaei. violar.</hi> and the like; avoiding Wine in theſe Diſeaſes. The Ancients allowed onely Water, and to weaker ſtomacks Beverage. Reſt and Quiet of mind is here to be deſired, and the Belly to be kept ſoluble.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Phlebotomy there hath been much diſpute amongſt Writers; but they all agree that the Patient be let bloud, in caſe the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> flow upon Wounds and ſuch like accidents, or where it affecteth the Head or Throat. In the former of them it is allowed to prevent a <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> which otherwiſe might enſue; and in the latter a Squinancy, in which there is danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation. But if the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be ſimple, and but in the Skin; we are then by Purgations onely to evacuate the redundancy of Humours, and prevent the ebullition of Choler. The Purgatives ought to be lenient, ſuch as have been preſcribed in a <hi>Phlegmon:</hi> as <hi>caſſia, tamarinds, manna, cremor tartar. rhabarb.</hi> &amp;c. in Whey, or in Decoctions of Barley and opening Roots, with Syrups <hi>è cichor. cum rhabarb.</hi> and <hi>de rhabarb. de roſ. ſolutiv.</hi> alſo the <hi>Elect. leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95669:27"/>diacathol. diaprun. è ſucco roſ.</hi> Clyſters are alſo moſt proper in theſe Diſeaſes. Having thus emptied the bowels, you may make Revulſion by Friction, Cupping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by Vomit, if the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be in the neather Parts.</p>
                     <p>In your applications to the Part affected you are to conſider whether the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> was from an internal Cauſe, or external; alſo whether it be great, or little. If it ariſe from an external Cauſe, you may ſafely apply Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants without any preceding Evacuation, becauſe the Diſeaſe took its original meerly from the diſaffection of the Part, whether it was from the ſcorching heat of the Sun, ſharp Medicines, Contuſion, or Fracture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not from the peccancy of the Humours. Therefore in ſuch caſes you are obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the pain in the firſt place by lenient and cooling Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>If from an internal Cauſe, then evacuation by Purgatives is alwaies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, unleſs the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> be remote from the principal Parts, or that the heat affecting the Member be vehement; in which caſe you ſhall not inſiſt upon Evacuation, but apply the milder Refrigerants to contemperate the heat, and afterwards proceed in evacuation of the bilious Humours.</p>
                     <p>But if it be in the Head or Face,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> you are then to be cautious in your Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, (Abſtinence or a very ſlender Diet being the beſt remedy to begin with) and to forbear to treat the Parts affected till the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> have a while made its progreſs, and in ſome degree ſpent its heat. But if ſomething muſt be done to ſatisfie the Relations and By-ſtanders, let the Topick rather be of an exſiccant quality then repellent, leſt ſome ill accident enſue.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin with an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> proceeding from external Cauſes. The Medicaments generally preſcribed in ſuch caſes are of a cooling humecting quality, not too much aſtringent, leſt you dry the Skin, and prohibit Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, and the Humour included become ſharp, corroding the Parts, or ſtir up Apoſtemation. The Simples are, <hi>umbilicus Veneris, polygonum, plantag. trifolium paluſtre, portulac. pſyllium, ſempervivum, ſolanum.</hi> The Compounds are of various ſorts. ℞ <hi>ceruſſae</hi> ℥viij. <hi>lithargyr. auri</hi> ℥iv. <hi>mucilag. ſem. pſyllii, cydon. extract. in aq. ſolani, ſucci ſolani, umbilici Vener. an.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>aceti cochl.</hi> iv. <hi>ol. roſ. &amp; myritill. an.</hi>

                     <p>They who do uſe ſtronger Repellents ought to be carefull leſt,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> in repreſſing the Inflammation, they do extinguiſh the natural heat of the Part, or ſtrike the Humour inward upon the <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> proceeding from internal Cauſes <hi>decoctum ſalviae</hi> with a Solution of Caſtle-ſoap is a good Fomentation; and <hi>ceratum Galeni</hi> applied after it is ſufficient. In thoſe which are critical, a Cerote of <hi>ol. olivar. cum cera alba</hi> hath hitherto ſerved my purpoſe. If the heat be vehement, I renew the application daily; otherwiſe every other day ſufficeth: and as the Bliſters ariſe, I cut them, to prevent Eroſion. If afterwards they do excoriate, I dreſs them with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> or the following Unguent upon Pledgits of Lint, by which the ſerous Humour may be imbibed, and the Ulceration healed.

But, unleſs there be great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriation, it will be ſafer to leave the Cure of ſuch <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> to Nature, and evacuate and contemperate the heat by internal Medicaments. Nor ought we to be over-forward in our applications to the Face or parts about it: yet in my Practice I have commonly uſed <hi>aq. calcis</hi> with <hi>ol. lini</hi> well ſhaken together with good ſucceſs; as alſo theſe following, where I thought more Exſiccation neceſſary. Take diſtilled Vinegar in which hath been boiled a piece of <hi>Lithargyr.</hi> or <hi>minium:</hi> after it is ſettled, pour off the cleareſt of it, and filter it: put ſome of this into a glaſs, and adde <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> to it, and ſhake them together.

                     <p>The Accidents which attend <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> are the ſame as in a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Correction of Accidents.</note> and do happen through the unſeaſonable uſe of Repellents: therefore when you ſee the heat goe off, and the Skin relax, or when the Patient feeleth himſelf eaſed of that burning and pricking pain, forbear the uſe of your Repellents, and apply Reſolvents and Diſcutients, to corroborate the Part, and reſtore it to its natural tone. For though the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> do not ariſe with any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Tumour, yet in its progreſs the Member is ſwelled, and remains ſo after the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is breathed forth, and for want of Diſcuſſion doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently become oedematous.

                     <p>A Perſon of quality,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> labouring under ſome indiſpoſition of body and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a Fever, was by her Phyſicians advice let bloud about ℥viij. in the left Arm. The ſecond day after ſhe felt that Arm pained, but moſt about the Bend of it near where the Vein was opened. I looked upon her Arm, and ſaw it was ſpred with a burning heat of a paliſh yellow colour, mixed with red here and there: the Skin was tenſe and ſhining, alſo rimpled and bliſtered down from the Bend of the Arm to the Hand: from the Elbow to the Shoulder it was of an inflamed red colour. The whole Arm was ſwelled by the influx of the Humour. This <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> was thruſt forth by the ſtrength of nature, and poſſibly it might be invited thither by the Bandage. However it were, the Patient was relieved thereby; ſhe acknowledging her ſelf more affected with the pricking and burning heat in her Arm then any Sickneſs: yet ſhe was not without ſome Fever. I thought it not ſafe to be too buſie with Repellents in this caſe: for though I might thereby have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the increaſe, and cured it ſooner; yet her Fever might have been by that means augmented, and her Recovery hazarded, ſhe being then with Child. Therefore I reſolved to give way for the Humour to ſpend it ſelf by Tranſpiration: to which purpoſe I fomented with a <hi>decoct. ſalviae</hi> with Caſtle-ſoap diſſolved in it, and the while made a Cerote of <hi>ol. olivar.</hi> and Wax, and applied it in ſeveral pieces upon the Arm, with Bandage to retain it on; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95669:28"/>which her body was kept ſoluble Lenients, and a Pearl-Julep pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to refreſh her Spirits. Her Diet was Chicken-broth, Grewells, and the like. As the Bliſters aroſe, we ſnipt them, and to ſome of the biggeſt of them applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> upon Pledgits. During theſe Applications the heat went off from the Parts it had firſt affected, and ſpred up higher to the Breaſt and <hi>Scapula;</hi> it alſo affected the Hand and Fingers with Bliſters: but the tops of them being cut off, they healed, the Inflammation breathed forth in four or five days after, and ſhe recovered; but by reaſon of the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Arm was ſwelled. For the removall of which I directed them to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it with the Decoction preſcribed in the Method of Cure, by which, with the help of Bandage, it diſcuſſed. The roughneſs of the Skin was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cleared with <hi>Pomatum.</hi>

                     <p>A Youth about ſeven or eight years old,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> labouring under a complication of Diſeaſes from his Meſentery and Kidneys, was ordered by his Phyſician to have a Fontanell made in his left Arm: I made it, and left it well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. About ten days after that Arm was overſpred with an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> from the Shoulder to the Wriſt, here and there bliſtered. I threw out the Pea, and dreſt the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Praecipitate,</hi> then fomented the Arm with Milk, applying over it <hi>ceratum Galeni</hi> with Bandage. By this I deſigned to give tranſpiration to the Part whilſt the Phyſician did treat the Fever. The next day I renewed the Dreſſings in his preſence, and the Ulcer being ſomewhat digeſted, I put in a Pea by his advice, and dreſſed the Arm as before, thereby curing the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> in few days: but the Child remaining indiſpoſed, the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> burſt forth againg, and was alſo cured by the ſame method. Then the Patient was purged, and ſent into the Air near <hi>Barnet,</hi> where he drank thoſe Waters, and being thereby relieved, was brought back to his Parents. But within ſew days after he relapſed, and an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it ſelf again on the ſame Arm, with a ſmall <hi>Phlegmon</hi> below the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow on the outſide. It ſuppurated, and was opened by a Cauſtick, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to that Method. The <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> was alſo cured by the Cerote as before. After this the Child brake out of the Small-pox, and by the great endeavours of the Phyſicians was freed of that Diſeaſe; but languiſhed and died ſoon after. Upon the opening of his body, as Stone of the bigneſs and ſhape of an Almond was found in his left Ureter. We remembred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pain he had in his Back long before the firſt <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and thought that might be the occaſionall cauſe of all theſe Maladies; <hi>viz.</hi> the continuation of pain cauſed many reiterated Fevers and Fermentations in the bloud, of which theſe forementioned Diſeaſes were the effects. A thing not rare in Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to find the Small-pox produced by the pain of an Ulcer, as alſo to break out after the curing of them.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about ſixty years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> having laboured many years under an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> was ſeized with a pain in his left Side, and a Pleuriſie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, with great oppreſſion in his Lungs, his former accuſtomed way of diſcharge by expectoration being ſuppreſſed. Doctour <hi>Jaſper Nedham</hi> was ſent for. By his preſcription the Patient was let bloud ten ounces: <hi>Lohochs</hi> and Pectoralls, alſo opening Apozems, were preſcribed, and Venaeſection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; by which the Patient was relieved. Then a Fontanell was cut in his left Arm, which being digeſted, the Phyſician and Chirurgeon were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. A few days after the Patient relapſed, and an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> thruſt out the whole length of his Arm. I was fetch'd, and ſaw it ſwelled, the <hi>Cuticula</hi> veſicated, and ſhining with a burning heat of a citron colour from the Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell downward, but upward to the Shoulder it was more red. His Friends and himſelf thought the Inflammation to proceed through default of the Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95669:28"/>as not made in the right place. But that was an errour in them: for it was a tranſlation of part of that Humour which affected his Lungs, and was by the ſtrength of nature diſcharged upon this Part, to which the too ſtrict Bandage might poſſibly contribute; there being nothing more ordinary then ſuch diſcharges upon Fontanells: and it was well for him that it there disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd it ſelf. The Phyſician and my ſelf concluded it a pure <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and that it required to be breathed forth: to which purpoſe I applied a Cerote of Wax and Oyl over all the Arm, and put a leſſer Pea into the Fontanell, with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and <hi>Emplaſt. diachalcit.</hi> rowling up the Arm from the Hand to the Shoulder. The next day in dreſſing him I ſnipt the Bliſters, to let out the ſerous Humour, which might otherwiſe have ulcerated the Skin. The day after, obſerving the heat to go off, I put in a larger Pea, and dreſſed his Arm as I did the day before. In two or three days after, the Arm being as it were freed of the <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> I fixed the Fontanell, (which he keeps to this day:) but the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſpred to that <hi>Scapula</hi> and Clavicle, and ſo down to his Breaſt and Back. I dreſſed it with the ſame Cerote, and left him enough of it for his Servants to dreſs him with: during which Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were repeated, and he was cured by the application of the ſaid Cerote.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about ſixty four years of age, of a melancholick dry Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> was in the Winter-ſeaſon taken with a Quartan-ague, and after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Fit was ſeized with a pain in his left Leg, which increaſing, he ſent for me. The Leg was inflamed from the Knee to the Foot: the Inflammation of the Skin was of a more deep red colour then is uſually ſeen in a true <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> it indeed partaking ſomewhat of a <hi>Phlegmon;</hi> but the Swelling was without circumſcription; it was tenſe and ſhining, made by a Tranſlation of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: ſo that by this, if well managed, he was in a poſſibility of being freed of that. Therefore I propoſed by Lenients to moderate the heat, and breath out the Humour. Having ſatisfied him, that it was neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed deliberately with it, I treated it as in the former Obſervation hath been ſaid, and dreſſed it twice or thrice with the ſaid Cerote; and, having aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the heat and pain in it, I ſhewed his Servants how to dreſs it, and gave directions to the Patient in the regulation of his Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and took my leave; adviſing them not to dreſs it too often, leſt upon ſo doing the Inflammation ſhould go off before the morbifick Matter were ſpent. From the time the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation was made in his Leg he had no more Fits of his Ague, and his Leg became well without the application of other Medicaments. Upon the going off of the Inflammation I made him a Fontanell in that Leg, which he continueth ſtill.</p>

The night after he was ſeized with a pain in his right Leg from his Knee to his Toes, with great Inflammation. For the appeaſing of which a Fomentation was brought him by ſome Pretender in Chirurgery, and applied with courſe woollen Stupes; one of which was bound upon his Leg. This Leg growing from that time more painfull, I was fetch'd to him; when, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Stupes, I found the Leg exceedingly inflamed and bliſtered, ſo that the Stupe ſticking in the Sores had excoriated the Part with great pain and Fluxion, which drew after it a ſmall <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> There was in this Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent great need of making a Revulſion from his Head; but this was by wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Stupes was of too much danger to be continued. I wanted a Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cleanſe and refreſh the Part, and, being in haſte, cauſed ſome water to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95669:29"/>be heated, with a handfull of Wheat-bran: which being ſtrained, I bathed the Member with a Sponge; then applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> upon Pledgits of Lint on the Excoriations, and a Cerote of Wax and Oyl over the Leg, and an anodyne Cataplaſm on the Tubercle. Theſe Dreſſings were renewed daily, till the Accidents were diminiſhed, and the Tumour ſuppurated. Then I gave a vent to the Matter, and proceeding by Digeſtion, made no haſte in the Cure, but expected rather that the <hi>Plethora</hi> ſhould be carried off the while by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and the Patient relieved in his Head. The Phyſicians were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, affirming that it would be time enough when his Leg ſhould be cured. I was therefore obliged to haſten: however I made him a couple of Iſſues <hi>inter Scapulas;</hi> and having well-near cured that Tubercle in his Ham, I left a Pea in it to keep it open as a Fontanel. Though that Leg was not ſo fit for it, by reaſon of the great Inflammation it had laboured under; yet I thought all little enough for Derivation, and would gladly have continued the Leg more ſore: but I obeyed my order, and left him cured of his Leg.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about fourty years of age,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> of a full Body, was taken with Rigour and Fever. After ſome days ſhe complained of a pain in her left Shoulder, and a pricking heat in that Arm. I was ſent for, and perceived it to be an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> thruſting out: wherefore thinking ſhe might be much relieved thereby, I diſſwaded her from applying any thing to it. But the heat and pain increaſing, ſhe was adviſed to apply ſome cooling Ointment to it, which was thought excellent for Inflammations. She permitted it; and it did indeed check the Inflammation, but her Fever increaſed, with a <hi>Delirium.</hi> She was let bloud, cupp'd and bliſtered, and all things were done to draw back the Matter; but ſhe died.</p>

I alſo directed a Clyſter to be given him that night, and a Cordial Julep upon occaſin. In the morning he was hot, and had reſted ill, and the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> was ſpred to his Neck, and affected his left Ear with great pain, and reached up to his Forehead amongſt the Hair. I let him bloud again, and adviſed him to keep his bed, and put himſelf into a Sweat with a draught of Poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink wherein had been boiled a little Harts-horn, a few opening Roots and Marigold-flowers. I alſo ſent him a glaſs of <hi>aqua calcis</hi> with <hi>ol. lini</hi> beat in it, with direction to anoint his Face with a feather, it being very much heated and ſwelled: he was alſo purged with Lenients, ſome of thoſe which have been ſet down in the method of Cure. By this method the <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> went quite off in 10 or 12 days. Then I bathed it with <hi>decoct. malvae, viol.</hi> &amp;c. to bring off the Scurf, and afterwards with Butter-milk, to ſupple it, and anointed his face with <hi>Pomatum.</hi>

I let him bloud in the Arm, and purged him with Lenients; all things elſe were done for Revulſion: but, by reaſon of his Hair, there were no applications made to relieve the Part affected; whereupon a Suppuration followed; which put me upon a neceſſity of cutting it off, and applying Fomentations diſcutient and drying.

The <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſhifted from one part to another in and about his Face. They applied no Medicaments to the Parts diſeaſed. In the declination of it I ſaw it ariſe again freſh in his Forehead with a Swelling very high, onely from the ſtreightneſs of his Cap: which I taking notice of, and adviſing it to be ſlackned, the Swelling ſunk again few hours. I inſtance this onely to ſhew how ſmall a thing will raiſe this diſturbance where the bilious Humours are in ferment. As his <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſpent it ſelf, they purged him, and he recovered. An <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> ſometime affecting one particular part of the Head or Face, as the Eye, Noſe or Ear, hath given mech trouble to the Phyſician and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in removing it.</p>
                     <p>It is not many days ſince I was called to one labouring of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> on his right Ear. It had been diſeaſed four or five days before I came:<note place="margin">10. Obſervat.</note> it was prodigiouſly ſwelled and inflamed; and, by reaſon of the acrimony of the Humour which was included between the Folds of the Ear and the Ear and Scalp, there was great Excoriation. I fomented it with <hi>decoct. ſalviae cum ſapone,</hi> dreſſed it with that Preparation of <hi>acet. litharg. cum ol. roſ.</hi> above propoſed in the method of Cure, and left her ſome of it to dreſs her ſelf as occaſion ſhould offer; then let her bloud, and directed a Clyſter to be given her. The next day I purged her with Whey and Manna, and repeated it again and again. She lived a few miles out of Town, which put me upon the neceſſity of committing the Cure of it to themſelves, with Directions, and Medicaments ſuch as I have above propoſed. It dried up the external heat; but the Fluxion, which lay more internally, after all apoſtemated, and was cured accordingly.</p>
                     <p>I was called in by my kind neighbour Doctour <hi>Denton</hi> to a young Woman who had been afflicted with an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> which had ſpred over all her Face:<note place="margin">11. Obſervat.</note> it had ſhifted often: at length ſhe was cured thereof by the ſaid Phyſician; yet was the right Eye cloſed with the Inflammation and Swelling from the reliques of that <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and the lower Lid apoſtemated, and the Matter was ready to make its way inwardly into the hollow of the Eye. We opened it by Inciſion, diſcharging a proportionable quantity of Matter; the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of which we digeſted and cleanſed to a perfect Cicatrice by <hi>unguent. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompholygos,</hi> diſcuſſing the Tumour in the mean while by Fomentations.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of a Furuncle or Boil.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>runculus</hi> is a painfull Tubercle of the bigneſs of a Pigeon's Egg,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> with a broad <hi>baſis,</hi> ariſing in a Cone. It is generally called a <hi>Boil,</hi> and in its ſtate is accompanied with Inflammatio, Pulſation, and Tenſion.</p>
                     <p>It proceedeth from a groſs vicious bloud ſeparated from the reſt a unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and is caſt forth by the ſtrength of nature into the externall parts of the body.</p>
                     <p>It differeth as it is greater or leſs,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> and as it affects the Skin or lies deeper in the Fleſh: it is alſo accounted malign, or benign. Thoſe that are more deep partake of the nature of a Carbuncle, and are miſtaken for ſuch, but are not of ſo aduſt or corrupt an Humour. <hi>Furunculus</hi> differeth alſo from a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, in that this cometh to Suppuration, which the other never doth.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Furuncle</hi> is in its beginning round,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> hard, and inflamed; and as it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it riſeth up with an acute head, and ſometimes a Puſtule: and then it is more inflamed and painfull, (whence ariſeth that expreſſion, <hi>As ſore as a Boil,</hi>) eſpecially when it arrives at its ſtate, which is about the eighth or ninth day. If the Boil be malign, it is of a black dusky colour: there is alſo a Fever and other untoward Symptoms, and a thin <hi>Sanies</hi> iſſueth from it; and if it doth digeſt, it is with much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boils</hi> are for the moſt part without danger.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick</note> The common ſort do predict Health, and frequently cure though nothing be applied to them; for they come to maturity and break of their own accord. But when they ariſe in ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts of the Arms or Legs, they affect the neighbouring Emunctory. In the Noſe or Ears they are very painfull, and vexatious to cure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> conſiſts in the regulation of Diet and in Evacuation,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> like as in a <hi>Phlegmon;</hi> onely the Applications in theſe ought to be maturative, they always terminating in Matter, and being, as you may perceive by the toughneſs of the Matter, not capable of Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>The Maturatives are, <hi>rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, malvae, rad. lilior. uvae paſſae, ficus,</hi> and all the emollient Gums, <hi>galbanum. ammoniac.</hi> &amp;c. The Compounds are, Empl. diachyl. cum gummi, de meliloto, tripharmacon, de mucilaginibus. In the extremity of pain you may aſſwage the heat with this or ſuch like: ℞ <hi>muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. ſem. pſyllii, altaeae, lini, an.</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>far. hordei</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ol. llior. axung. gallinae, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>butyri recent.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>croci</hi> ℈j. <hi>cum vitell. ovi fiat Cataplaſma.</hi> When the Tumour is broken, deterge that tough Matter with <hi>mundif. ex apio,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this or ſuch like Cerote over the Tumour; ℞ <hi>ſevi cervini &amp; vitulini an.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>axung. anſeris</hi> ℥j. <hi>terebinth.</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>cerae q. ſ. fiat Ceratum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN a Man of about fifty years of age,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> of a healthy ſtrong Body, journeying to <hi>London,</hi> a Boil roſe upon his Wriſt. He applied to it an Emplaſter of Shoemakers-wax. When he came to me it was hard and inflamed. I dreſſed it with the aboveſaid Cataplaſm, by which it ſuppurated. As the Puſtule fretted off, a hot <hi>Sanies</hi> iſſued forth in a ſmall quantity. I dreſſed the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum vitell. ovi</hi> upon a Pledgit, and continued the application of the Cataplaſm over all. The next day I took off the Dreſſings, and found the <hi>Cuticula</hi> caſt off, and the acute end of the Boil red, and a thick
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95669:30"/>white Matter ſticking in it. I dreſſed it as before, and the ſecond day after again, and ſaw the Cone or head of the Boil broken off, and that thick tough Matter lying in it; which Matter likewiſe appeared round about through the ſeverall Eruptions it had made. I dreſſed it with <hi>mundif. ex apio,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Cerote <hi>Sevi cervini</hi> over it. The ſecond day after I found the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penings broke one into another, and the tough Matter ſticking in them as in a Honey-comb. At that time the Ulcer was near as broad as a Half-crown. I continued the Mundificative and Cerote, and dreſſed it every other day. As this tough Matter digeſted out, it incarned underneath, and contracted, and healed as faſt, and cicatrized by the application of <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> leaving lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Scar, and no hardneſs, behind it.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince I was ſent for early one morning to a Gentleman about fourty years of age,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> who was extremely pained with a Boil on th out-ſide of his left Thigh. I pulled off the Emplaſter, which was of <hi>galbanum,</hi> and ſaw the Boil was in its ſtate, and ready to break. It was much inflamed, and the Puſtule was of a livid colour. I dreſſed the Puſtule with <hi>ol. roſ. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> and applied over the inflamed Boil an Emplaſter of <hi>bailicon.</hi> I returned that night, and dreſſed it with the Cataplaſm above preſcribed, by which it ſuppurated, the <hi>Cuticula</hi> brake off, and a thin <hi>Sanies</hi> with ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Matter diſcharged. As the Boil came more to maturity, the Puſtule or head brake off, and made way for the Matter to digeſt out: and accordingly the Ulcer cured. An Empirick, angry that his Medicaments were thrown off, and mine applied, complained to a Perſon of Honour, whoſe Family I then attended, that this Gentleman laboured under a Carbuncle or Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but I cleared my ſelf to that Perſon, and ſhall ſhew you in its proper place, that a Carbuncle is another kind of Boil.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman near ſeventy years old was ſorely afflicted with a <hi>Furuncle</hi> within his Noſtrills, and about his Noſe with great Inflammation and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> I fomented the diſeaſed Parts with <hi>decoct. ſummitat. althaeae, malvae, viol. flor. chamaem. meliloti, ſem. lini &amp; pſyllii,</hi> and with a Syringe injected ſome of the ſame liquour into his Noſtrills, and applied the forementioned Cataplaſm over his Noſe. I purpoſe the letting him bloud in the Arm, but it would not be admitted by reaſon of his age: but by ſetting on Leeches behind his Ears I took away ſome bloud; alſo by bliſtering the Neck and Shoulders I endeavoured Revulſion, by Clyſters kept his body ſoluble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Applications, by which his pain was ſomewhat mitigated. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter five or ſix days the Skin became thin, and a white Matter ſhewed it ſelf in ſeverall places within and about his Noſe, and gradually made its way through many ſmall Openings. I made it more way here and there with the point of a Lancet, and dreſſed them <hi>cum vitell. ovi &amp; ol. lilior.</hi> and continued the uſe of the Fomentation, and applied the Cerote. I was much troubled to think what would become of his Noſe, the exteriour and interiour parts being all ſtuft with that clammy Matter, ſo that it would not iſſue out; and, when it ſhould, I doubted it would leave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coverture for the Cartilagues. To haſten it out, I daily dropt in a mixture of <hi>mel roſ. cum ſucco apii</hi> decocted; and by conveying a big Tent dipt in the ſame into each Noſtrill, I preſt the Matter outward, and ſometimes pull'd it away with my <hi>Forceps.</hi> It came out as if it had been broken pieces of the <hi>Spinalis medulla,</hi> and burſt ſome of the Openings into one another; which I was ſorry to ſee. But the Matter not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with acrimony, the hollowneſs filled up, and the diſtended Lips, falling near one another, agglutinated as the Matter digeſted out:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95669:31"/>and by the Compreſſion I made with my Tents within the Noſtrills I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged them, and furthered the well cicatrizing of the Ulcer; which was effected in few days after with <hi>Cicatrices</hi> not unſeemly.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of</hi> Epinyctis <hi>and</hi> Terminthus.</head>
                     <p>THere are yet two ſorts of painfull Tubercles which I have met with in my Practice: they are taken notice of by the Ancients under the names of <hi>Epinyctis</hi> and <hi>Terminthus;</hi> a couple of angry Puſtules, affecting the Skin in the Arms, Hands and Thighs. They do not differ much one from another, ſo may well be entred together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epinyctis</hi> is of the bigneſs of a Lupin,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> of a dusky red, and ſometimes of a livid and pale colour, with great Inflammation and pain. It diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth firſt a <hi>Sanies,</hi> then a bloudy Matter. <hi>Terminthus</hi> is ſomewhat leſs, of a blackiſh colour: it breaks and gleets, and within a day or two the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule ſeparates, and comes away in a Slough, and from that time it digeſts and heals.</p>
                     <p>They both proceed from an exceſſive heat in the Bloud,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> but are without malignity or danger, and cure with little difficulty, if there be no errour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Chirurgery.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> conſiſts in Evacuation by Bleeding,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> Purging, and regulation in Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The externall Applications commended to us by the Ancients are, <hi>fol. cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, ſolan. plantag. cum polenta;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>uvas paſſas mundatas, &amp; contuſas ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone:</hi> and to waſh them with <hi>aqua ſalita,</hi> to dry up the Matter, and prevent Eroſion; afterwards to dreſs them with a mixture of equall parts of <hi>ſulphur viv.</hi> and <hi>ſpum. argenti cum vino.</hi> I never was conſulted in theſe till they were arrived at their height, and then found Anodynes of moſt uſe, and applied ſuch as have been preſcribed in the former Chapter, and afterwards healed them with <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Maid came recommended to me with the former of theſe Tubercles on the inſide of her Arm of the bigneſs of the greater ſort of Lupins,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyctis.</hi>
                        </note> of a livid colour, with a ſmall acute Puſtule riſing up in the middle of it. It was accompanied with great Inflammation, affecting the Tendons with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Joynt. I preſcribed her that Cataplaſm <hi>ex mucilag. ſem. pſyllii, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeae, lini,</hi> &amp;c. as in the Chapter of <hi>Furuncle,</hi> and embrocated the Tendons affected with <hi>ol. roſ. &amp; cham.</hi> By this the Tubercle was brought near Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Puſtule firſt brake, and diſcharged a thin <hi>Sanies.</hi> I dreſſed it <hi>cum vitello ovi,</hi> and about two days after the Tubercle it ſelf thruſt out a bloudy Matter. I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> added to the <hi>vitell. ovi,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>cerat. dialthaeae,</hi> and continued the Embrocation. The Matter from that time was daily better digeſted, and the pain diminiſhed: it was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and <hi>Empl. è bolo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman having ſuch another on the outſide of his Wriſt was recommended to ſome body who opened it by Inciſion:<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyctis.</hi>
                        </note> but from that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95669:31"/>time it became more exceeding painfull. He came to me with it hard and dry, and it had communicated its Anguiſh all along by the Tendons and Nerves to that <hi>Axilla</hi> with ſeveral Glands. I embrocated the Arm from the <hi>Axilla</hi> to the Knuckles of that Hand with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> upon thoſe Glands. To the Tubercle I applied <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. roſ.</hi> ſpred indifferent thick in the form of an Emplaſter, and dreſſed it ſo twice a day. I purpoſed the next morning to have let him bloud; but he was eaſier: and the ſame night I felt the Tubercle ſofter, and ſaw a bloudy Matter thruſt out. From that time it digeſted better, and the Accidents diminiſhed: in four or five days after the Glands reſolved, and the Ulcer cured by the application of <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Of the latter ſort there aroſe one in the Knuckle leading to the Fore-finger of a Gentlewoman of about fourty years of age.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a <hi>Termin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</hi>
                        </note> An old acquaintance of mine called me to the ſight of it. It was a ſmall Tubercle inflamed round its <hi>baſis,</hi> having a black head, and a long inflamed Streak paſſing from it to a Fontanel which ſhe had on that Arm. Whether it did run upward from the Puſtule to the Fontanel, and affect it, or deſcend from it to the Puſtule, I know not: however it was, there were marks of communication from one to the other, and both were painfull, and the Patient was indiſpoſed with a Fever. In the Fontanel there was a ſmall Orenge-pea, which I caſt out, and put in a common one, and dreſſed it with Lenients, and an Emplaſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them on. I dreſſed the Puſtule with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> and applied the forementioned Cerote preſcribed in <hi>Furuncle.</hi> It ſuppurated the next day, and the head of it caſt off in a Slough. I clipped off the looſe skin from it, and dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and in five or ſix days cicatrized it. During the Cure the Patient was afflicted with a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> which was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged off. After which ſhe was hot and feveriſh, and troubled with a <hi>Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmus;</hi> for which ſhe was let bloud, and cured.</p>

                     <p>UNder this Head I comprehend all thoſe Tumours of the Glandules which have Bloud for their eſſential ingredient. They are uſually reckon'd <hi>Phyma, Phygethlon, Bubo, Parotis.</hi> It is true that <hi>Strumae</hi> and <hi>Scrofulae</hi> do ſometimes partake of Bloud and become <hi>Phlegmonoide,</hi> &amp;c. but that is not eſſential to them: witneſs the great numbers that never come to inflame or ſuppurate.</p>
                     <p>OF thoſe that are eſſentially bloudy Tumours,<note place="margin">Phyma.</note> though few of them pure <hi>Phlegmons, PHYMA</hi> is the firſt;<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> which is an Inflammation affecting the Glandules under the Jaws. I mean the conglobate Glands: <hi>viz.</hi> neither the internal ſalivary, which is <hi>Ranula;</hi> nor the external, which is <hi>Parotis.</hi> The name of <hi>Phyma</hi> is alſo given to the <hi>Phlegmonoïde</hi> Tumours in and about the <hi>Anus,</hi> becauſe of their near reſemblance to glandulous Tumours, if they be not really ſuch.</p>
                     <p>They are cauſed by a mixture of impure Bloud with <hi>Pituita.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> Children are moſt ſubject to them; and in them they are haſtned by their wearing of Stays, a way to keep their Head-cloaths on.</p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95669:32"/>
                     <p>The Tumour is round and hard;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> in time of Suppuration it inflames, and is accompanied with Pulſation, Tenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> but doth ſooner ſuppurate.</p>
                     <p>They have been taken by ſome for <hi>Strumae:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Difference.</note> but they differ from a <hi>Struma,</hi> which, being contained in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> doth require to be eradicated by Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks after Suppuration and diſcharge of its Matter; but theſe after diſcharge of Matter are cured either of themſelves, or by the ordinary intenſions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are without danger, and eaſie of Cure.</p>
                     <p>The method of <hi>Cure</hi> is the ſame with that of the little <hi>Phlegmon:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> onely theſe do not admit of Repellents; but from their very beginning muſt either be diſcuſſed, or brought to ſuppurate. And indeed all that I have ever ſeen did terminate by Suppuration. In the beginning we treat them with <hi>Empl. diachyl. cum gummi, de meliloto,</hi> and the like: or, in caſe of pain, with matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Cataplaſms, as hath been ſet down in <hi>Phlegmon</hi> and <hi>Furunculus;</hi> as <hi>rad. althaeae, lilior. ſem. lini, pſyllii,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman fetch'd me one night from my houſe to ſee his onely Child,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> about a year old, labouring of one of thoſe Tumours under the right Jaw: it was round and hard, of a pale colour, and was ſuppoſed the <hi>King's Evil.</hi> I applied <hi>Empl. diachyl. cum gummi,</hi> and, in ſtead of the Stay, put on a folded linen cloath about it, to retain the Dreſſing. After three or four days I viſited the Child again, and ſaw the Tumour red, tending to Suppuration. I then dreſſed with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and a Plaiſter; and the third day after, feeling the Tumour well ſuppurated, opened it by the milder Cauſtick, and diſcharged a Matter of good colour and conſiſtence. I dreſſed it with Lenients, and after ſeparation of the Eſcar diſpoſed it to incarn by the common Sarcoticks, and by the uſe of the Vitriol-ſtone; and afterwards with <hi>unguent. de lithargyro</hi> cured it in few days.</p>
                     <p>Such another,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> but bigger, was that in a Girl of about nine years old, where Doctour <hi>Rugely</hi> was the Phyſician. She had been diſeaſed with a Fever, and ſome Reliques of that Matter diſcharged themſelves in a Swelling under the right Jaw as big as a Pullet's egg. It was ſuppurated, and required vent, which I gave it by Inciſion; but could not cure it till I had applied a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick upon the depending part. The place not being very capable of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, it could not be treated ſo advantageouſly when opened by Inciſion, and dreſſed with Tents: but after the laying it more open by Cauſtick, the Matter plentifully diſcharged, and the Abſceſs cured as the former. Many of theſe have been brought to me upon ſuſpicion of the <hi>King's Evil:</hi> ſome of which my Servants have cured by my directions after the aboveſaid manner. You will meet with more of this Tumour in the Treatiſe of the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Podex.</hi>

                        </note> and is called <hi>Panus.</hi> It differeth from <hi>Phyma,</hi> in that it hath a mixture with <hi>Bilis,</hi> as the other had with <hi>Pituita,</hi> and lies round and flat as a Cake under the Jaws.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> She had a flat, hard, round Tumour lying under her Chin and part of the right Jaw down towards her Throat: it was of a yellowiſh red colour, not unlike
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95669:32"/>that in an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> but without Veſication. I directed one of my Servants to make a Cataplaſm <hi>ex rad. lilior. alb.</hi> &amp;c. by the application of which it ſuppurated in three or four days, and diſcharged a well-digeſted Matter; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which the hardneſs reſolved, and it cured in ſeven days by the onely uſe of that Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>THE Tumour called <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BO</hi> is an Inflammation of the Glandules in the Emunctories of the Groin or Arm-pit.<note place="margin">Bubo.</note>

                     <p>A Fontanel in the Leg diſtempered with pain cauſed a ſwelling of the Glands <hi>in Inguine.</hi> I was conſulted about the Swelling, and,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> enquiring of the reaſon of the ſudden Tumour, found the Fontanel diſturbed by walking much that day.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Buboes</hi> that are neither malign nor contagious are not dangerous,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> if they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate kindly, and are timely opened: but if the contrary happen, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into <hi>Fiſtulae,</hi> and then are not without danger.

                     <p>A <hi>Bubo,</hi> according to the uſual method of Practice,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: therefore in order to the Cure you are to conſider the Cauſe; and if it were by <hi>Criſis,</hi> you are either to breath it forth by Diſcutients, or haſten Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation.

But if it will come to Suppuration, you ſhall haſten the Opening of it, and digeſt, incarn and cicatrize it, as is ſaid in the general Chapter of <hi>Abſceſſes,</hi> and will be ſhewed in the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about fifty years old,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> of a full Body and ſtrong Conſtitution, was taken with a pain under his right Arm with hardneſs and Inflammation. I was ſent for, and, concluding it a <hi>Bubo;</hi> thruſt forth by the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, applied <hi>Empl. diachyl. cum gummi,</hi> deſigning not to dreſs it again till it was near ſuppurated: but the Tumour increaſing with great pain and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med redneſs, I was put upon a neceſſity of applying anodyne Cataplaſms. Within few days after, it being ſuppurated, I opened it by Inciſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a well-concocted Matter: then dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon cum vitell. ovi</hi> upon a Tent, and applied an <hi>Empl. diachyl. ſimpl.</hi> malaxed with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. dialthaeae,</hi> and afterwards dreſſed it with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> Having ſo diſpoſed it to heal, I left Dreſſings, and after three or four days viſited the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient again: when, obſerving the hardneſs digeſted off, and the Abſceſs fit to cicatrize, I left off the uſe of the Tent, and dreſſed it with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> and the Cerote over it, and left them wherewithall to finiſh the Cure. But a few days after they ſent for me again. I found it ſwelled, and the Matter iſſuing from it thin and foetid, much more in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity then I could expect. I enlarged the Opening by Inciſion, and there came forth a Tent which in his Servants Dreſſing had ſlipt into the Abſceſs. From that time the Matter leſſened, and the Abſceſs cured without relapſe by the method aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>A married Wife,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> of about thirty four years of age, having been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed with Hyſtericall Fits, with a complication of other Maladies, after many unſucceſsfull attempts, was put into the hands of Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> who preſcribed <hi>Merc. dulc.</hi> ℈j. <hi>in conſ. cichorii.</hi> The ſecond Doſe ſalivated her ſixteen or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, whereby ſhe was relieved for ſome moneths: but then ſhe complained of a pain in her left Groin, which growing bigger, and raiſing the Parts about it into a Tumour, ſhe embrocated it by my advice with <hi>ol. lumbric.</hi> After a few days, the Tumour more increaſing with Inflammation and hardneſs, I applied <hi>Emplaſt. mucilag.</hi> with a third part of <hi>Emplaſt. diachyl. cum gummi.</hi> The fourth day after, feeling the Tumour ſuppurated, I opened it by a Cauſtick, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a proportionable quantity of Matter well digeſted; then dreſſed it with Lenients, to haſten the ſeparation of the Eſcar. While the Eſcar was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, a long Streak of red appeared ſtretching down from the <hi>Inguen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the middle of the Thigh toward the Ham. I embrocated it with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and applied <hi>cerat. Galeni.</hi> The next day I felt Matter in it, and ſaw the inflamed Streak ſtretch lower down. I applied a little of my milder Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick upon the upper part of it, which was about three fingers breadth from the Tumour <hi>in Inguine,</hi> and gave vent to a little digeſted Matter, dreſſing it with Lenients. This while the Abſceſs in the Groin was in good temper, and diſpoſed to heal: but the aforeſaid inflamed Streak paſſed down to the Ham, and ſo along the <hi>Muſculus gaſtrocnemius</hi> to the great Tendon of it which leads to the Heel, and had Matter in it the whole length. In leſs ſpace then four days I made Apertions in it in five ſeverall places, all by Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; the lowermoſt in the lower part of the Calf of the leg. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Matter, and were cured in few days (after the Eſcars were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated) by the uſe of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95669:33"/>
                     <p>After ſome moneths ſhe was ſeized with Convulſive twitches, which ſhe obſerved to ariſe from the lower part of the Calf of the leg that had been affected with the Apoſtemations, and in the ſame place where the Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore terminated. Upon which conſideration the Phyſician preſcribed a Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell to be made in the very Part; which accordingly I made, and kept open by a Pea, with an Emplaſter and laced Stocking: by which means ſhe was freed of her Fits, and enjoyed a tolerable meaſure of health a long time after.</p>
                     <p>So a Lady labouring under ſuch like Fits, which began on the out-ſide of the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> near the Shin, was cured by making a Fontanell in that place, when other Remedies failed. She continueth it to this day, I ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>In another we made a Fontanell between the Thumb and Fore-finger; and in another in the Breaſt; and in a Child behind the Ear: thoſe Fits begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PAROTIS</hi> is a Tumour in the Glandules behind and about the Ears,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Parotis.</hi> Deſcription.</note> generally called the Emunctories of the Brain; though indeed they are the externall Fountains of the <hi>Saliva</hi> of the Mouth, as modern Authours do agree.</p>
                     <p>The immediate <hi>Cauſe</hi> is the Bloud offending in quantity or quality,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> as it hath admixture with the Ferment of the Part, or with other Humours. It alſo happeneth by an externall Cauſe, as Bruiſe or Wound, whereby bloud is extravaſated, and caſt out into theſe Glands behind the Ear on one ſide or other, making a Parotid Tumour.</p>
                     <p>They differ according to the Humour, and manner of generation.<note place="margin">Difference.</note> To the Humour; as whether the Bloud be mixed with Choler, Phlegm, or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. To the manner of generation; and ſo a <hi>Parotis</hi> is a Symptom of a Fever, or a <hi>Criſis</hi> of it. Thoſe Fevers be uſually malignant that caſt out ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: but ſometimes a <hi>Parotis</hi> riſeth ſimply.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parotis</hi> is known by the Part it affects with Tumour,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> Pain and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, as having generally a great proportion of bloud mixed with other Humours, according as they are predominant. If it be malign or peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, there is Fever joyned with it. Whether it proceeded ſymptomatically or critically, the time of the Diſeaſe and Signs may demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Parotis</hi> without a Fever is leſs malign or dangerous then that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with one. They are alſo leſs dangerous which attend long Fevers,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> then thoſe which follow acute ones. Thoſe which are thruſt forth by a <hi>Criſis</hi> are ſalutary and eaſily cured: but thoſe which happen after great Evacuations, or Fever, without remiſſion of it, are pernicious and dangerous. Thoſe which break forth ſymptomatically, and ariſe from vicious ill-diſpoſed Humours, are of difficult Cure, and dangerous.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Tumour,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> you are to conſider whether it be ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, or criticall, or of what kind of Matter generated.</p>
                     <p>If it be criticall, and come out kindly, the buſineſs is then by Lenients to mitigate the pain, and further Suppuration; as hath been ſaid before in <hi>Bubo.</hi> But whether it be ſymptomaticall or criticall, with little or much Tumour, malign or benign, you ought not to uſe Repellents, leſt thereby you return the Matter from without inward. If the Inflammation be great, and the Accidents high, and Bloud abound, let it out, evacuating the Humour by lenient Purgatives, regulating the Patient's Diet, contemperating the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours as in <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and embrocating with <hi>ol. lumbric. chamaem.</hi> &amp;c. But if through any defect nature do not thruſt the Tumour out as you would, you may further it by Cupping-glaſſes and Attractives, as in <hi>Bubo</hi> hath been
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95669:34"/>ſaid. Or if the Matter be crude and viſcid, you may apply powerfull Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and with Emollients if you fear induration. But if after all it tend to Suppuration, then further it with Suppuratives; as, ℞ <hi>rad, lilior. cepar. ſub cineribus coctar. an.</hi> ℥iv. <hi>mucilag. ſem. lini,</hi> ℥jſs <hi>far. tritic.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>axung. proci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, unguent. baſilic. an.</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>vitell. ovor.</hi> ij <hi>croci</hi> ℈ij. <hi>fiat Cataplaſma.</hi> The Matter concocted, you are to give it vent, and proceed in the Cure, as hath been ſaid in the former Chapter of <hi>Bubo.</hi>

                     <p>A Child aged about three years,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> by accident of a Fall, was ſeized with a Dizzineſs and ſome twitches of a Convulſion. A Fontanell was made in the Neck, and a Veſicatory applied <hi>inter Scapulas:</hi> but the Child was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much relieved. A Tumour afterwards thruſt out behind that Ear. I made a Fontanell under it, and derived the Matter thither, and thereby the Child recovered.</p>
                     <p>In Concuſſions and Fractures of the <hi>Cranium</hi> theſe Tumours are frequent, and are diſcuſſed by. <hi>ol. cham.</hi> &amp;c. or the Matter may, as hath been ſaid, by a Fontanell there-under be happily ſpent.</p>
                     <p>The perſpiration in theſe Parts is to be regarded; for the checking of it hath cauſed Convulſions, yea Death, in little Infants.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged about thirty years,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> of a ſtrong healthfull Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was taken one night with a pain behind her right Ear; it increaſed, and became very troubleſome. After three of four days ſhe ſent for me. The pain affected the Temporall Muſcle with heat and Tumour, and her Head with Twitchings and frequent Startings. She kept her bed, and was faint and weak; ſhe had neither purged nor bled. I felt her Pulſe ſmall, which I judged to be rather from oppreſſion then weakneſs, there being no confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cauſe for the latter. I perſwaded her to be let bloud, which with ſome unwillingneſs ſhe yielded to. I opened a Vein in her right Arm: the bloud flowing out in a full ſtream, and being ſerous, I took away ten ounces; then embrocated the Tumour with <hi>ol. cham.</hi> warm, and dipt Wooll in it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it upon the Part affected. A Clyſtes was given her ſome hours after, and an Emulſion preſcribed her, of which ſhe drank a good draught that night, and repeated it at pleaſure. The pain continuing, a Cataplaſm was applied <hi>ex rad. lilior. fol. malvae, violar. flor. cham. ſem. foenug.</hi> made up with a few crums of White-bread, Saffron, Yolk of an egg, and <hi>ol. ſambuci;</hi> the Parts being firſt fomented with ſome of the Decoction, and part of the Liquour caſt in with a Syringe; Wooll alſo was dipt in the ſame, and put into the Ear. By theſe Applications an Apoſtemation diſcharged it ſelf thereout; yet the Tumour did not much ſlacken. Therefore I purged her with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>ſena, rhabarb.</hi> &amp;c. in which was diffolved Manna, and <hi>ſyr. roſ. pallid.</hi> whereby ſhe was ſomewhat relieved. A day or two after I purged her with Whey, Manna, and <hi>Crem. tartar.</hi> and afterward repeated it: the Tumour the while diſcuſſed, her <hi>Menſes</hi> came down, and ſhe recovered.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to a Child of about two years of age diſeaſed with a large Tumour of an ovall figure,<note place="margin">3.

I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocated the Tumour with <hi>ol. lilior. &amp; cham.</hi> and directed a Cataplaſm to be applied of a few <hi>malvae &amp; viol.</hi> with the Crums of a White loaf boiled in Milk. and made up with <hi>axung. porcin.</hi> Yolk of an egg, and a little Saffron. And the day after, calling there again, and ſeeing the Tumour hard, I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Lilly-root to be roaſted under embers, and beat up with the remaining Cataplaſm: by which in two or three days it ſuppurated. I opened it by Cauſtick, and diſcharged a well-concocted Matter, and in few days after cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it by Digeſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Amongſt the many diſeaſed people that came to me at the publick Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>November</hi> 1673.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> there was a Child of about two years of age diſeaſed with a hard inflamed Tumour lying round behind the left Ear. I directed one of my Servants to apply an <hi>Emplaſt. diachyl. cum gummi</hi> malaxed with <hi>unguent. dialthaeae:</hi> and the fourth day after, feeling it ſuppurated, we ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by a Cauſtick about half an inch long in the declining Part, and gave vent to a well-concocted Matter. From that time it was dreſſed with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. baſilic.</hi> in the form of a Cerote. Thus the hardneſs was reſolved, and, as the Matter diſcharged, the Abſceſs healed within in few days with little or no pain or trouble: whereas if it had been opened by Inciſion, it muſt have been kept open by a Tent, and been rendred more painfull and ſlow of Cure. After the Eſcar ſeparated, a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. diapompholygos</hi> and a touch ſometimes of the Vitriol-ſtone deterged, incarned, and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized it.</p>
                     <p>An old Gentleman, a Servant to the King below ſtairs, brought his Son to me,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> an infirm Youth of about thirteen years of age, having a large Tumour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his right Ear ariſing from a crude Matter. It had been of ſome years growth. I applied <hi>Emplaſtr. ad ſtrumas cum ſtercore columbino,</hi> to diſcuſs it, but it heated: whereupon I applied a Cataplaſm, one of the Suppuratives above mentioned, and concocted it; then opened it by Cauſtick, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a mixt crude Matter. The Ulcer being ſordid, I laid it more open, and dreſſed it with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> with <hi>alum. uſt.</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and dreſſed the Eſcar and inciſed Lips with Digeſtives. After the ſeparation of the Eſcar, I deterged the Abſceſs more powerfully by the uſe of the Vitriol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Praecipitate, and afterwards incarned by the common Incarnative uſed in ſuch caſes, and cicatrized it ſmooth without any remaining hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and the Youth enjoys his health well ſince.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about fifty years of age,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> having long laboured under Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticall affections, was ſeized with a ſlow Fever; his Head was affected with Vapours, and his Spirits oppreſſed: during which a Tumour aroſe behind his left Ear, and reach'd down under that Jaw, growing big and hard, of a dark red colour. We endeavoured by diſcutient and emollient Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms and Embrocations of various ſorts; but it would not yield to any of them. We repeated Venaeſection, and made him Fontanells <hi>inter Scapulas;</hi> Purgations were alſo repeated: but without ſucceſſs. I then applied an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſt. ad ſtrumas,</hi> and continued it without removall the ſpace of fix or ſeven days, ſuppoſing thereby the Tumour would ſuppurate or reſolve: yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued hard amongſt the Muſcles. I repeated the uſe of the Emplaſter; and the third or fourth day after, feeling the Matter fluctuate under it, I took off the Emplaſter, applied a Cauſtick on the depending Part about an inch in length, divided that Eſcar, and gave a diſcharge to a crude ſerous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then dreſſed it with Lenients, and applied <hi>Emplaſt. de mucilag.</hi> with a third part of <hi>diachly. cum gummi.</hi> After ſeparation of the Eſcar, I deterged with the Vitriol-ſtone and <hi>baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and at other Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings dipt them in <hi>pulv. praecipitati.</hi> Having thus deterg'd, I incarned, and by Epuloticks cicatrized it firm. During the while he was often purged, and Traumaticks and Antiſcorbuticks were preſcribed: but a hardenſs remained notwithſtanding. Whereupon, doubting a Recidivation, I applied another Cauſtick the length of that Induration; and, having thereby penetrated deep into it, divided that Eſcar to the quick: and by ſeparation of the Eſcar, and Digeſtion of the lips of the Ulcer, that hardneſs was breathed forth, and the Patient cured, and enjoys a good health to this day.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcuſcula</hi> round about it, never coming to digeſtion till it hath corrupted the Part which it ſeizeth, ſo that the whole piece cometh away, if the Patient recover.</p>
                     <p>It oweth its <hi>Originall</hi> to a very high Degeneration of the Bloud into a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that is of a cauſtick quality,<note place="margin">Originall.</note> which ſuddenly ariſing ſeizeth the Part and corrupteth it, burning it as it were to a coal, from whence it hath its Name.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe Degenerations of the Bloud are divers.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> The moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is a peſtilentiall Infection. But it is not ſeldom found that the Humours of ſome bodies do corrupt into ſo great a degree of virulency, as to cauſe ſuch a Tumour when there is no appearance of a Plague. Hence it is that they are divided into peſtilentiall, and not peſtilentiall: which diſtinction hath reference more to the antecedent Cauſe then to the Tumour it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is that,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> let the <hi>Carbuncle</hi> be of which ſort it will, the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms attending it are much alike; <hi>viz. nauſea,</hi> vomiting, dejection of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, <hi>tremor,</hi> palpitation of the heart, frequent ſwouning, <hi>delirium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The peſtilent is diſtinguiſhed from the non-peſtilent by the greatneſs of the Symptoms, and the Infection that is in the air.</p>
                     <p>A great <hi>Carbuncle</hi> is more dangerous then a ſmall one,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and the black is more pernicious then the inflamed red one. Thoſe that are in the Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Throat, or near any principall Part, have more of danger then thoſe that are ſeated remote in the Lims, eſpecially in the muſculous Fleſh. The moſt dangerous Symptom of all is the return of the Matter of the Carbuncle into the Bloud again.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of a <hi>Carbuncle</hi> two things offer themſelves to our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 1. the antecedent Cauſe, the over-heated corrupt Bloud abounding in the Body; 2. the conjunct, or the Humour affecting the Part, and making the <hi>Carbuncle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In order to the firſt, a regulation in Diet ought to be obſerved, and the hot Bloud fermenting in the body to be evacuated by Venaeſection, eſpecially in thoſe that are not peſtilentiall, and that to fainting: but in the peſtilentiall it is judged not ſo ſafe, leſt thereby the malignity be drawn inward; but if you do let bloud, it muſt be in the beginning, whilſt the body is ſtrong to bear it. And foraſmuch as Bleeding ſcarce evacuates all the depraved Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, therefore Purging is preſcribed, leſt by the abounding of corrupt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours the native heat ſhould be extinguiſhed. But in peſtilentiall Carbuncles there is alſo a Caution required upon the ſame conſideration as in Bleeding: therefore we content our ſelves with Clyſters and lenient Purgatives, as <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, caſſia, electuar. lenitiv. diaprun.</hi> and the like; and proceed in reſiſting the malignity by <hi>alexipharmaca, viz. theriaca, Mithridat. elect. de ovo, confect. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerm. de hyacintho,</hi> &amp;c. The heat of the bloud may be contemperated by <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup. è ſucco citr. limon. acetoſ. borrag. bugloſs.</hi> &amp;c. Or, ℞ <hi>conſ. borrag. bugloſs. lujulae, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>ſpec. de hyacintho</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>cort. citr. conditi, nucis moſchat. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>cum ſyr. è ſucco citr. fiat Electuarium.</hi> After a morſel of which, a draught of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95669:35"/>ſuch like Julep may be drank and repeated once in four hours: ℞ <hi>aquar. ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii, dracont. citr. an.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſpec. de hyacintho</hi>

                     <p>In treating the Carbuncle as it relates to the conjunct Cauſe, you ought to conſider the ſtrength of the Patient; and if it be not likely to thruſt forth kindly, you are to endeavour by Attraction to aſſiſt nature in the bringing it outward, by the application of a ſuch like Cataplaſm: ℞ <hi>ſummitat. rutae</hi> M.ij. <hi>fermenti acris</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ficus vet. num.</hi> viij. <hi>piperis albi</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>ſalis com.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>Miſce.</hi> Or that Cataplaſm propoſed in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Bubo ex theriaca coct. in cepa excavata.</hi> And, if there be occaſion, Cupping-glaſſes may be applied to help it forward. But if the Body be ſtrong and plethorick, and the Carbuncle thruſt forth with raging heat and pain, then that Cataplaſm preſcribed by <hi>Galen, ex foliis plantag. pan. tritic.</hi> decocted in Wine, may be of good uſe, it being by him commended to have the virtue moderately to repreſs the heat, and to digeſt. Others have propoſed an Emplaſter of Plantane-leaves, Galls, Lentills, and Wheat-bran, beaten up with Vinegar, and having thus mitigated its heat, they endeavour Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>But I never ſaw a true Carbuncle ſuppurate: therefore if the aforeſaid Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments avail not, I adviſe the ſcarifying or cutting deep into it, to give a breathing to the Humour; then dreſs it with ſome Eſcarotick that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt its malignity, as <hi>troch. Andronis, polyidae.</hi> Some Authours have propoſed the Cauſtick. Without doubt the actuall Cautery timely applied on ſome of them would ſave the Patient much pain, and ſhorten the Cure: for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity being thereby conſumed, the Eſcar might without much difficulty be digeſted, the heat about the Carbuncles alleviated the while by one of the above-mentioned Cataplaſms, and the Ulcer cured by the common method. But I refer this to the conſideration of the Chirurgeon; and ſhall give you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Carbuncle to confirm what I have delivered.</p>
                     <p>IN the time of the laſt great Plague a Perſon of Honour,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> about ſixty years of age, of a groſs Body and highly ſcorbuticall, was after dinner ſeized with a Rigour and Vomiting. His Phyſcian Sir <hi>Francis Prujean</hi> being out of Town, he ſent for me. I ſuſpecting it to be the beginning of ſome malign Fever, deſired to be excuſed, his condition requiring rather a knowing Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian then a Chirurgeon: but I was afterwards fetch'd by a more powerfull meſſenger, and found the Patient in his bed, vomiting, and in a burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I adviſed the giving hm <hi>Carduus</hi> Poſſet to further his Vomiting; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which I ſent for a mixture of <hi>theriaca Veneta &amp; conſ. lujulae,</hi> and cordial Julep of <hi>aq. dracont.</hi> &amp;c. as it is above ſet down in the method of Cure; of the former I gave him a morſell, and ſome of the Julep after it, and adviſed his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to repeat the uſe of them once in four hours. He reſted very diſquietly that night, but in the morning I found him more calm. I let him bloud, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Clyſter to be given that afternoon. As I was taking my leave of him, he diſired me to look upon his Back, it being very ſore. I ſuppoſed his Fontanells (which he had long continued <hi>inter Scapulas</hi>) were uneaſie; and, making way to look upon them, I found his Malady four fingers breadth beneath the right Fontanell. It was a dark red Swelling, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Cheſnut, lying very hard between the muſculous Fleſh and Skin, with many ſmall white Wheals about it of the ſimple <hi>Herpes.</hi> I was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the ſight, and dreſſed it haſtily up with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and retired to my houſe to make ready that Cataplaſm of <hi>Galen</hi>'s, which I ſoon after applied, and continued the uſe of it ſome days: during which the Carbuncle increaſed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95669:36"/>in breadth and hardneſs, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcuſcula</hi> alſo ſpred round it. Upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I applied the ſuppurative Cataplaſm above mention'd, to endeavour Maturation; and on the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcuſcula</hi> and Parts about <hi>unguent. nutritum,</hi> to calm the burning heat. The Patient's Body was kept ſoluble by Clyſters and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Purgatives; the cordiall Electuary and Julep were alſo frequently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his Diet was Broths with Wood-ſorrell and ſuch like Contempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives boil'd in them. Nevertheleſs the Fever continued, and the Patient lay dozed and ſomewhat delirous, as alſo troubled with a <hi>Singultus</hi> and <hi>Aphthae.</hi> Obſerving him daily more indiſpoſed, and the Carbuncle increaſing in bulk, and not likely to ſuppurate, I ſcarified deep into it, waſhed it with a Solution of <hi>theriaca Veneta &amp; mel Aegyptiac. in aceto vini,</hi> then fill'd the Inciſions with <hi>pulver. troch. polyidae,</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm over all <hi>ex farina orobi</hi> decocted in Oxymel. By the uſe of theſe Applications the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcuſcula</hi> dried, and the Carbuncle gleeted, but by the uſe of Lenients it digeſted after a few days; and as the Eſcar ſeparated, a well-concocted Matter diſcharged in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity daily more and more: yet the ſeparation of the mortified Carbuncle had left a very large Opening, and there appeared no conſiderable Swelling whereby one might judge the Cavity large. But feeling the Parts about, and preſſing my hand upon the right Clavicle and under that <hi>Axilla,</hi> the Matter poured out abundantly: yet theſe Parts were not inflamed during the growth of the Carbuncle. This put me upon a neceſſity of making an Inciſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and, cutting off the flapping Lips to prevent the retention of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I then dreſſed the Abſceſs with <hi>mundificat. ex apio,</hi> and the tender Lips with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi;</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex farina hordei, fabar. flor. roſ. rub.</hi> &amp;c. decocted in Oxymel, with Compreſs and Bandage. We had often propoſed the conſulting a Phyſician, but thoſe of his acquaintance were out of Town. Accidentally I met with Doctour <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> about the twentieth day near the Patient's houſe, and prevailed with him to viſit this Perſon. He ſaw the Abſceſs dreſſed, and the Patient labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring under the <hi>Singultus</hi> and <hi>Aphthae,</hi> alſo ſo dozed as he ſcarce ſpake to the Phyſician. He preſcribed the Patient Cordialls, and what elſe he thought neceſſary, and left ſeverall Preſcriptions for the Family. Untill then they ſuſpected not the Diſeaſe; though the Servants that waſhed his Linen brake out in Blanes on their Hands and Arms as far as they were in the Soap-ſuds. From the time I made that large Opening the Matter leſſened, and the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties healed up by agglutination, the Ulcer incarned, and was cicatrized by the common Epuloticks.</p>
                     <p>The ſame year I was fetched to a Child at nurſe in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> that had been ſome days ſick of a peſtilential Fever, during which a Carbuncle thruſt forth in the right Breaſt a little below the Clavicle, of the compaſs of a broad Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but it was then ſunk, and of a black colour. I divided it, and gave vent to a bloudy <hi>ſerum,</hi> and ſaw the Fleſh underneath it ſound: it was without Inflammation. I dreſſed it up with warm Digeſtives, and applied an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter of <hi>Mithridate</hi> on it; then gave it ſome <hi>Elect. de ovo</hi> diſſolved in a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of <hi>aq. theriacalis.</hi> I came too late, for the Child died a few hours after.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of a</hi> Paronychia.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PAronychia,</hi> ſo called by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> is a ſmall Swelling about the Nails and ends of the Fingers, known amongſt the <hi>Latins</hi> by the name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naritium:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Names.</note> by the vulgar people amongſt us it is generally called a <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaw.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Paronychiae:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differences.</note> they both affect one and the ſame Part, and are frequently taken one for the other, but are very different in their Symptoms. We ſhall diſtinguiſh them by the names of benign, and malign. The former riſe ſuperficially under the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and come ſuddenly to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration: whereas the malign <hi>Paronychia</hi> lieth deep amongſt the Ligaments and Tendons, and is ſlow in coming to maturity. I ſuppoſe it is that which is commonly called a <hi>Felon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The benign or milder Species takes its Originall from a bilious hot <hi>ſerum:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> the other is commonly ſaid to proceed from Aduſtion in the Bloud, with a mixture of Choler or ſalt Phlegm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paronychiae</hi> may truly be reckoned amongſt the Inflammations,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> they ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with great pain and burning heat, with Pulſation and Tenſion. The benign comes ſoon to maturation, and may be diſcerned by change of colour in the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> the Matter appearing under it as in a Bliſter.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a malign <hi>Paronychia</hi> are an intenſe vehement pain deep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ligaments and Tendons, with Fever, Fainting, and a ſlow Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> may be made by what hath been delivered of them,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that the benign cometh ſoon to Suppuration, and is as eaſily cured: the worſt danger that can behappen it is but a loſs of the Nail.</p>
                     <p>The other, which lieth deep, is of a malign quality; and, if it be not ſpeedily removed, will corrupt the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> rot the Bone, and ſoon extend its putrefaction to the next Joint, and threaten the welfare of the Hand.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Paronychiae</hi> Authours generally make no diſtinction.<note place="margin">Cure The method of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> They propoſe evacuation by Bleeding, and the obſervance of a ſlender Diet, as in a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> Concerning Topicks, they commend Repellents in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fluxion, but not with much aſtringency, (unleſs as Intercipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents upon the Parts above) leſt the Matter ſhould thereby be impacted in the Part, and corrupt the Bone: yet the Medicaments they then preſcribe do all partake of that quality; as, ℞ <hi>ol. roſ. &amp; myrtill. cum ſucco ſolani &amp; bol. Armen.</hi> and, ℞ <hi>gallas virides cum aceto mixt.</hi> Others mix Lenients with them, as that of <hi>ſucc. ſolani, plantag. portulac. umbilic. Vener. mucilag. ſem. pſyllii, cum dictis ſuccis vel aceto extract.</hi> to which they adde <hi>bol. Armen. gallas &amp; camphor. cum ol. roſ. &amp; myrtill.</hi> and <hi>unguent. alb. popul.</hi> &amp;c. Others mix Diſcutients with Repellents: as that of <hi>Paracelſ. galla cum melle mixta;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>ol. maſtich. ol. olivar. matur. an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>antimonii crud.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ſs. <hi>thuris</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>reſin. pini &amp; cerae, an. q. ſ. Miſce;</hi> or that <hi>ſulphuris vivi, fuliginis, allii, ſal. com. ſem. carui, an. p. aeq. Miſce.</hi> In caſe of pain, ℞ <hi>fol. malvae, byoſcyami, rad. althaeae, ſem. pſyllii, lini, foenugraeci:</hi> and theſe are Suppuratives, of which divers others are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by them. All which are proper in the benign <hi>Paronychia,</hi> as they are ſet down, and ſome of them may be applied to the malign one in its very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but while you endeavour Suppuration in it, the Bone will certainly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95669:37"/>corrupt. Therefore if the pain go not off by the firſt Applications, give a breathing to the Humour by cutting deep into the Part moſt affected, and then dreſs it up by ſuch like Lenients as follow: ℞ <hi>ſem. lini, foenug. pulv. an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>mucilag. ſem. pſyllii</hi> ℥j. <hi>vitell. unius ovi, croci, an.</hi> ℈ j. <hi>pingued. gallinae aut butyri recent. q. ſ. fiat Cataplaſma.</hi> Or, dreſs it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> by which the Wound will cure, if the Humour hath not altered the Part: if it hath, proceed as ſhall be ſhewed in the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin with the benign or milder Species, commonly called a <hi>Whitflaw.</hi> It is a Diſeaſe ſo common, that I think there is none but knows what it is, and how to cure it. Yet I ſhall give you two or three Inſtances, the better to diſtinguiſh it from the other.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about four years of age was brought to me while I was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Patient in a Noble Family.<note place="margin">Paronychia benigna. <hi>1. Obſervat.</hi>
                        </note> The Child was pained with a ſmall red Swelling about the inſide and root of the Nail of one of the Fingers. I applied a little <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> upon it. The ſecond day after I found the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhine under the Skin, and the Swelling lie like a Bliſter about part of the Nail. I opened it, as I had often ſeen the common people, by paſſing a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle through the Skin: it diſcharged a thin yellow Matter, and by two Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> it cured.</p>
                     <p>Such another I met with in the Finger of a Friend lying upon one ſide of the Nail.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> I opened it with a Lancet, and after the diſcharge of the Matter pared away that ſide of the Nail, and dreſſed the Bliſter with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi> Himſelf cured it with ſome of the ſame in two or three days.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman came to me not long ſince with one of theſe very large upon the pulp of one of his Thumbs;<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> it lay like a great Bliſter. I let it out with my Lancet, and dreſſed it up with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and gave him ſome of the ſame to cure it.</p>
                     <p>Another I ſaw lie under the fore-part of the Nail and Finger,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> very painfull for the while, but it quickly ſuppurated by Lenients. The Matter being let out, and part of the Nail cut away, it cured in a few days. But when this happens in ſcrophulous Children, or where acrimony abounds, the Cure is vexatious enough: but it doth ſeldom corrupt the Bone, nor is the pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable compared with that which paſſes under the name of a <hi>Felon</hi> or malign <hi>Paronychia;</hi> of which I ſhall now give you ſome Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman came to my houſe one night late,<note place="margin">Paronychia maligna. <hi>1. Obſervat.</hi>
                        </note> complaining exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a pain in the pulp of one of her Fore-fingers. I looked upon it, and felt it hot, but ſaw nothing of Swelling whereby I could judge it ſo ill. She ſeemed ready to ſwound with the pain. I propoſed the making Inciſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it to the Bone, not imagining ſo fearfull a creature would have permitted it; but ſhe readily aſſented: whereupon I preſently made a Puncture deep in the moſt pained part to the Bone, and ſuffered it to bleed while I made a Dreſſing of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> to apply upon it with an <hi>Emplaſt. è bolo;</hi> which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſhe complained of the ſmarting of the Wound, but ſaid it was nothing to the pain ſhe felt before. The next day I waited upon her at her Lodging: ſhe had ſlept well that night and in perfect eaſe. I took off the Dreſſing, and ſaw the Wound agglutinated, then dreſſed it as the night before, and from that time dreſſed it no more. After the ſame manner I have freed many in the beginning of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A young Fellow attending in a Nobleman's houſe was ſeized with a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pain in the pulp of one of his Fore-fingers,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> and came to me bemoaning his condition. The Part affected felt hot, but ſeemed neither inflamed nor
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95669:37"/>much ſwelled. I preſt in the point of my Inciſion-knife into the place where he was moſt pained, and in the drawing out the Knife enlarged the Wound a little. There ſeemed to iſſue out onely a little Bloud, which I permitted a while to flow, then dreſſed it up with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo.</hi> The ſecond day after I met him, took off the Dreſſings, and ſaw the Wound cured: and he ſaid the pain went off that night he went from me.</p>
                     <p>Another Young man ſerving in a Noble Family was afflicted with a pain in the pulp of one of his Thumbs,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> and after three or four days triall of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Applications he was commended to me. His Thumb being inflamed and ſwelled, I made Inciſion into it to the Bone: this not onely bled, but gleeted a few drops. I dreſſed it with Lenients, and rowled it moderately, hoping thereby to agglutinate it. The ſecond day after I took off the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and, finding the Wound open and undigeſted, dreſſed it up with a Doſſill dipt in <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> with Emplaſter and Bandage. The third day after I dreſſed it again. The Doſſill came off with a Slough, and left the Ulcer diſpoſed to Digeſtion. I dreſſed it with a leſs Doſſill ſpred with <hi>baſilicon</hi> and Praecipitate, with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. diapompholygos,</hi> and an Emplaſter over it. From that day it digeſted, and cured in ſix or ſeven. The occaſion of its not healing by Agglutination, as the others did, was from the alteration (I ſuppoſe) the <hi>Ichor</hi> had began to make in the bottom of the Wound: which may, I think, enough ſhew the neceſſity of laying theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours open more timely, unleſs they have diſcovered ſome other way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the Humour; which I confeſs I have not been able to make out, though I have tried many Medicaments commended in ſuch caſes. <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> in his fifth Book and ſixteenth Obſervation, ſets down ſome <hi>arcana</hi> in the Cure of it: but after the triall of them, we find him foiled in the Cure of his Patient, and the ſame Patient cured by another Chirurgeon, by the laying it open, and taking the rotten Bone out.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now ſhew you what they are when they have been longer treated by Suppuratives, and the like.</p>
                     <p>A Servant to an Officer of the Court was brought to me ſorely afflicted with one of theſe <hi>Paronychiae</hi> in his Fore-finger by the ſide of the Nail.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> He had been under hands that had treated it with Medicaments till the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction within had rotted the Ligaments and <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> and bared the Bone of the firſt Joint, and apoſtemated it to the third Joint. I laid it open by Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the very end of the Finger downwards the length of the Abſceſs, and dreſſed it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> applying Doſſills over it ſpred with a Digeſtive to keep the Lips of the Wound diſtended, and with long ſnips of <hi>Empl. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalcit.</hi> rowled it up, leaving way between for the Matter to diſcharge, over which I repeated a moderate Bandage to preſs out the Matter in the Part, and reſtrain the Influx, and reduce the Finger to its former ſhape. The third day I dreſſed it again, and, finding the Ulcer ſordid and over-grown with looſe fleſh, rubb'd it with the Vitriol-ſtone, filling the Ulcer again with <hi>Merc. praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitat.</hi> and dreſſed it up as before. By this method I deterged the Ulcer, and with Sarcoticks incarned it, and by the application of Epuloticks with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage cicatrized it, and reduced the Finger to its naturall ſhape, ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>A Lady commended a Poor woman to me, who brought her Child,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> a little Boy of about five years of age, grievouſly diſeaſed of a <hi>Paronychia</hi> on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of the Fore-finger and under the Nail. The end of the Finger was rotted away, and the Bone ſticking out bare: the Nail was alſo rotten, and heaved up by the putrefaction underneath it. I took hold of the Nail with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95669:38"/>my <hi>Forceps,</hi> deſigning to cut it off, (it lying in my way;) but it ſeparated off from the root more eaſily. I alſo pinch'd off as much of the end of the Bone as was naked, rubb'd the looſe Fleſh and the remaining Bone with my Vitriol-ſtone, and applied a Pledgit of Lint dipt in a Solution of <hi>tinctur. vitrioli</hi> next the Bone, then fill'd the Ulcer with Praecipitate, laying over it an <hi>Emplaſtr. unguent. è lithargyro</hi> with a moderate Bandage. The third day I dreſſed it again, and found a ſeparation of the corrupt fleſh: but the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was more then I could reaſonably expect from ſuch an Ulcer. Whereupon I made a farther ſearch, and found a <hi>Sinus</hi> running the length of the ſecond Joint. I preſently made an Inciſion that length, and fill'd up the Opening with Doſſills dipt in Lenients, then dreſſed the more corrupt parts with the ſame Medicaments as before, and rowled it up. The third day after I took off the Dreſſings, and found the Bone covered with its <hi>Perioſteum</hi> in the <hi>Sinus</hi> I had laſt opened: but it was full of a looſe Fleſh the whole length. I dreſſed it as I had done the former; the Vitriol-ſtone being of great uſe in theſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which ſo abound with luxurious Fleſh amongſt the Tendons: for by it the corrupt Fleſh is dried up without offending the Nerves, Tendons, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſound Parts; and the Ulcer may be deterged, according as it is touched, more or leſs; and the Bone it ſelf, where it is bare or carious, may be dried by it, and diſpoſed to moulder off. Where the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> was great, there I alſo ſprinkled it with Praecipitate, whereby I more ſpeedily freed the Ulcer of its putrefaction; and by the application of long ſnips of Emplaſter rowled about the Finger I reſtrained the influx of Humour. By moderate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion I reſtored the Finger to its true ſhape, and by the common Epuloticks cicatrized it, without more loſs of the Bone then what I cut off at the firſt Dreſſing, the Stump exfoliating inſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I had the honour to attend the King at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> a Woman rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one of the <hi>Princeſs Royall</hi>'s Servants had been lamentably afflicted with one of theſe malign Ulcers in the Fore-finger of her right Hand: by reaſon of the long application of Supputatives the Bones of the firſt and ſecond Joint were rotted, and the putrefaction had ſpred round, and corrupted their Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I made Inciſion the length of the Abſceſs, and upon farther ſearch fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Bones not onely rotten, but loofe, I took them both out, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the Nail from ſome part of the Ligament to which it adhered; then deterg'd the Ulcer by filling it with Praecipitate, dreſſed the Lips with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives, and rowled it up. After I had thus deterged it, and by Compreſſes and Bandage reduced the Finger to a better figure, I left off the uſe of Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills, and by long pieces of Emplaſter brought the Lips together, and left the Finger well ſhaped, and a Nail thruſt out again: but it, having loſt its Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, was of little uſe. Whether afterwards any <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt out to ſupply the place of the Bones, I doubt: but in ſtrumous and ſome other Ulcers you may ſee how ſuch defect hath been recompenſed.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince I was fetcht into the City to a Gentlewoman who was much afflicted with one of theſe malign Ulcers in the very firſt Joint of one of her Fingers.<note place="margin">7. Obſervat.</note> The Chirurgeon that attended it had been ſuppurating it, but the while the Bone corrupted. I propoſed the laying it open by Inciſion, and to have proceeded by Deterſion. She aſſented to it, and accordingly it was laid open. After a Dreſſing or two I left it to the Chirurgeon. But about ten days after ſhe ſent for me again, and was much unſatisfied in the proceedings. I looked upon it, and, ſeeing it was like to be a tedious and an unſucceſsfull work, adviſed the cutting off of her Finger: which, after ſome deliberation, ſhe ſubmitted unto.</p>

                        <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ſeized with a pain in the end of her Fore-finger, and deſired my advice. I told her the nature of the Diſeaſe, and ſhewed her the neceſſity of making a Puncture with an Inciſion-knife into the pained Part: but ſhe went murmuring away from me, and made uſe of ſome other, who endeavoured to ſuppurate it. In the while I made her a viſit or two to perſuade her from that methold; but ſhe would not permit me to open it. Some while after, the putrefaction being increaſed, it made its way out, and diſcharged ſome of its <hi>Sordes.</hi> This they called Suppuration, and promiſed themſelves a ſpeedy Cure, cenſuring me for adviſing her to open it before Maturation. But in theſe Abſceſſes the Suppuration is falſe, and rarely happens till the Bone and Ligaments are corrupted: which after a while ſhe finding too true, made friends to me; at whoſe deſire I viſited her, and found the Finger miſerably ſwelled, and the Ulcer ſordid, the Bone lying rotten in it. I dreſſed it with Deterſives, and offered to her conſideration, whether ſhe would permit the Ulcer to be cut open, (for Cauſticks are of ill uſe in Ulcers with <hi>Caries</hi> in theſe Parts,) and dreſſed with ſuch Medicaments as might cleanſe it, and diſpoſe the Bone to exfoliate, which would be a long work, and uncertain; or that ſhe would without more delay permit it to be cut off, and thereby have it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily cured. After ſome demurre, ſhe ſubmitted to the latter; and I cut it off with a Chiſell, dreſſed up the Stump with <hi>pulv. Galeni cum albumine ovi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and rowled it on. The ſecond day after I dreſſed it <hi>cum terebinth. &amp; vitell. ovi,</hi> &amp;c. and digeſted it; and afterwards I incarned it with the common Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and cicatrized it in few days with <hi>unguent. deſiccat. rubr.</hi> and Pledgits dipt in <hi>aqua calcis.</hi> She gave me a great many good words for the ridding her of ſuch a painfull Finger, but never forgave me the neglect (as ſhe called it) of dreſſing it with Suppuratives; ſhe ſuppoſing that I could ſo have cured it, and would not. It was a crime which might be the eaſilier forgiven her, ſince we meet with it ſo often in ſome of our own Profeſſion.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of</hi> Pterygion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PTerygion</hi> is an Excreſcence of fleſh about the Nails of the Fingers or Toes.<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> A <hi>Whitflaw</hi> ariſing about the Nails is often the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Diſeaſe in the Fingers: it is alſo cauſed by ſome Bruiſe of the fleſh under or about the Nails. Sometime an Excreſcence ariſeth from the root of the Nails by reaſon of ſome Puſtule that preceded; in which caſe the Membrane underneath is often concerned.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth alſo in the Toes through ſome Bruiſe or preſſure of the Nail, eſpecially where the Nail is thick and hard, as ſome over-grown Nails are, whence pain and Inflammation is ſtirred up, and an eruption of Matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, which being exaſperated by a continuall pricking or preſſure of the Nail, the Ulceration ſpreads and corrupts it, and thruſts out Excreſcences and looſe fleſh round about. When this happeneth in poor people, who travel much in the wet and dirt, and want that accommodation which is neceſſary to keep their feet dry and clean, the Matter corrupts the Tendons and Bones; as I have frequently ſeen amongſt our common Souldiers in the time of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, and amongſt ſome of the poor people that come out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95669:39"/>in the time of publick Healing, to be touched for the <hi>King's Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They take their <hi>Difference</hi> from the Cauſe,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> and Part which they affect: ſome riſing ſuperficially in the ſides of the Nail with eroſion; whereas others, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Tendons, corrupt the Bones.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are evident,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> the Ulceration and Excreſcences appearing about the root or ſides of or under the Nails with pain. If it affect the Tendons or Membrane under the Nail, the pain is more vehement: if the Bone be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the putrefactive Smell will diſcover it.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Pterygion</hi> affecting the Skin there is no great difficulty of Cure:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> if the Nail be pared away, the Ulceration will ſoon heal. But if it ariſe from the Tendons or Membrane at the root of the Nail, the work is more hard, and in old people, or Bodies ill habited, it is apt to gangrene.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of the ſuperficiall Ulcerations with looſe fleſh ariſing about the Nail,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> you are in the firſt place to cut away the Nail, that you may apply your Medicaments to the Ulceration, which may conſume or dry the looſe fleſh and cicatrize it: in which caſe you may uſe a little dry Lint, or Lint dipt in <hi>aq. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> and dried, or <hi>pulv. cort. granat. balauſt. terr. ſigillat. lap. tutiae;</hi> in ſtronger habits, <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> You are to avoid the application of moiſt or greaſy Medicaments, for they rot the Nails, and increaſe the Ulceration. The Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences ariſing from the Tendons or Membrane to the roots of the Nails require Medicaments more powerfully dying; ſuch as are <hi>aes uſtum, ſquamae aeris, calx viva, troch. polyidae, Andronis, Muſae:</hi> yea the Cauſtick-ſtone warily uſed, <hi>Merc. praecipit.</hi> and the Vitriol or Alume-ſtone, may ſerve to cicatrize the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>A Young Lady having bruiſed her Fore-finger accidentally, and neglected the Cure,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Nail of the Fore-finger.</note> it corrupted under the Nail, and became very ſore. I was ſent for, and found the inſide of the Nail looſe, the skin at the root of the Nail rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up, and full of ſpongy fleſh. I preſently cut away the ſide of the Nail, to give diſcharge to the Matter, then dreſſed it with dry Lint, and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over it. The Excreſcence riſing from the root of the Nail I dreſſed with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and laid a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over that Swelling, with a ſnip of <hi>Emplaſtr. diachalcit.</hi> as an intercipient, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it up. The Ulceration on the ſide where I cut the Nail away cicatrized by the foreſaid Dreſſings; but that at the root of the Nail I found ſwelled; the Praecipitate had cruſted the looſe fleſh and ſtopped the Matter in. I ſcraped it away, and filled the Ulcer again with the ſame Praecipitate, and applied a Pledgit and Emplaſter over it, as before. The ſecond day after I dreſſed it again, and found it more hollow, the looſe fleſh coming away in a Slough. I then left off the uſe of the Praecipitate, and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> with an Emplaſter, and made a moderate Compreſſion over the Ulcer to unite the Cavity, and thereby agglutinated it in three or four Dreſſings, and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the lax edges with the Alume-ſtone and dry Lint. This Nail being caſt off, a new one thruſting forth reſtored the Part to its naturall figure. From ſuch Ulcerations at the roots of the Nails there often ariſe great Excreſcences, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the Thumbs, and are extremely painfull and difficult to cure.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to one who was grievouſly afflicted with ſuch an Excreſcence: it was as big as a Cherry-ſtone;<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence on the Thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nail.</note> it was hard and gleeted, and the parts about it much inflamed. I applied a ſnip of Emplaſter between the Excreſcence and the Nail: then I rubbed the Excreſcence with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and with an armed Probe dried up the Salt as it diſſolved in the working. After I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Excreſcence, I waſht out the Salts in the Eſcar with a little Wine warm, pulled away the ſnip of the Emplaſter which I had laid to defend the Nail form the Cauſtick, and covered the Eſcar with Praecipitate, applying a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95669:39"/>Pledgit of <hi>baſilicon,</hi> and an <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> over it. I dreſſed it the next day leſt the gleet ſhould offend the Nail; but I found it dry, and Patient eaſie from an hour after I had laſt dreſſed it up. I continued the uſe of Lenients, and, after the Slough ſeparated, rubbed the remaining root with Vitriol-ſtone, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it with Praecipitate again; and afterwards by dreſſing it twice or thrice with Praecipitate dried it up.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of the Nail of the great Toe.</note> having layn ſome while under Phyſick and Chirurgery for an Ulceration about the Nail of his great Toe, conſulted me. I ſaw the Matter flow round the Nail, yet the Nail was not looſe, nor did it ſeem to preſs into the fleſh; for there had been a Corn-cutter who had cleared it: and in truth I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Matter to ariſe from behind the root of the Nail, it being there hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and inflamed. To make a farther diſcovery, I filled all the chinks with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and with a dry Pledgit of Lint and <hi>Emplaſtr. de minio</hi> dreſſed it up. A day or two after when we dreſſed it, we found the Nail overflowed with Matter, and could make no certain judgment of its originall: whereupon we dreſſed one ſide with Praecipitate, the other with dry Lint, and that behind the Nail with <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and thereby it appeared that the Matter aroſe from behind the Nail. For by this way of dreſſing the ſides dried, but after we filled that Cavity over and behind the root of the Nail, the Matter burſt out under the Nail, and was ſeen to lie in the ſides. Upon which Phyſick was again propoſed, to purge off the naughty Humours: but indeed the Cure conſiſted in the cutting off that callous Skin behind the root of the Nail. But my Brother Chirurgeon diſſenting, the Patient complied with him to avoid the pain. Yet after a farther experiment by dreſſing two or three days, I prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and with an Inciſion-knife cut off that callous Skin, then digeſted it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and in as few days cicatrized it: and from that time there appeared no more Matter or Sore.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 70 years of age,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> having Nails on his great Toes very big, hard and crooked, the one of them preſſed ſo ſtreight upon the Membrane underneath it as to make an Ulceration, which increaſing with putrefaction, he came to Town. It ſeemed to me to be gangrened underneath the Nail; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſently paſſed my Knife under the Nail; and made a ſeparation of it. The ſides of the Nail lay very deep, and in ſome parts tied faſt by its Ligament. It being removed, I waſhed the Ulcer with Wine; but it bleeding too faſt to make any farther judgment of it at that time, I covered it with Praecipitate, and retained it on by Pledgits of Lint and Emplaſter. The ſecond day after I found it cruſted with the Praecipitate, but a corrupt Matter burſting through it in ſeverall parts, and the Ulcer appearing deep, I took off that Cruſt, and dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> mixt with Praecipitate and <hi>alúm. uſt.</hi> and by Detergents and Epuloticks, as hath been ſhewed in the preceding Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I deterged and cicatrized it: then cauſing the Nail of the other great Toe to be raſped and cut round, to prevent the like accident, I diſmiſſed him.</p>
                     <p>Sometime in elderly people a crude Humour diſeaſes the Tendons and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes at the root of the Nail, and through defect of the naturall heat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it, and if it be not timely ſuccoured a Mortification follows.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of above 70 years of age,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> complaining of a Sore at the root of the Nail of one of his great Toes, was commended to my care. The Ulcer was crude, and had corrupted the Fleſh and part of the Ligament. I dreſſed it up with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> with a Pledgit of dry Lint upon the Nail; and over the Part affected applied <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> with <hi>Emplaſtr. diachalcit.</hi> The ſecond day after, opening it again, but finding no digeſtion, I dreſſed it as before, and the next day fomented it with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein was decocted <hi>abſinth.</hi> &amp;c. I cleanſed the Ulcer of the Praecipitate, and dreſſed it with a Doſſil dipt <hi>in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95669:40"/>oleo terebinth.</hi> hot and <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> with an Emplaſter over it. The next day I dabbled it hot with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> upon an armed Probe, filled it with Praecipitate, dreſſed it up as the day before, and deſired that a Phyſician might be called to ſee the evil quality of the Ulcer, I ſuſpecting it would not digeſt. The ſecond day after Doctour <hi>Jaſper Nedham</hi> met me, and ſaw the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer dreſſed. There then lay a hard dry Eſcar without either Matter or Gleet, which I took for a good Sign, and with my Knife made a little Separation of the Eſcar, to give vent to it, and dreſſed it up with Lenients, to haſten the fall of the Eſcar. It was ſeven or eight days in ſeparating, and then it came off with a well-digeſted Matter, incarned, and in few days cicatrized.</p>
                     <p>When theſe Ulcers corrupt the Bone, the beſt way is to cur off that rotten Joint, to preſerve the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus one being affected with a putrefactive Ulcer to the Bone,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> part whereof lay bare under the Nail of one of her great Toes, I adviſed the cutting off that Joint: which ſhe conſenting to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as being the moſt eaſie and ſpeedy way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent farther miſchief) I ſent for a Mallet and Chiſell, and cut if off. Then having permitted it to bleed ſome ounces, I dreſſed it up with <hi>pulv. Galeni cum albumine ovi,</hi> with ſome ſnips of an Emplaſter croſs over the Stump, and a piece of a Sheep's bladder with Bandage to retain the Dreſſings cloſe. The ſecond day after I dreſſed it <hi>cum terebinthina &amp; vitello ovi,</hi> and thereby digeſted it, then incarned it with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> and with the help of the Vitriol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Pledgits dipt in a Solution of <hi>ſacch.

                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are manifeſt in the back of the Hands and Fingers,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as we generally expreſs them, ſwelled with cold. They are of a thick red colour, and thruſt out many ſmall Wheals which itch very much, and being rubb'd do ulcerate and chop the Skin, and diſcharge a thin Humour. <hi>Kibes</hi> appear after the ſame manner in the Heels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chilblanes</hi> are exempt from danger,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but are vexatious, and not eaſie to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95669:40"/>cure whilſt the cold weather laſts, and being cured are apt to return yearly. The <hi>Kibes</hi> may prove dangerous, and difficult to cure, if they be any whit neglected, the Matter being apt to ulcerate the Fleſh to the Bone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gangrene.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> the manner of living is to be conſidered,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> eſpecially that they defend themſelves from cold, and keep their Feet dry and warm. Of the Medicaments proper in this Diſeaſe ſome are preſervative, while the Skin is whole; and others are curative, and neceſſary when they are whealed and ulcerated.</p>
                     <p>The Preſervatives are, as I have ſaid, to cloath the Parts warm, that the Pores may be open to give a breathing to the Humour: to which purpoſe furred Gloves and woollen Mittens and Socks are to be commended, alſo Dog-skin Gloves for the poorer ſort; the richer may have oiled Gloves. Socks dipt in Brandy-wine and worn are preventive. The Mariners to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this Diſeaſe in their Hands dip their Mittens in Sea-water, and having wrung out the water, draw them on. All Fomentations, whether it be freſh water, or Beef or Fiſh-broth, are proper to further Tranſpiration. In the Cure we commend the Decoction of warm Plants, as Wormwood, Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Mugwort, Marjoram, Thyme, Hyſſop, Rue, Roſemary, Bays and Juniper, with their Berries. Turneps are the ſpecifick, and if they be fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen they are more efficacious. <hi>

                     <p>A Girl of about nine years of age, of a very ill Habit of body,<note place="margin">1 Obſervat. of Chilblanes and Kibes.</note> was the laſt hard Winter very much troubled with Chilblanes upon her Hands and Fingers. She had alſo Kibes on her Heels, and about one of her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and on the ſmall of the other Leg. I directed a Fomentation of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of ſome of the aforeſaid Plants, with an addition of Brandy-wine, with which they were all bathed. The excoriated Chilblanes I dreſſed with <hi>unguent. de lithargyr.</hi> upon Pledgits of Lint lying at ſuch diſtance as the Matter might get out between. The cluſters of Wheals were dapt with a Solution of <hi>ſacchar. Saturni in ſpir. vini,</hi> and the forementioned Cerote appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all. From the Kibes, which were ulcerated and ſordid, I clipt the looſe <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and dreſſed them with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and ſprinkled ſome of them firſt with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> The Excoriations about them were dreſſed with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. according as they required, during which ſhe was purged, and happily cured.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">2.

                        <hi>calomel.</hi> and <hi>reſina Jalapii:</hi> by which method ſhe was cured, but hath been ſince ſubject to Chilblanes, and I believe will be ſo every Winter as long as ſhe lives.</p>
                     <p>I was fetched to a Youth about ten years of age who had Kibes on both his Heels.<note place="margin">3.

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of a</hi> Varix.</head>
                     <p>HItherto I have treated of Tumours ariſing from the ſerous part of the Bloud: I ſhall now deliver ſomewhat of thoſe which take their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from pure Bloud; and they are of three ſorts, <hi>Varix, Ecchymoſis,</hi> and <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varix</hi> is the dilatation of a Vein: it happeneth in divers parts of the Body; but for the moſt part the Thighs and Legs, the Teſticles and haemorrhoïdall Veins, and in Women the Belly, are frequently affected.</p>
                     <p>It proceedeth from the reſtagnation of groſs Bloud,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> which being tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Veins, either by reaſon of the depending of the Part, or from ſome other preſſure upon the Veſſel, or elſe by its own groſsneſs, proves unapt for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Then, in ſtead of continuing its current proportionably to the other Parts, it ſtops in the place and coagulates, and by degrees encreaſeth it ſelf by the acceſſion of the like particles out of the ſucceeding Bloud; and, inlarging its bulk, dilateth its Veſſels into a capacity big enough to receive it. This coagulation of Bloud in a <hi>Varix</hi> is not ſo entire as to ſtop the paſſage wholly up. For the ſucceeding current alway forceth at leaſt its thinner parts by the ſides of the <hi>Coagulum,</hi> and conſequently helpeth the dilatation. But it lieth lazily there, and ſuffers the reſt of the ſtream to paſs by it. This moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens in cutaneous Veſſels, where the Veins have no aſſiſtence from muſcular Fleſh, which by frequent preſſure would otherwiſe be apt to ſqueeze it forwards. To which it may be added, that the Valves of the Vein ſo ſwelled, whether naturally or accidentally, are weakened, and do not ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Bloud in its aſcent; ſo that, falling down upon the ſides of the Veſſel, the weight of it is too great to be driven forward by the venall motion of the Bloud.</p>
                     <p>All parts of the Body are capable of <hi>Varices,</hi> though they are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the depending ones, as the Thighs, Belly, haemorrhoïdall Veins, the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95669:41"/>Teſticles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the reaſon aforeſaid. But in other places, where depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cannot be the cauſe of the Check of Circulation, we do ſee <hi>Varices</hi> to grow.</p>
                     <p>In ſome places it oweth its original to natural Cauſes; as to the generation of Milk in the Breaſts, and of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb: in both which caſes, Nature being obliged to ſpend the nutritious <hi>Serum</hi> upon the uſes there inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Bloud returns thick, and is apt to reſtagnate, and uſually increaſeth the Veins at thoſe times to ſix or ſeven, it may be ten, times their natural big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: which very accident is by Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> (in his Book <hi>De for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matu foetûs</hi>) made uſe of as an argument to prove, that the nutritious juices are carried to thoſe places by the Arteries, and not by any peculiar Veſſels. But it alſo preternaturally falleth out ſo in Tumours of the Breaſts and other Parts: in all which (but moſt viſibly in <hi>Cancers</hi>) the Veſſels inlarge, and the Veins become varicous. The cauſe of which may be referred either to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation of the <hi>Serum,</hi> or grumouſneſs of the Bloud, or to the obſtruction of the Vein ſomewhere in its paſſage by ſome anguſtation upon it by part of the Tumour; from whence it will often happen that the Vein beyond it hath its current ſtopped, and is forced to ſwell. Nay, not onely the contraction of the Veſſels by preternatural Tumours doth this, but alſo any other Preſſure. As in a Woman with Child, the burthen lying upon the <hi>Ramus iliacus</hi> on either ſide of the body, makes the Thigh and Leg on all that ſide varicous. Streight gartering doth the like in the Leg. So the weight of the Teſticles, or the preſſure of a Bolſter-Truſs, in caſe of Rupture, renders them varicous. Riding much on horſe-back doth the like, by reaſon of the preſſure that is made upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Thigh by the Saddle, to which it uſually clings; eſpecially if you ride with long Stirrups. So alſo by much walking and in Labouring-people <hi>Varices</hi> uſually happen, being occaſioned, as I ſuppoſe, by the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction the Muſcles are put upon in ſtanding, which being ſo contracted do preſs upon the upper branches of the Veins in the Thigh, and ſtreighten them, thereby hindring the free aſcent of the Bloud.</p>
                     <p>They are eaſily known, in what external Parts ſoever they are,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> by the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, the crooked figure of the Veins, and azure colour, which is more or leſs apparent as the Veins lie ſuperficial or deep.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>Hernia varicoſa</hi> is, the unequal knotted Tumour in the Vein leading to the Teſticle, with a relaxation of the ſame Teſticle: and when the Teſticles are inflated with Wind, the Vein in alſo diſtended and painfull. What the Signs are of the Haemorrhoïdal <hi>Varices,</hi> and how they are to be treated, you may ſee in their peculiar Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varices</hi> are not dangerous in themſelves,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> they rather free the Patient from imminent Diſeaſes, eſpecially thoſe of Melancholy; according to that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of <hi>Hippocrates, Inſanis ſi varices vel haemorrhoïdes ſuperveniunt, fit inſaniae ſolutio.</hi> Which words are to be underſtood of Veins if they grow very large, or if they break and run: but if they flow intemperately, <hi>Cachexia,</hi> Dropſie, Conſumption, and ſuch like Diſeaſes, follow. So, on the contrary, if they be unſeaſonably ſuppreſt, Madneſs, Pleuriſie, Coughing of bloud, pain in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Apoplexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do follow. The <hi>Hernia varicoſa</hi> or <hi>Cirſocele</hi> is difficult to cure, as the reſt are.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Varices</hi> ought not to be cured, unleſs they be painfull,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> or that they be extended into a large Tumour, or ulcerate and bleed much: for, as I have ſaid, they preſerve health. But if there be a neceſſity of curing them, it ought to begin with Purging and Bleeding, not once or twice, but often repeated; and if the <hi>Viſcera</hi> be in fault, they ought to be ſtrengthened and amended; after which the Cure may be endeavoured by aſtringent and exſiccant Medicaments,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95669:42"/>and thoſe to be applied with convenient Bandage, to preſs back the bloud co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating in the Veſſel, and moderately reſiſt the Current. If theſe ſuffice not, then, according to the ancient practice, you are to proceed by Section, dividing the Skin and ſeparating the Teguments; and having raiſed the varicous Vein, you are to paſs a Ligature above and another beneath it, making a deligation of them; then ſlit the Vein, caſt out the groſs Bloud, and afterwards digeſt and heal it, as is after ſaid in an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi> With what ſucceſs this hath been done, you may reade in the Works of <hi>Fabricius Hildanus:</hi> and whether the pain be little or much worth the while, you may ſee <hi>Marius</hi> his Argument thereof in his Life ſet down by <hi>Plutarch.</hi> In my Practice I have met many diſeaſed with varicous Swellings in the Thighs, Legs, Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of them very large, and as unſightly as troubleſome: but I never met with one Patient that cared to hear of the Cure by Ligature, nor indeed have I ſeen any great reaſon for it. For if the unſightlineſs and pain be in the Legs, it may be helped by the wearing a laced Stocking, placing a Card, piece of Vellum or beaten Lead between them. A laced Trowze will doe as much for the Thigh. When they affect the Belly, they may be reſtrained by a Bracer, without much trouble to the Patient, or inconvenience to his health. But if you ſuſpect it, you may in great <hi>Varices</hi> both purge and bleed them. The Medicaments externally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied are <hi>balauſt. cortices granat. roſ. rubr. nuc. cupreſſ. Empl. Caeſaris, unguent. ſumach.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the <hi>Hernia varicoſa</hi> is by good Bandage, <hi>viz.</hi> a Bag-Truſs, and the ſame Medicaments above mentioned: but if they be diſtended with Wind, treat them as flatulent Tumours. How the <hi>Varices</hi> when ulcerated ought to be dreſſed and cured, you may ſee in the Treatiſe of <hi>

                     <p>ANother ſort of Tumour ariſing from meer Bloud is the <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> called by the <hi>Latins Suffuſio</hi> or <hi>Sugillatio:</hi> which two latter are more proper to the Eye then other Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> may be defined,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> an Extravaſation of the Bloud in or under the Skin or any other Part, the Skin remaining whole.</p>
                     <p>It is an eruption of Bloud from the leſſer Veſſels in the Skin or near it,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> whether from Blow, Bruiſe, Fall, or Prick of a Lancet in Chirurgery, when the Orifice of the Vein lieth not directly under the Orifice made in the Skin, ſo as that the whole ſtream may diſcharge there, and after bleeding both be cloſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For if when you cloſe the outermoſt the inner lieth open, it will make a Sugillation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe external Effuſions are the Subject of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>To the better underſtanding of the nature of theſe, it will be neceſſary to divide the Bloud into two parts, <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Grumus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Serum</hi> is that fluid ſubſtance which floweth about the <hi>Coagulum</hi> or <hi>Gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in the Chirurgeon's Porrenger. It is not onely the nutritious juice that nouriſheth all the parts of the Body, but alſo the Balſam that heal it; and is that thing that is capable of digeſtion, diſcuſſion, and many other alterations. This is the <hi>Vehiculum</hi> of the <hi>Grumus,</hi> and whilſt it circulates doth keep it fluid, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95669:42"/>cauſeth its perpetual motion through all the Veſſels and Pores, as long as they continue incorporate together. And in Extravaſation, if the effuſion be not great, it will by degrees ſwallow up the <hi>Grumus,</hi> diſſolving it and returning it into the Veins again: but if the effuſion be great, ſo that the <hi>Grumus</hi> ſeparates from the <hi>Serum</hi> in the Contuſion, there it difficultly re-uniteth with the <hi>Serum</hi> again, much leſs digeſts, but either putrefieth in the Part, making Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes Gangrenes; or elſe, which is more ſeldom, hardens there and dries, making onely a <hi>morbus in numeris partium.</hi> Such a one Doctour <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Needham</hi> and my ſelf ſaw in the Foot of a young Gentlewoman, who was our Patient upon another account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> of a Contuſion are the black and blew colour with or without Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> The Cauſes,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> as Blow, Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are learned from the By-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>The danger is ſmall, if the Contuſion be ſuch:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> alſo whilſt the Humours are thin and fluid, there is hopes of returning them back, or they may be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcuſſed.</p>
                     <p>But when any great Contuſion happens, there the caſe alters, and danger is often great: of which, to omit many others, that of <hi>Ingraſſius</hi> is a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable inſtance; where a Nobleman's Leg being bruiſed by the armed Knee of one that encountred him on horſe-back, it killed him in three days.</p>
                     <p>When the Part, in ſtead of being black, blew or green, groweth red, hard and painfull, the danger is eminent. Such was the caſe of a fat Gentleman, who, by a Fall upon his Buttocks going down ſtairs, bruiſed thoſe Parts, and neglecting the Cure, it tended toward a Gangrene, but was got off by Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Diſcutients.</p>
                     <p>Since the diſcovery of the Circulation of the Bloud,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> ſome people have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to themſelves the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Diſeaſe by returning the Bloud back into its Veſſels by warm Applications, as <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> &amp;c. Which poſſibly may have ſeemed to effect it where the <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> hath been ſmall: but in great effuſions of bloud, accompanied with much pain, it is not reaſonable to hope a return of the Bloud by ſuch Applications; for thereby the Tumour would be made bigger, and the leaſt that can be expected therefrom is a Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereas thoſe which ſhall be treated according to the method of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, by Repellents, and afterwards by Diſcutients, ſhall be ſecured from Apoſtemations, and ſoon recovered, if the Habit of the body be any whit good.</p>
                     <p>If the Effuſion of great, we begin the Cure by opening a Vein, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bloud proportionably. If it be ſmall, the common Remedy of brown Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſoaked in cold water or Oxycrate may ſerve for the firſt Applications; and afterwards the Sugillation may be breathed forth by fomenting it with Diſcutients, or warm water, or with <hi>ſpir. vini, ol. aniſi,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>In caſe the body be bruiſed by a Fall from on high, or any other way, the Patient is to be immediately let bloud, and the bruiſed Parts to be embroca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſome of the aboveſaid Repellents; or, if it may be had, lap him in a Sheep-skin flay'd quick off: and then you may preſcribe the common Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as a draught of <hi>Spruce</hi> Beer, or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>ſperm. ceti, Iriſh</hi> Slate, or ſuch like Powders; ℞ <hi>rhabarbari toſti, terrae ſigill. mumiae, an. p. aeq.</hi> The Doſe may be a dram in ſome proper Vehicle: and afterwards you may by Diſcutients in the form of Unguents or Cerots breath forth the remaining bruiſed Bloud.</p>

                     <p>A Perſon of about thirty years old,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> of a full Body, ſtepping into his Coach, his foot ſlipped, and he bruiſed his Shin upon the Foot-board. He returned to his Lodging, and purpoſed to ſend for a Chirurgeon: but in the while looking upon it, and ſeeing no skin broken, he was adviſed to bath it with <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> to rarefie the bloud and keep it circulating; a new way to make work for a Chirurgeon. He did ſo, and lapp'd it about with a cloath dipt in the ſame, continuing this way of Dreſſing ſome days. It growing daily leſs painfull, but the Swelling not going away, I was ſent for, and perceived indeed the black and blew colours to be in a great meaſure gone, but by their relation the Tumour was bigger: by which it was eaſie to judge of the great virtue of <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> ſo uſed. Whereas by Repellents at firſt with the expulſive Bandage the Bloud might have been reſtrained, and afterward what was extravaſated might have been eaſily diſcuſſed. Wee ſee it daily in our Practice, and cenſure thoſe of our Profeſſion who ſuffer ſuch Extravaſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in every little Tumour to corrupt.</p>
                     <p>In this Patient there was a Tumour of about a week's continuance: the queſtion was, whether what was contained in the Tumour was Bloud or Matter. If Matter, then a painfull Fluxion ſhould have preceded with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and hardneſs, and have terminated by Diſcuſſion or by Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereas this ſwelled and was painfull upon the blow, but was never hard nor inflamed, or much painfull, after the ſenſe of the ſtroak was over, but ſoft from the firſt night; and muſt conſequently be Bloud. But whether it were Bloud putrefied, or concocted Matter, there remained no hopes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing it; nor was it ſafe permitting it to lodge ſo near the Bone in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Therefore, without farther diſpute, I laid it open by Inciſion, and diſcharged about two ſpoonfulls of a corrupt black bloud and <hi>Serum;</hi> then dreſſed it up with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> and embrocated the Tumour with <hi>ol. chamaem.</hi> and applying an <hi>Emplaſt. ſtict. Paracelſ.</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage rowled it up. The third day after I dreſſed it again, fomenting it with the Decoction ſet down in the method of Cure, and deterged with <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dif. Paracelſi;</hi> and by the help of the Vitriol-ſtone and the common Sarco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,

                        <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> &amp;c. incarned and cicatrized it, but continued the Bandage a few days after, to ſtrengthen the Part.</p>

Here was an object of Charity, upon which account I was ſent to him. I found the out-ſide of his Leg ſwell'd and apoſtemated from the Gartering to the Small. I laid it open by Cauſtick an inch or two, according to the length of the Member. In dividing the Eſcar, there was diſcharged a large quantity of Matter with clotted bloud in it. I dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients, and embrocated the Parts affected <hi>cum. ol. roſ. &amp; vino auſtero,</hi> and applied <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> over the Tumour with Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The next day I brought a Decoction of <hi>abſinth. flor. cham. roſ. rubr. bacc. myrtill.</hi> fomented the Leg, and dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Suppuration; then by good Bandage thruſt out the Matter, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to agglutinate the hollow Parts; but could not doe it without laying it more open by a ſnip made with a Probe-ſciſſors. After which I deterged the Ulcer with the Vitriol-ſtone and with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum Merc. praecipitat.</hi> Then I incarned and cicatrized it, as hath been ſaid in the former Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>And old Gentleman was ſorely bruiſed by a Fall in ſeverall parts,<note place="margin">3.

After the ſpace of two months I was conſulted, and ſaw an <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> very hard and big lying along the Veſſels that reach on the inſide of the Arm to the Elbow-joynt. I embrocated <hi>cum oleo lumbricor. vulpin. &amp; guttis aliquot olei origani &amp; lavendulae,</hi> and applied <hi>cerat. agripp.</hi> over all. The next day I fomented with Diſcutients to which was added <hi>ſpir. vini.</hi> Then, having embrocated it as aboveſaid, I apply'd a Cataplaſm <hi>ex farinis hordei, orobi, lentium, ſem. foenugraeci, cum flor. chamaemeli, ſambuci,</hi> &amp;c. decocted in ſome of the former <hi>Fotus,</hi> with an addition of ſome of the aboveſaid Oyls and <hi>Oxymel ſcillitic.</hi> By which method the Swelling and <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> were ſcattered.</p>

It was embrocated <hi>cum oleo roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> and an <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> applied over the grieved Part. Venaeſection was propoſed, but not permitted, by reaſon of his age, not would he purge. The third day he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of extremity of pain, and ſuſpected his Hip luxated. I took off the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and felt the Joint well, but all that ſide of the Thigh over-ſpred with an <hi>Ecchymoſis.</hi> I embrocated with <hi>ol. chamaemel. &amp; lumbricor.</hi> with an addition of <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> and applied <hi>Empl. ſtict.

Some weeks after he complained of a nummedneſs of the whole Leg: upon which account Embrocations were repeated, alſo Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> &amp;c. with Antiſcorbuticks: but he took little of them. During this the Leg began to emaciate, and a Species of a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

Since his Fall he had been below ſtairs walking with Crutches, but of late did ſit up moſt part of the night, by reaſon of his pain. This and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Member had occaſioned the Swelling, and infeebled the native heat in the deſigned Fontanell. I cut into the Eſcar, dapt it <hi>cum oleo terebinth.</hi> hot, and fill'd it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> then dreſſed it with Pledgits applied warm out of a mixture of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> with ſome of the ſaid Oyl; after fomented the Leg with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein had been decocted ſome of the warm Plants, and apply'd a Cataplaſm over the Ulcer.

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of an</hi> Aneuriſma.</head>
                     <p>AN <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> according to my Deſcription, is an <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> and indeed the higheſt Species of it. But ſince Authours have given another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Tumour, and have allowed it a peculiar Chapter, I have done ſo too; the rather, becauſe the nature of the Veſſel through which the Effuſion is made doth require a different method of Cure.</p>
                     <p>It is a Tumour ſoft,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> white, and yielding to the touch, but riſeth again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the removall of your finger; and is for the moſt part accompanied with pulſation of the Artery.</p>
                     <p>It is raiſed,<note place="margin">Opinion of the Ancients.</note> according to the Opinion of Authours, by dilatation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Artery; they ſuppoſing the Bloud to have burſt its paſſage through the firſt Coat, and dilated the ſecond, thereby raiſing the Tumour. And this ſome of them have delivered to us ſo poſitively, as if they had in opening them found the exteriour Coat ſo dilated. This I my ſelf was taught, and ſome while believed: but not having been able by my Practice to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> made by dilatation or relaxation of the outward Coat, I am apt to believe that there is no ſuch thing, but that it takes its riſe from
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95669:44"/>Bloud burſting quite through the Artery into the interſtices of the Muſcles, where it raiſeth a Tumour ſuitable to the Cavity it findeth, growing bigger or leſs, of this or that ſhape, as the Muſcles give way. But this Tumour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Bloud extravaſated, the Artery lying undilated the while. I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſpect the poſſibility of an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> by the dilatation of the outward or ſofter Coat of the Artery, becauſe it ſeems improbable that a force big enough to burſt the inward Coat, which is ſo tough and firm, ſhould leave the exteriour, being ſofter and weaker, whole, and go out ſo leiſurely into it as to give it time for dilatation. Thoſe which I have met with did all come from downright eruption through both the Coats; and thoſe that come from external Punctures muſt of neceſſity begin with a breach of the external Coat firſt, it being next the Lancet, or other Weapon that made the diviſion. <hi>Sennertus</hi> would have it to heal again, though contrary to my experience, who have always found it open as well as the internal: and indeed reaſon muſt tell us, that the conſtant eruptions of bloud out of the Artery in every Pulſe muſt needs keep it open; nay, the Bloud keeps not within the bounds of any one Membrane, but I have ſeen it extravaſated through all the interſtices of the Muſcles of the whole Arm.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Aneuriſma</hi>'s are divers, internal, or external.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> 1. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe is, the impetuoſity of the Bloud, which moving with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in its Channels then the Artery can ſuſtain, doth force its way through the ſide of the Veſſel, and, burſting a hole in it, doth iſſue into the ſpace that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between it and the neighbouring Muſcles, there incraſſating the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Muſcles, and framing it ſelf a neſt.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Impetus</hi> may riſe firſt from the quantity of the Bloud. Either when it is more then the Veſſel can contain, a caſe that ſeldom happens to produce an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> in any conſpicuous Veſſel; but if any ſuch thing be, it opens at the Noſe, or Lungs, or in the Brain, (there cauſing an Apoplexy;) or in the Stomach, Guts, <hi>Anus,</hi> &amp;c. Or elſe when this Bloud is not really more then the whole Body naturally ſhould contain, but by violent Paſſion, or motion in ſtirring, is too forcibly driven forwards from the Heart towards ſome peculiar Artery; when the farther progreſs being (it may be) intercepted by ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contraction of the Muſcles through which it muſt paſs, it of neceſſity breaks the Veſſel: and thus in violent Vomiting and other Straining <hi>Aneuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſma's</hi> are often made in the Neck, Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, from the quality of the Bloud, which, being too ſharp or thin, crodes the Veſſel; or, being highly fermented by other cauſes, burſts through all.</p>
                     <p>This Bloud, though extravaſated, doth uſually pulſe: partly, becauſe the body of the Artery from which it breaks doth paſs through it, and by its Pulſe doth agitate that; and partly, becauſe in every ſuch Pulſe ſome addition of Bloud is made to the Tumour. Yet this Pulſe is chiefly in ſmall <hi>Aneuriſma's</hi> or ſuperficial ones; for in the greater the motion of the Artery is not alwaies felt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The external Cauſes are puncture by Lancet or Weapon, cutting, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, eroſion, or whatever elſe may divide the Coats of the Arteries.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> are either from its magnitude, ſituation,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> or ſhape. From the Magnitude it is denominated great or little, poſſeſſing the whole member or a part. From its Situation, it is ſuperficial near the Skin, or deep in the Muſcles. From its Shape: either it keeps the ſhape of the Part; which uſually happens when the Orifice in the Artery is ſmall, ſo that the Bloud comes out leiſurely, and finds the neighbour-Membranes ſo well united as to keep it within a certain channel, which Membranes are alſo fortified by an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95669:45"/>addition of a <hi>Serum</hi> coagulated from the extravaſated Bloud: or elſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters its form, when it groweth ſuddenly and irregularly, the Eruption being ſo great that it cannot be kept within bounds; or when it is by an ignorant Chirurgeon treated with Lenients and Diſcutients, being miſtaken for ſome other Diſeaſe; for in this caſe the Membrances are relaxed, and give way to the Tumour.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Differences the <hi>Signs</hi> of an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> may be taken.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> If the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be ſmall and ſuperficial, a Pulſation may eaſily be felt in every part of it. If it be great and riſe ſuddenly, and was white and ſoft from its firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though there be no Pulſation to be felt, yet you may conclude it an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma,</hi> there being not any Humour ſave that of Bloud which can ſo ſuddenly raiſe ſuch a Tumour. The often increaſe and diminution of the Tumour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Sign of an <hi>Aneuriſma;</hi> the diminution of it being the return of the Bloud into the Artery, whence it as often cometh out again.</p>
                     <p>If it happened from a Puncture of a Lancet, the manner of the ſpurting out of the Bloud will ſhew it: and if it do not bleed, yet a ſudden Tumour thruſts up under your Finger, with Pulſation, the bloud breaking out into the interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Muſcles, though not quite into the Skin.</p>
                     <p>The Tumour is more compact or ſcattered according as there was care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at firſt to reſtrain it within compaſs. In ſome of theſe there is redneſs and Inflammation, by reaſon of the expanſion of the Parts beyond their capacity, or from the putrefaction of the Bloud: in which latter caſe Fever and Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the moſt part accompany it.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Aneuriſma's</hi> are difficult of Cure.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> Thoſe which are large, and ariſe from Arteries deep in the Muſcles, to which you cannot make your Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are incurable: and if they be unadviſedly opened, the Patient is in great danger of his life. But if the <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> be in ſuch a Part as is capable of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and application of Medicaments, the Cure is feaſible; or the Diſeaſe may be palliated to the eaſe of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> conſiſts in the timely application of proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and Bandage to reſtrain the Bloud and keep it within its Channel: or by Eſcaroticks or the actual Cautery you may deſtroy it. But if it lie where you may take it up, the Cure is then beſt performed by dividing it. The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments proper to reſtrain it in its motion, and agglutinate the Veſſel, are, <hi>bol. Armen. ſang. dracon. thus, aloe, far. volat. gypſum;</hi> alſo the juices of <hi>plantag. burſ. paſtoris, millefol. vincae pervincae, piloſellae, lamii,</hi> and ſuch like. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds may be made of ſome of the foregoing Powders with ſome of the aforeſaid Juices, or mixt <hi>cum aceto &amp; albumin. ovorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt appearance of the Tumour, if it aroſe from an internal Cauſe, you ſhall endeavour by the application of ſome of the aforeſaid Aſtringents and Bandage to reſtrain the growth of it: but if it be in a place incapable of Bandage, you muſt content your ſelf with the application of <hi>Empl. Caeſaris,</hi> or ſuch like. If it be near the <hi>trachea Arteria,</hi> the Patient may wear beaten Lead or Gold upon it covered with Sarſenet or the like. You are to be well adviſed before you attempt the Cure by opening it. If by putrefaction the Bloud burſt forth ſuddenly upon you, the life of your Patient is then in danger, and it will become you to be quick in the application of good Reſtrictives and Bandage, till you have time to conſider what to doe: and be ſure to provide againſt the next Eruption; for till it break of it ſelf you are not to open it; and then you may attempt the ſtopping of the Flux by ſuch means as have been or hereafter ſhall be propoſed.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> happen by Puncture in letting bloud, the Chirurgeon ought to permit the Veſſel opened to bleed freely: but if it doth not bleed well,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95669:45"/>let him immediately looſen the Bandage, and apply a Compreſs dipt in his <hi>MAJESTY</hi>'s Stiptick, or, for want of it, in <hi>Oxyerate.</hi> Let it be held firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Apertion by a Servant, whilſt the Chirurgeon openeth a Vein in the other Arm, and maketh Revulſion by a large evacuation to fainting, if it may be permitted. The while let your aſtringent Powders be applied to the Wound, with good reſtrictive Emplaſters over them. The upper part of the Arm to the <hi>Axilla</hi> is to be defended by cloaths wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate.</hi> Then with a Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with two heads take two or three turns upon the diſeaſed Part, and rowl upward, (his Arm being bowed the while:) and, for more ſecurity, take a turn about the Neck, and return back with your Bandage gradually to the Part affected, faſtening it on the outſide; then make the expulſive Bandage from the Hand upward. Theſe ought to be made to the eaſe of the Patient, who, being thus dreſt, muſt be put into his bed, and his Hand placed upon his Breaſt. Contemperating Juleps, Emulſions, Opiats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, and his Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be regulated as is propoſed in the Chapt. of the <hi>Wounds of the Veins and Arteries.</hi> Having made this Bandage well, you are not to be over-haſty in opening it again; for this firſt Dreſſing haply ſecures your Patient. For the great miſchief happening in theſe <hi>Aneuriſma's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the ignorance of the Bloud-letter, who, not conſidering the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by him committed in letting bloud, binds up the Arm careleſly, and the next day, upon the Patient's complaint, not diſcovering the cauſe of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, foments and embrocates it, thereby making way for the Bloud to empty it ſelf into the interſtices of the Muſcles; whereupon the whole Arm ſwelleth. In which caſe a laced Sleeve and Glove may be of great uſe. When this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod fails, it may be neceſſary that you prepare for Deligation of the Artery. The manner of doing it you may ſee in the Chapter of <hi>the Wounds of the Veins and Arteries.</hi> I ſhall alſo ſhew it in one of the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I Have had many brought to me with ſwelled Necks,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Aneuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſma's</hi> lying near the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea Arteria.</hi>

In which caſes I commonly propoſed the wearing of a Cap of beaten Lead made of many ſheets laid upon one another, and covered with Silk or Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenet, which with Ribbons were made to faſten about the Neck with much eaſe: or, if they would have Emplaſters, I applied ſome of a mixture of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. ſumach</hi> with <hi>Empl. Caeſaris,</hi> or ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Where <hi>Aneuriſma's</hi> have affected Parts capable of Bandage, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time palliated them: but when they would not be ſo quieted, I proſecuted the Cure as followeth.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about 40 years of age,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma.</hi>
                        </note> having ſome time been troubled with a large ſoft Tumour on the inſide of his right Leg about his Gartering, deſired my advice. It was without Pain, Inflammation or Pulſation, but ſoft from its firſt appearance, and was bigger or leſſer according as he walked much or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; which gave me ſuſpicion it might be an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi> I applied <hi>Empl. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaris</hi> over it, cauſed a laced Stocking to be put on, let him bloud, and adviſed to Purging, regulation of Diet and Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it was kept quiet ſome time. But he, growing more ſecure, neglected the Rules preſcribed him; whereupon the Tumour encreaſed, and burſt forth one night in a flux of Bloud. I was ſent for, and found much extravaſated; but the Opening it ſelf was ſtopt with a clot of grumous bloud. I dreſſed it up with Reſtrictives and Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate.</hi> Then I made Revulſion by Venaeſection and Deligation of other Parts. I alſo preſcribed Opiats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to calm the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95669:46"/>in the Bloud. By this and my way of dreſſing the Bloud was for ſome days tolerably reſtrain'd: but as the Opening grew bigger, the effuſion was greater. Upon which conſideration I had provided ſome <hi>trochiſci de minio</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſizes, alſo ſome <hi>pulv. ſine pari Jo. Arden.</hi> I put in ſome of the former, and applied my Reſtrictives and Bandage over the Tumour; and, as often as the Bloud burſt forth, I continued that way of dreſſing, hoping by thoſe Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roticks to deſtroy the Artery. Afterwards the Orifice growing larger, I filled up the Abſceſs with the <hi>pulv. ſine pari</hi> upon Doſſills, and applied Reſtrictives and Bandage as before. The Patient grew daily weaker; but from this latter Dreſſing the Bleeding was reſtrained till the fifth day, when I was neceſſitated to open it, by reaſon of the Excoriations made in many places about it by the Eſcaroticks: nor was it then much. The Opening being large, I applied the Eſcaroticks to more advantage, and dreſſed the Excoriations with <hi>unguent. album camphorat.</hi> continuing my <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> and Bandage. From that time the Bleeding was ſtopped, I ſuppoſe by conſuming the Artery; yet for ſome while there came away much ſtinking clotted Bloud. While I endeavoured to keep the Bloud within the Abſceſs, it inſinuated between the Muſcles, making the Calf of the leg hollow to the very Tendon: therefore, after I was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Bleeding, I made way for the eaſie diſcharge of Matter, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Abſceſs with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> To the Excoriations I continued the uſe of Epuloticks, and nouriſhed my Patient with good Broths, Caudles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which he recovered ſtrength apace. The ſharp Humours being evacuated with his Bloud, the Abſceſs incarned by the application of the common Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks, and he was cured in leſs then a month, recovering alſo the perfect uſe of his Leg.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince I was deſired to give a viſit to a man lying in my way to <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> He had a large white Tumour poſſeſſing the fore-part of his right Thigh of few months growth: it was ſoft from the firſt appearance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Patient to be bigger and leſſer one time then another. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Swelling, and concluded it an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi> That there was no Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to be felt in it, was becauſe it lay deep amongſt the Muſcles, in which caſe the Pulſe is frequently intercepted. There lay a gummy Emplaſter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and an attempt had been made to open it by Cauſtick; but it not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating deep enough, the Eſcar ſeparated without reaching near the Cavity. I declared to the Patient my thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Swelling proceeded from Bloud poured forth of its Veſſels, either by Eroſion from within, or by ſome outward cauſe, as by Riding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adviſed him not to permit the Tumour to be opened, deſiring that, if his Chirurgeon ſhould perſiſt in the ſuppurating or opening of it, he would ſend to me to meet him. Some few days after the Patient ſent me notice that his Chirurgeon had been with him, and reſolved to open it: whereupon I took the next opportunity to ſpeak with the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and went along with him to his Patient; where I endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that the Swelling aroſe from Bloud, and withall propoſed a pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cure by a laced Trowze and ſome good Reſtrictive. But the Chirurgeon declared himſelf poſitively for the opening of it. I, ſeeing his reſolution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Since you are ſo opinionated, you may (if you think good) make a triall of the Tumour by thruſting a ſmall Lancet directly into the middle of it; and if upon pulling out of the Lancet it appear mattery, you may lay it more open; if it appear bloudy, you may more eaſily cure it then one made by a Cauſtick. He readily aſſented to the trial, and the Patient rejoycing in the propoſal, he attempted it with a Lancet: but not thruſting it deep enough to reach the Cavity, I took the Lancet, and, paſſing it into the ſame Opening he had made, thruſt it directly down into the Cavity, and pulled it out bloudy,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95669:46"/>but not one drop followed it. The Chirurgeon not being therewith ſatisfied, I wiſhed him to paſs a ſmall Probe down into the Opening. He did ſo: and I alſo made a ſearch with the ſame Probe, and felt the Cavity large and full of Liquids, which was certainly Bloud, the Probe coming out bloudy. I perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Patient to keep his bed till that Puncture ſhould be agglutinated, and adviſed the Chirurgeon to be carefull in the Cure of it. We dreſſed it with a Pledgit of <hi>liniment. Arcaei,</hi> with Emplaſter and Bandage: to the uſe of which Medicine I left them, not doubting of their care in healing up ſo ſmall a Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. About ten days after, walking near the door in a dark evening weary, and deſirous to reſt my ſelf, the thoughts of this poor man enclined me to go into the houſe. I enquired of the Land-lady if he was within. She replied, He is dying: That upon his riſing out of his bed the Bloud had burſt forth exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively: That the Chirurgeon had for ſome days endeavoured to ſtop it, but had ſince left the Patient, and a Neighbour-woman had applied a Pultice to it; and that the Chamber ſtunk ſo extreamly as it would poiſon me to go into it. I went up, and found the room ſcattered with ſtinking bloudy Cloaths, and the poor man languiſhing in his bed, which was not cleanlier. I ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently away for the Chirurgeon, and in the while made Rowlers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, and ſent for ſome Yeaſt and Wheat-flower. The Chirurgeon being come, we ſpred a mixture of them upon cloaths, and armed ſeveral Tents with the ſame. Having thus prepared our Dreſſings as the time would permit, we took off the bloudy ones, and held the Orifice cloſe while we cleanſed the Thigh from the Pultice and Bloud, then ſtopped the Orifice with a Tent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and applied our Agglutinatives over, with Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate.</hi> We rowled the Member moderately ſtraight, then laid him clean, and cauſed a meſs of Caudle to be given him, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him with hopes of recovery. The Chirurgeon pleaded for himſelf, that he thought the Patient had been dead.</p>
                     <p>Three or four days after we dreſſed him again, and found him much recrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Spirits, he not having bled one drop: and indeed the Emplaſters adhered as cloſe to the Skin as we could deſire. After we had taken out the Tent, abundance of grumous Bloud iſſued forth: we cleanſed it away, and ſhaked into the Abſceſs about a dram of <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and though we had then choice of Medicaments, yet we applied the ſame as before, and continued that method of Dreſſings, till the Bloud was converted to Matter. Then we ſlit open the Orifice, and dreſſed it as a ſinuous Ulcer. After ſome days, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Matter could not diſcharge while he kept his bed till the Abſceſs was full to run over, we cauſed him to riſe out of it: but that little while he was up he ſwouned; wherefore we put him to bed again, and allowed him ſtronger nouriſhment, and by a Seton-needle made way for the diſcharge of Matter to more advantage. The Abſceſs being well diſpoſed to cure, I left him again to his Chirurgeon, who cured him.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment of opening <hi>Aneuriſma's</hi> by Puncture is not to be imitated, unleſs it be in ſuch caſes as this, where both Patient and Chirurgeon are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince, while I dwelt in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> I was conſulted in the caſe of a man who in his letting bloud was pricked in the Artery. The Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did not bleed outwardly, but diſcharged it ſelf between the Muſcles. The Tumour, being miſtaken for a puncture of a Nerve or Tendon, was fomented with Diſcutients, whereby I found it much inlarged, and not onely the inſide but the outſide of the Arm ſwelled above and beneath the Elbow, with a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in thoſe remote Parts. I cauſed an Emplaſter to be made of ſome of the Reſtrictives ſet down in the method of Cure, <hi>cum ol. roſ. myrtill. &amp; aceto,</hi> and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95669:47"/>applied it over the Arm to the <hi>Axilla</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage. I then let him bloud, and diſpoſed him to reſt with an Anodyne draught, and preſcribed him Emulſions and cooling Juleps, with ſuch a Diet as might incraſſate his Bloud. A day or two after I ſtrengthened the former Bandage by a laced Sleeve and Glove, by which for ſome time much of the Bloud was returned back into the Artery, and the Arm ſeemed in a hopefull way of recovery: but through irregularity the Arm ſwelled again, and the Patient grew weary of us, and gave ear to every prattle; and ſo it happened that an Empirick was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, as having an excellent Medicament to ſtop Bleeding. He was fetcht, and undertook the Cure, and removed the Patient nearer his Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where he treated him: but he being ignorant in making the Bandage, or poſſibly not thinking it ſo neceſſary, the Arm ſwelled; and the Tumour on the inſide of the Arm being ſoft and prominent, he concluded it <hi>a bag of Matter,</hi> (as he called it) and applied a few bruiſed Herbs to it, which eat into the Skin, and made way for the Bloud to burſt forth abundantly; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a neighbouring Chirurgeon was ſent for, and he called others, who together made a ſhift to ſtop it at that time. But his Arm gangrened, ſo that within few days after they prepared for the cutting it off. The Patient's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, being acquainted with the accident, ſent me to them. I ſaw it ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and the Patient put into his bed. We ſlit up the Arm, and laid the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery bare. It retained its natural ſhape and ſmalneſs, not one jot dilated; nor was the Apertion conſiderable which had been made by that accident, but by reaſon of its conſtitution continued open, as I have ſeen a hole punched in Leather, whereby it was capable of receiving the Bloud, if it had been time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned: but that being omitted, the extravaſated Bloud forced amongſt the interſtices of the Muſcles up to the <hi>Axilla,</hi> and on the outſide of the Arm down beneath the Elbow, in which places we found a quantity of ſtinking grumous Bloud.</p>
                     <p>A Man being much afflicted with a Tumour in his right Arm,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> occaſioned by the pricking of an Artery in letting bloud, having tried the endeavours of ſeveral of our Profeſſion unſucceſsfully, ſome whereof had purpoſed the taking off this Arm, at the laſt I was ſent for, and met Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> there. Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> was his Chirurgeon. The Tumour was large, much inflamed, and painfull, with little or no Pulſation: but the Accident which gave riſe to the Tumour enough confirmed it an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi> My opinion was, that a Tumour ſo inflamed was not capable of ſuch Bandage whereby they might hope to return the Bloud back into the Artery. Nor indeed was it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe that ſuch a putrefactive heat as ſeemed to be incloſed in that Swelling was capable of being thruſt back or retained long there, without making its own way by a Gangrene: and of what danger ſuch an Eruption might be to the Patient, if a Chirurgeon were not at hand, I left to their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Then in order to the removal of the Tumour there were but two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Amputation of the Arm, or cutting into the Tumour, and making Deligation of the Artery; which latter I commended to them. They aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Deligation: onely the Patient deſired a day or two to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. We applied <hi>Empl. è bolo,</hi> with a moderate Bandage to reſtrain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Tumour the while. The fourth day after we met again, and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things ready, the Patient was placed in a Chair towards the light. I took off the Dreſſings, and made a Ligature four fingers breadth above the Tumour, on which Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> made a gripe. Some other held the Hand and lower part of the Arm, whilſt I made Inciſion down the length of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. That done, I threw out the grumous Bloud with my fingers, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Wound with a Sponge. Then deſiring Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> to ſlacken his hand,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95669:47"/>upon which the Artery diſcovered it ſelf by the bloud ſpurting out, I paſſed my Needle under the upper part of the Artery, and tied that, and cut off the end of the Ligature. Near the Wound made in the Artery by letting bloud there was a cartilaginous body formed, which hindred my coming to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; I cut it away, then paſſed my Needle, and made a ſecond Ligature. We dreſſed it up with Pledgits ſpred with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> dipt <hi>in pulv. Galeni,</hi> and applied <hi>Empl. diachalcit.</hi> malaxed with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and rowled it up to the eaſe of the Patient; then put him into his bed, and preſcribed him an Anodyne draught to take that night. The next day I viſited him, and found him in much eaſe: he had ſlept well with half the draught was deſigned him, and was not troubled with thoſe fainting fits which he had been ſubject to before the Operation. The third day we took him out of his bed to dreſs his Arm. In taking off the Dreſſing we found all ſafe, and the Lips of the wound tending to digeſtion. Mr. <hi>Hollier,</hi> who held the Arm above, ſeeing no Bloud flow from the Wound, for experience ſake griped it harder: upon which the Bloud of a ſudden dropped from the fleſhy parts and Capillaries in great drops, as if it had been preſſed out of a Sponge. I wondered at the manner of its bleeding, not minding what he had done: but he ſlackning his hand, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as ſoon.<note place="margin">Caution.</note> Which may ſhew the ill conſequence of over-hard binding in the dreſſing of Wounds, Ulcers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We dreſſed the Wound with the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive as before, and ſo continued it till the Wound was well digeſted. From that time we dreſſed it with Sarcoticks, rubbed the looſe fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, and haſtened the cicatrizing of it with <hi>aq. medicamentoſ.</hi> &amp;c. I ſaw the Ligatures fall off, and the Wound cicatrizing, then left it to his Chirurgeon, it being at that time indeed almoſt cicatrized. The Patient made me a viſit a while after, and ſhewed me that he could uſe that Arm as well as the other.</p>

                     <p>There are three Species of them,<note place="margin">3. Species.</note> differing from each other according to the Humour of which they are generated. The firſt is the <hi>Simple Herpes,</hi> proceeding from pure Choler. The ſecond is the <hi>Herpes miliaris,</hi> wherein there is an admixture of a ſalt wateriſh Humour. The third Species is <hi>Herpes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> where the Humour added to the <hi>Bilis</hi> partaketh of much acrimony, and proves exceeding corroſive.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Simple Herpes</hi> is a Puſtule of a yellowiſh inflamed colour with a ſharp head: it cometh ſoon to maturity,<note place="margin">Simple Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</note> and the Matter is viſible in the upper part of it whilſt its <hi>baſis</hi> is inflamed; but in the eruption of the Matter the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation goeth off, and it healeth. In the Face they frequently appear ſingle,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95669:48"/>and ſo they will in other parts of the body, and are generally taken notice of as cholerick Puſtules: but they do often appear over-ſpreading the Back, Sides, or Breaſt, and are accompanied with an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> and have a Fever joined with them; being in this caſe known by the name of <hi>Shingles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Herpes miliaris</hi> riſeth in a cluſter of ſmall Wheals little differing from the colour of the Skin.<note place="margin">Herpes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaris.</note> They are firſt diſcovered by their itching, and being rubbed or ſcratched they weep a thin wateriſh Humour: from that time a Scab appeareth in the head of each of them of the form of a Millet-ſeed, from whence the Tumour hath its name. As the Puſtules heal in one place, they uſually break out in another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> is ſaid to be rather an Ulcer then a Tumour,<note place="margin">Herpes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> but is indeed an Ulcer with Tumour, it riſing in the Skin in a ſmall Tubercle, on the top whereof there appeareth an Ulcer like a pin-hole. It is for the moſt part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inflammation or pain. When it ariſeth alone it is ſcarce taken notice of, it mattering but little unleſs it be picked, and then it ſcabs ſoon after with a thin Scurf. But in progreſs of time it ſheweth its ill condition, by eating away the Skin, and indurates the Fleſh underneath and Parts about. Sometime I have ſeen theſe Ulcers ariſe in the Skin ſomewhat diſtant one from another, making an unequal furrow; as from the upper Lip by the Noſtril creeping to that ſide of the Noſe, ſo to the ridge of it, and down again to that corner of the Eye; healing in ſome places while it eat deep into the fleſh in others.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Herpes</hi> in <hi>Lues venerea</hi> frequently ariſeth from a <hi>Simple Herpes,</hi> while the Matter is ſhut in by the Scab, it corroding underneath, and making an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; when it breaketh out, appearing like a Hony-comb, bigger or leſs, and of a round or long figure, accordingly as the Diſeaſe hath more or leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Simple Herpes</hi> is neither dangerous,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> nor difficult of cure; but in the Face it may be exaſperated by picking or ſcratching, and grow corroſive; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will heal of it ſelf. When it firſt overſpreads a Part, the Patient is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with Fever; but as it cometh to Matter, that indiſpoſition goeth off.</p>
                     <p>As an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> doth ſometime terminate in a <hi>Herpes,</hi> ſo an <hi>Herpes</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently accompanied by an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Herpes miliaris</hi> is without Fever, but is difficult of Cure, eſpecially if it affect the Face, Noſe or Ears. If the Cure be neglected, it eateth deep into the Fleſh; and then, in what Part ſo ever it is, the Cure is hard to accompliſh.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> is moſt difficult of cure, and if it be not timely treated, it certainly terminates in a <hi>Phagedaena</hi> of Cancer: but when it ariſeth from <hi>Lues venerea,</hi> the very worſt is curable.</p>
                     <p>As to Internal Remedies;<note place="margin">Cure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> a <hi>Simple Herpes</hi> is cured much like an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> by evacuation and contemperation of choler. <hi>Herpes miliaris</hi> cometh near to the nature of an Itch, and is to be treated with Purgatives and Alteratives much of the ſame kinde with what is propoſed for that.

                     <p>A Girl of about ſix years of age was brought to me with many ſmall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Wheals riſing behind her left Ear and down that ſide of her Neck towards that Clavicle, with an Inflammation about them.<note place="margin">1.

I opened them all, and diſcharged the Matter, then dreſſed them with <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> upon Pledgits of Lint; by which in three or four days after they were dried up and cured.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about fifty years old, through ſome diſorder in Diet,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an <hi>Herpes.</hi>
                        </note> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Bloud, and was indiſpoſed with a Cough and Shortneſs of breath: he had alſo many Puſtules riſen upon his Breaſt, Back, and Sides, with an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation partaking of an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> I let him bloud about ten ounces, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him a Clyſter, alſo a pectoral Ptiſan, and adviſed him to forbear ſtrong drinks, and to make his diet of Water-grewell, Panado, and the like. I ſent him ſome of my lenient Cerote to apply, in caſe any of the Puſtules ſhould matter and ſtick to his linnen. Three or four days after they came to maturity, and brake, and dried as the former: while they dried he was purged with Whey and Manna, and a few days after was well and abroad.</p>

The next day I purged her with an opening A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozeme, ſuch as is propoſed in the Chapter of the <hi>Itch;</hi> which ſhe repeated often. The day after her firſt Purge I looked upon her Hand, and, finding it all mattery, bathed it with a Decoction of <hi>polygonum, ſummitat. equiſeti, rubi,</hi> &amp;c. then dipt cloaths in ſome of the ſame, and rowled up each Finger by it ſelf, leaving a ſpace here and there between, on which I applied Pledgits ſpred with <hi>unguent. de lithargyro.</hi> I dreſſed up the Hand after the ſame method, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to renew the Dreſſings thrice aday. By this and other drying waters it cicatrized here and there; but then an Inflammation aroſe above the Wriſt with many Wheals. Upon the ſight of which I gave her ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> over night,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95669:49"/>and a draught of her purging Apozeme in the morning.

                        </note> of a full Body abounding with ſharp Humours, was ſeized with an <hi>Herpes</hi> on his right Leg. I dreſſed it with a mixture of <hi>unguent. nutritum</hi> and <hi>populeon,</hi> and propoſed Bleeding and Purging: but we being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a march, our lying in the fields the nights and marching all day was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſuch Rules; whereupon it inflamed and ſwelled very much, many Wheals aroſe, and fretted one into another, with great Excoriation. I fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Leg in the mornings, and ſometime in the evening, (as we had time) with a Decoction of <hi>polygonum, plantag. equiſet. flor, roſ. rubr.</hi> and dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. album camphorat. cum albumine ovi,</hi> with an addition of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. tutiae</hi> ſpred upon little pieces of Linen, and laid on at ſuch diſtance as the Matter might get out between, then rowled on a Compreſs preſt out of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. But the Fluxion was ſo great, and the Matter ſo very ſharp, that for a while it would yield to no Applications. But after he had the conveniency of a Coach to reſt his Leg, I made a ſhift to cicatrize the Ulcerations by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bits of Linen dipt in the aforeſaid Decoction, and laying Pledgits ſpred with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. upon the edges of the Ulcerations over the Linen, with Compreſſes and Bandage.

                     <p>One came to me having an extream itching in the Palm of one of his hands.<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of <hi>Herpes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaris.</hi>
                        </note> I looked upon it, and ſaw many ſmall white Wheals ſcarce diſcernable: thoſe which he had ſcratched had ſmall Scabs on the heads of each one of them like Millet-ſeed: they ſeemed dry, but were encompaſſed alſo with Wheals, and did all itch very much. He had alſo ſomewhat of the ſame <hi>Herpes</hi> on his Thumb and Fore-finger of the other hand. I purged him with <hi>pulv. cornach.</hi> and ſent him a pot of the <hi>unguent. calcis</hi> preſcribed in the method of Cure to dreſs them with. I afterwards purged him with <hi>pulv. cornach.</hi> and <hi>Merc. dulcis:</hi> by which, and the addition of a few grains of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> to the aforeſaid Unguent, the <hi>Herpes</hi> was dried up in the ſeveral Parts.</p>

                        </note> It was an unequal dry Ulcer, eating into the Skin to the Fleſh of the compaſs of Half a crown: it was not much painfull or inflamed, otherwiſe then as ſhe heat it by walking on it.

The third day after, when I thought to have ſeen a deep Ulcer, I found it flat and dry, and, ſcraping off the Ointment, I alſo brought off the Slough, and ſaw the Skin ſmooth and even perfectly well: by which it was evident that the Diſeaſe was onely in the Skin.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95669:49"/>her Hair. Her often ſcratching it had exaſperated it, and the ſharp Humour which iſſued from it had fretted the Skin behind her Ear downward, and in progreſs of time that became ſerpiginous, and was, when I ſaw it, covered with white branny Scales. The Humour dropping down from theſe had then inflamed the Parts beneath, and many fiery <hi>Puſtulae</hi> were there riſen, which ſpred down to that Clavicle. I dreſſed theſe latter with <hi>cerat.

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of an</hi> Oedema.</head>
                     <p>HAving ſhewed you how <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Choler</hi> become offenſive when diſturbed and thrown out of their proper Sphere, I ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of that Tumour which hath its riſe from the <hi>Pituita</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and is known by the name of <hi>Oedema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a ſoft cold Tumour without change of colour, pulſation, heat or pain,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> unleſs it be from the diſtenſion of the Part it affects.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Oedema</hi> is, as in other preternatural Tumours, Antecedent,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> and Conjunct.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent Cauſe are either remote, as default in Diet, Air, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo old Contuſions, Luxations, Fractures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or more immediate, as the pituitous Humour abounding in the Body.</p>
                     <p>The Conjunct Cauſe is the ſame Humour collected into a Tumour, which is done for the moſt part by Congeſtion, theſe cold Tumours being rarely made by Fluxion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oedema</hi> in it ſelf is not dangerous;<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> people of groſs bodies and good fellows are frequently ſubject to them, yet live to old age. But in Conſumptive and Hydropical bodies it is of ill conſequence, not as it is a Diſeaſe, but as it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhews a decay of native heat. Thoſe <hi>Oedemata</hi> that attend accidents of Wounds, Fracture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not dangerous, nor difficult to cure: but if an <hi>Oedema</hi> grow hard and painfull, there is fear of a <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> or if it ſuppurate, of a long and tedious Cure.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of an <hi>Oedema</hi> three things are required: firſt,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> preventing the generation of the pituitous Matter; ſecondly, evacuating the groſs Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that abound in the body, which is the immediate Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; thirdly, the Cure of the Tumour it ſelf, which is effected by external Remedies.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:95669:50"/>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is performed by regulating the Patient in his manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; as in Diet, Air, Exerciſe, Sleeping, Watching, Paſſions of the mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As, that his Bread be of pure Wheat, well baked with Correctives, as Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Fenell, or Aniſe-ſeeds: that his Meat be Fleſh of good nouriſhment and eaſie digeſtion, Mutton, Veal, Pullet, Rabbit, Chicken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that his Drink be Ale well boiled and medicated. Wine is alſo commended; but moderation in drinking is deſired. The Air ought to be dry and heating, the very removal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hotter Countries being often the Cure of this Diſeaſe. Exerciſe is required, to ſtir up the native heat, and to waſt the Crudities. Sleep in the day-time is forbidden, and ought to be moderated in the night. Melancholy is to be avoided, and Venery if the Body be weak.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond conſiſts in preſcribing ſuch Remedies as may attenuate, open Obſtructions, and evacuate the pituitous Humour.

                     <p>The third concerneth the handling of the Tumour it ſelf: and that varies, according as it is in its beginning, ſtate, or declination.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning, the Medicaments may be ſuch as do moderately repell, not violently, leſt the Humour of which the Tumour proceedeth, being for the moſt part groſs, be thereby made more tough: beſides, Repellents are not ſo proper in congeſted Tumours. When we uſe them, it is rather to ſtrengthen the Part, then to repell; therefore we mix with them ſuch as have an attenuating
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95669:50"/>and diſcutient faculty. One of the milder is Bay-ſalt with Oyl of Olives. In ſmall Swellings proceeding from the weakneſs of the Part Brandy-wine, or a Solution of Bay-ſalt in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, or the Partie's own Urine, may ſerve ſufficiently to attenuate and dry up the humidity, and ſtrengthen the Part.</p>

                     <p>Bandage is of great help in the Cure of theſe pituitous Swellings: indeed we can doe nothing conſiderable without them. Thoſe I eſpecially recommend to you are the laced Stocking, Trowze, Sleeve and Glove. They, as ſitting moſt firmly, may be worn with the greateſt advantage, and with the leaſt trouble or prejudice to the health of the Patient; yet do they require your conſideration and care how they be laced: for by the unequall hard lacing of them you may raiſe a Tumour, and by an equal over-ſtreight lacing you may emaciate the moſt fleſhy Leg. Many inſtances may be given of the former, and I ſhall give you one of the latter.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of a ſedentary life, who had been vexed with an Ulcer in one of his Legs, was adviſed by his Chirurgeon to wear a laced Stocking; and having thereby cured the Ulcer, he thought fit to continue the uſe of the Stocking ſome while, which he did: but, minding more his Study then his Leg, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Stocking every morning ſtreighter, till his Leg became ſo weak that it could ſcarce ſupport his body. I was fetched, and ſurprized to ſee his Leg ſo dwindled away, wondering how he could lace it ſo ſmall without cauſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, or indeed ſuffer it to be ſo extenuated without taking more timely notice of it. I preſently cauſed the Stocking to be unlaced, and his Leg to be bathed with warm water, and embrocated with <hi>ol. lumbricor.</hi> by which it plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped again in few days, and recovered its former ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about thirty years of age,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a ſwelled Hand.</note> having laboured long of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague, was afflicted with a phlegmatick Swelling in his right Hand from the Fingers ends to the Arm, as full as the Skin could hold, both back and palm, the Joints ſtiff and uſeleſs. The Tumour was painfull by reaſon of the great diſtenſion of Parts, and was thereby rendred hard, yet yielded to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of my Fingers. Doctour <hi>Lenthall</hi> had purged him frequently; but the Tumour not yielding thereto, he put him into my hands. I began my work with the milder Fomentation preſcribed in the method of Cure, and embroca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95669:51"/>it with <hi>ol. cham. &amp; rutac. cum ſale comm.</hi> applied over the whole Swelling <hi>Emplaſtr. diaſulphuris,</hi> rowled it up, and placed it high up to his Breaſt. I continued this method ſome days without much advantage, then left off the uſe of the Emplaſter, and applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex faer. hordei,</hi> &amp;c. as it is ſet down in the method of Cure, and continued the Fomentation and Embrocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by the uſe of which the Tumour did ſomewhat diſcuſs. But, according to my long Obſervance, theſe crude Tumours cannot throughly diſcuſs without the help of a more ſtrict Bandage; therefore, having thus diſpoſed them for Bandage, I cauſed a Glove to be made of ſtrong Leather, ſlitting the back and fingers, and making Eylet-holes to draw it cloſe. Then having applied the Cerote above preſcribed, with a Compreſs of cloath over it, and a piece of Vellum to defend the Hand from the Lace, I laced the Glove on moderately ſtreight to the eaſe of the Patient, and ſtreightned it ſtill daily. But from that time I did not dreſs the Hand more then once in four or five days, and then I fomented and dreſſed it as I had done before, laying Compreſſes upon the Palm of the hand and elſewhere as I ſaw occaſion. As the Swelling diminiſhed the Glove became too big; we therefore put on another leſs, and began again to purge him, and preſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lign. guaiaci,</hi> &amp;c. and from that time we purged him once a week with <hi>extract. rudii &amp; calomel.</hi> By this method I diſcuſſed this Tumour in the midſt of Winter, he not keeping his Chamber but when he took Phyſick: yet there remained a ſtifneſs in the Joints of the Wriſt and Fingers, and the Arm was extremely emaciated. For the nouriſhing of it I made a Fontanel in that Arm; and in order to the relaxation of the ſtifneſs of the Joints of his Hand, I fomented them with emollient Herbs boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Fleſh-broth, and embrocated them daily with <hi>ol. lumbricor.</hi> applying a Cerote of <hi>unguent. dialthaeae</hi> and Wax over all. His Hand was alſo ſometimes put into Grains or a Beaſt's Belly. After which we dreſſed his Hand, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the Glove, as before we were accuſtomed to doe, and directed him to wear a furred Glove to keep it warm. By this method his Arm grew fat, and his Hand flexible and ſtrong before <hi>March.</hi>

                     <p>A Widow-woman aged fifty ſix years,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of ſwelled Legs.</note> of a groſs Body, having been long ſubject to Swellings in her Legs and Feet, was at laſt thereby confined to her Bed. They were pituitous, and yielded to the impreſſion of my fingers; yet were hard, and ſomewhat inflamed, and painfull: which latter was occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I ſuppoſe, from the extraordinary influx of Humour. I purpoſed to have begun my Cure with Purgatives: but ſhe, having no uſe of her Legs, would not be perſwaded to Phyſick. I fomented her Legs and Feet one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the milder <hi>Fotus</hi> preſcribed in the method of Cure, embrocated them with <hi>ol. cham. lilior. cum aceto,</hi> and applied a Cerote of <hi>unguent. dialth.</hi> with an addition of Wax, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. of <hi>ol. cham. chymic.</hi> with good Bandage from the Toes to the Knee. I repeated this way of Dreſſing twice aday, till I had mollified and reſolved ſomewhat of the Tumour and hardneſs; then made the Fomentation more diſcutient by the addition of Salt and <hi>Sulphur viv.</hi> and ſome days after cauſed a pair of laced Stockings to be put on, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them daily ſtreighter. But from that time I dreſſed her Legs but once in three or four days, unleſs it were that the Skin were fretted by the Salts or her ſcratching them. In which caſe I took them off, and bathed her Legs with warm water, and applied <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> on them. Thus her Feet and Legs were made leſs, and her Stockings taken in accordingly, till the Swellings were quite diſcuſt, and her Legs and Feet reſtored to their true ſhape, which was in leſs then eight weeks; during which I purged her with that Apozeme preſcribed in the method of Cure, and made her Fontanels in her Legs, and continued the uſe of the laced Stockings. I thought this Widow had been dead, till the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95669:51"/>laſt Summer ſhe ſent to me for an Emplaſter for a pain in her Shoulder; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the year 59. in which I cured her.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour about fifty years of age, of a corpulent full Body,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of ſwelled Legs. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> whom I had ſeen many years before in <hi>France</hi> afflicted with pituitous Swellings in his Legs and Feet, came over into <hi>England,</hi> and put himſelf into the hands of Sir <hi>Fr. Prujean,</hi> he then labouring under a complication of Diſeaſes, of which thoſe Swellings in his Legs and Feet were onely a Symptome. By Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybiats and Antiſcorbuticks he was relieved, and reſtored to a tolerable good health; but thoſe Swellings in his Legs did not leſſen. Upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I was ſent for, and propoſed the laced Stockings as the onely remedy. It being allowed of by the Phyſician, I fomented his Legs with the milder Fomentation above preſcribed, embrocated them as above faid in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Obſervation, and rowled them up from the Feet above the Knees. After three or four days I put him on laced Stockings with Knee-pieces, and by a moderate lacing of them reſtored the Legs and Feet to a better ſhape then they had been in many years before, and he injoyed a better health. After the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them ſome months longer, his Legs grew ſo well, that he frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued the uſe of them many months: yet when he perceived any fulneſs in them, he did put them on again, without adviſing us about it. Nine years after this Perſon was diſeaſed with a Carbuncle: after the Curing whereof his Legs, Thighs and Belly ſwelled extraordinarily. By Purging and Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks his Belly ſunk; and by laced Stockings and Trowzers the Swellings in his Legs and Thighs went off, and they continued well without farther uſe of the laced Stockings, he enjoying a good health ſome years afterwards.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the laſt great Plague, while I was in the Country,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a ſwelled Thigh.</note> I was fetched to a Perſon of worth, of about ſeventy years of age, lying in bed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed with a cold phlegmatick Tumour in his right Thigh, ſoft and yielding to the impreſſion of my fingers. Doctour <hi>Bowles</hi> had been with him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a Fomentation with Embrocations to be daily applied. I approved of what had been done: but the weather being then extream cold, the ground covered with Froſt and Snow, I thought he might get cold in the time of Dreſſing; and beſides, without a ſtrict Bandage it was not likely to remove that Tumour. Therefore I offered to their conſideration, whether a Flannell Trowze might not be made to lace ſtreight upon that Thigh, to cheriſh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat of the Part, and defer the Cure of the Tumour till the Spring. The Patient approved of it, and declared that he would return to <hi>London</hi> about that time, and conſult us there in order to his Cure. This being his reſolution, I directed his Servants to make a Trowze of a fine Dimity, lined with a ſoft Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, with Eylet-holes, to lace on the outſide, with a Waſt-band fitted to the upper part of it. The Trowze being made, I ſaw it laced on, a piece of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Leather being placed under the Lacing, to defend his Thigh from being hurt by it. The lower part of the Trowze was tacked to a Cotton Stocking he put on that Leg. I deſired (in caſe that Leg ſhould ſwell) they would put on a laced Stocking with a Knee-piece. After I was gone, there were ſome Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made againſt this Bandage: but the Patient, finding eaſe by it, continued the uſe of it, and came to <hi>London</hi> in the Spring of the year, and ſent for Sir <hi>Fr. Prujean,</hi> Doctour <hi>Bowles,</hi> and my ſelf, to meet Sir <hi>Ed. Alſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>L.</hi> a Chirurgeon at his houſe, to conſult his health. We met, and found the Patient walking in a large Dining-room. He gave us an account of the Swelling in his Thigh, and how it was cured by the Bandage I had directed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He alſo related to us how he had been over-perſwaded to have the Calf of that Leg bliſtered, and of the pain it gave him, and that a Fontanel had been made in the ſame Leg; which he was alſo forced to heal up by reaſon of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95669:52"/>pain. (Theſe were made after I had been with him.) He farther declared the Objections had been made againſt the Bandage, and ſaid, he had therefore ſent for us together, to have our Opinions how to regulate himſelf for the future. The Phyſicians did all approve of the Bandage, and allowed his wearing laced Stockings on his Legs in caſe they ſhould ſwell, and preſcribed him a ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Pill and ſome pectoral Syrups to take for a Cough he was ſubject to. Some while after the Patient's Legs ſwelling again, I put him on laced Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, which he did wear till they recovered their tone. Afterwards, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offered, he wore them, or left them off. During the time he wore them, he commonly bathed his Legs with warm water at night (by my direction) once a week to refreſh them, and put freſh Stockings on the next morning. Thus he lived happily ſome years, and died of Old age.</p>
                     <p>A Youth aged about 15 years was diſeaſed with the Small-pox,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of an oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dematous Swelling with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> and ſoon afterwards with a <hi>Rheumatiſmus,</hi> which eſpecially afflicted the <hi>Scapulae</hi> and right <hi>Iſchion.</hi> During theſe Diſtempers the Phyſicians endeavoured by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Bleeding, Sudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to take off the Ferment in the bloud: but the pain increaſed, and that Leg ſwelled from the Hip to the very Toes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and ſeemed oedematous. On each of the <hi>Scapulae</hi> there alſo appeared a large Tumour without Inflammation. Theſe latter we judged to be full of Matter, and accordingly I opened them by Inciſion, and diſcharged a great quantity of purulent Matter. We dreſſed them with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> upon Pledgits. The Swelling in the Leg we ſtuped with a Decoction of warm Plants in a common Lixivie, adding to it ſome Brandy-wine. After we had well fomented it, we embrocated the whole Member with <hi>ol. olivae</hi> and a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of common Salt; then rowled it from the Toes up to the Hip, and placed the Foot and lower part of the Leg ſo high upon Pillows as might hinder the deſcent of the Humours. We alſo laid him upon his left Side, to give eaſe to a large Ulceration upon the <hi>Os coxendicis,</hi> which was occaſioned by his long lying upon that Part. After we had thus dreſſed him, my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſeman</hi> took the care of him, and in four or five days removed the Swelling out of the Foot, Leg, Knee, and lower part of the Thigh, to the great eaſe of the Patient: but the while the upper part of the Thigh and Hip ſwelled the more; alſo an Anaſarcous Tumour ſtretched the <hi>Scrotum</hi> to ſuch a bulk as hindred his lying longer upon his Side. At the fight of which I ſcarified it with a Lancet, gave vent to that ſerous Humour, applied a warm Stupe on it wrung out of the forementioned Decoction, and thereby freed the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> ſo perfectly well as it became no more difeaſed. The Abſceſs <hi>in Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> continued to matter much, and the Bones were felt bare in both of them: but upon making new Apertions in the Parts more declining, the Matter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged eaſily, and they cured within three weeks after. But in the mean time the Tumour in the upper part of the Thigh became painfull daily more and more. Feeling Matter fluctuate in it, we opened it by Inciſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a large quantity of Matter indifferently concocted: yet we could not by ſearch of Probe diſcover any <hi>Sinus</hi> conſiderable; but, by preſſure with our hands upon the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and back-ſide of the <hi>Ilion,</hi> we ſaw the Matter flow freſh out of the Abſceſs: upon which account care was taken to make Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſure by Bandage upon that Part. Whilſt this Abſceſs became the care of the Chirurgeons, there was conſideration had of Internals, to diſpoſe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to a healing condition. But, alas! he was ſo emaciated, weak and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by reaſon of new Ulcerations which were riſen upon the <hi>Os coccygis</hi> and both Hips, that we onely preſcribed him good Broths and ſuch Meat as might nouriſh him; and at laſt, for his more eaſe, we placed him directly upon his Belly; and thereby the Ulcers which had been made by lying on the places
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95669:52"/>aforeſaid were diſpoſed to cure, and the Matter which lodged deep in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Thigh and <hi>Iſchion,</hi> &amp;c. by this pofition made its way down by the <hi>Os ilion,</hi> and flowed more plentifully. Upon fight whereof that Opening was inlarged about two or three inches, for the more free diſcharge. From that time the Matter daily leſſened, and accordingly the Tumour diminiſhed, the Abſceſs and external Ulcerations healed, and the Patient viſibly recovered his ſtrength, inſomuch that we hoped our work had been well-nigh at an end. But he not being able to lie ſo long upon his Belly, the Ulcerations on his Back and Hips increaſed, and proved exceedingly vexatious, alſo the Swelling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Iſchion</hi> grew big, and ſo painfull, that it contracted that Leg. Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Cataplaſms powerfully diſcutient and reſolvent were for ſome time applied: they proving ineffectual, we applied a ſtrong Cauſtick on the middle of that Tumour, and cut into it: but it appearing dry and callous, we filled up the Apertion with Praecipitate. While we were digeſting out that <hi>Callus,</hi> Embrocations were uſed to the contracted Tendons, and the Ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were daily dreſſed, whereby in the ſpace of ſix weeks they were all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Patient reſtored to the uſe of that Leg, but as yet he makes uſe of Crutches to ſupport his weak body.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to an Infant of about a year old,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of an <hi>Oedema</hi> in the Thigh.</note> diſeaſed with a ſoft white Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the midſt of her right Thigh yielding to the impreſſion of my fingers: it was of a very large ſize, without much complaint of pain. I embrocated the Swelling with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and Bay-ſalt, and applied an Emplaſter of <hi>diachyl. ireat. cum aceto,</hi> with Bandage over it. After a few days continuance of theſe Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, finding the Tumour not to leſſen, I fomented it with the milder Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſet down in the method of Cure, and applied <hi>Emplaſt. diaſulph.</hi> by the uſe of which it ſeemed to diſſolve; but afterwards it increaſed again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hard, of a dusky colour, and as it were fixed to the Bone. Then I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex mucilag. rad. althaeae, lilior. ſem lini &amp; foenugraeci,</hi> &amp;c. endeavouring Reſolution: but it inflamed, and ſuppurated deep amongſt the Muſcles. I continued Suppuratives, and after a few days, the Matter being more concocted, opened it, and gave vent to a foetid Matter; then dreſſing up the Abſceſs with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> upon a Tent, I embrocated it with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> applied the ſame Cataplaſm, and afterwards deterged it with <hi>mundif.

It was not the <hi>Evil,</hi> but, the Child ſeeming an object of Charity, I offered her the Cure of it; and at the ſame time, while the Child lay upon the Table, I made Inciſion into it without asking leave, and diſcharged, I believe, near a Chamber-pot full of a crude Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then dreſſed it up with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Emplaſtr. diachal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage. The ſecond day ſhe brought him again to me, and then the Skin ſeemed much contracted; yet it bagg'd, and had near a Porrenger-full of Matter in it. I laid it open that way with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and dreſſed it afterwards once more. My Servants from that time continued to doe it, till ſhe thought ſhe could cure it her ſelf.</p>

Dr. <hi>Denton</hi> was his Phyſician, who, having recovered the Child to a tolerable meaſure of health, took me along with him to conſider thoſe Swellings. There was one round
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95669:53"/>Tumour near the Hip, the other was on the fore-part of the Thigh, very large: they had all the ſigns of flatulent Tumours (except the Sound.) We applied <hi>Emplaſtr. diaſulph.</hi> and put on a laced Trowze with a Compreſs upon the Tumours, and deferred the farther proſecution of the Cure till the weather grew warmer; and then, finding the Tumours unreſolved, we fomented them with Diſcutients boiled in a common <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and repeated the uſe of the former Emplaſter, by which the Tumour on the outſide diſcuſſed, (if it did not paſs its Matter into the other:) which ſoon after I opened in the moſt decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part four fingers breadth above the Knee, and, inſtead of Wind, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a large Porrenger-full of a clay-coloured foetid Matter. The Opening was made by Cauſtick: it ſerved for the eaſie diſcharge of the Matter, which after a few days leſſened, and by Compreſſion the Part agglutinated above, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without farther inlarging or putting in a Tent.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about thirty years of age having from his youth been vexed with a fiſtulous Ulcer in his right Teſticle,<note place="margin">9.

He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Mr. <hi>Jenman</hi> and my ſelf. The Swelling was hard and painfull, but without Inflammation. We ſuppoſed it to ariſe from an effuſion of <hi>Serum</hi> through all the hypogaſtrick Arteries. That of the Teſticle we believed to come from Juices caſt in by the ſpermatick Veſſels, which, meeting with a check in their progreſs, made the whole Teſticle ſcirrhous, and the Ulcer, as I ſaid, fiſtulous. We begun our Applications to the Tumour with a diſcutient Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. fabar. hordei, ſem. lini, foenugraeci, flor. ſambuci, cham. pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. in oxymel.</hi> hoping to ſcatter the Humour: we alſo endeavoured Revulſion by Venaeſection, Clyſters, and lenient Purgatives. Doctour <hi>Short</hi> was conſulted, and aſſiſted all along in the Cure. While we were endeavouring to diſcuſs the Tumour, it began to inflame and tend to Suppuration. Upon ſight whereof we ſuppurated it, and opened it by Cauſtick about two inches long near the <hi>Os ilion,</hi> and diſcharged a large quantity of Matter. As the Eſcar ſeparated, we endeavoured Digeſtion, and cheriſhed the Parts by good Fomentations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Compreſs and Bandage to preſs out the Matter; the Phyſician having the while preſcribed <hi>a decoct. ſarſae, chinae,</hi> &amp;c. with proper vulnerary Plants and Balſamicks, purging by intervals. Yet notwithſtanding theſe endeavours, the Abſceſs became more ſinuous, and put us upon a neceſſity of laying it open the whole length as it lay tranſverſe the Belly. The Matter was thereby more eaſily diſcharged; but, by reaſon of its virulencie, it corroded under the Lips of the Ulcer, rendring them ſinuous and jagged, and the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> bare in ſome places. The leaſt application of a Cathaeretick exaſperated it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The rubbing of a callous Lip with the Cauſtick-ſtone gave him a fit of the Colick. Upon which conſiderations we exhibited a few grains of Turbith mineral, which gave him three or four Vomits. By the repeating of that ſome times he ſalivated, and the Ulcer afterwards became well diſpoſed and cured. The Teſticle was grown to the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and paſſed its Matter through it in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places: there was alſo another <hi>Sinus</hi> which paſſed through the body of the Teſticle downwards. We had been ſome while endeavouring to conſume the Calloſities of theſe by Emollients outwardly applied, as alſo by Cathae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks inwardly upon Tents into the Ulcer: but failing in the latter, we laid open the <hi>Sinus</hi> on the ſide of the Teſticle from one Orifice to the other, and digeſted and healed it; then paſs'd a Seton-needle through the other <hi>Sinus,</hi> and made way beneath for diſcharge of the Matter. When that lower Orifice was digeſted,<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Belly.</note> we pulled out the Ligature, and kept it open with a Tent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by drained the Matter from the uppermoſt parts, and cured the Teſticle.</p>
                     <p>A Man came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> diſeaſed with a large Tumour in the lower Belly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95669:53"/>deep under the Muſcles, without Inflammation, hardneſs or Pulſation: it was moſt prominent towards the left <hi>Inguen,</hi> and ſomewhat heated. The Tumour had been long growing, and of late very painfull. I applied an <hi>Empl. Caeſaris</hi> over the whole Tumour, and fitted him with a Bracer to bear part of the weight of it, deſigning that way to palliate it. By theſe he was ſomewhat relieved, and made a Journey with ſome of his Friends into the North, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to drink the Waters at <hi>Knaresbrook:</hi> but by reaſon of his pain he ſtopped at <hi>York;</hi> and, meeting wlth no hopes of Cure there, he returned hither, and ſent for me. I went, and found him in his bed full of pain, and that part of the Tumour in the Groin ſwelled and inflamed, and full of Matter, as I thought: but, doubting the ſucceſs, I deſired he would conſult ſome eminent men of my Profeſſion. He made choice of Mr. <hi>Tho. Hollier.</hi> We conſidered the ſituation of the Tumour, the time and manner of its growth, with the Symptoms all along attending it, and concluded it originally a Tumour by Congeſtion; ſuppoſing the pain to proceed from ſome acrimony in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> which falling into this declining Part putrefied. Upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we complied with the Patient and his Friends deſires, opened the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in that Groin by Inciſion, and diſcharged about half a large Porrenger of a bloudy <hi>Serum.</hi> We then laid it more open, and, obſerving nothing more to come forth, made a ſearch with our fingers, and, feeling nothing but Fat, dreſſed it up with Digeſtives <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. with Emplaſter and Bandage. The Patient was eaſed of his pain, and reſted well that night, The third day we met again, and found him as well as might reaſonably be expected: but from the time we opened the Tumour he had not been out of his Bed. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Dreſſings, we found the Tumour ſunk, and a little Matter from the Lips of the Wound; but from the Abſceſs there was onely a Gleet diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. We fomented the whole Belly with <hi>decoct. abſinth. flor. cham. ſambuci,</hi> &amp;c. made in Wine, and dreſſed up the Abſceſs with Digeſtives as before. We were not ſatisfied with our work, yet had no Symptoms of its penetration: he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed well, and his Urine and ſtools were good. At our next Dreſſing we ſaw the Ulcer had gleeted much, and the Opening appeared full of a greaſy Fat ſoiled, as the <hi>Omentum</hi> will be after it hath been ſome time corrupted by the air. We pulled ſome of it out, and, having made a Ligature under it, cut it off, and dreſſed up the Patient as before. We were inclinable to think that what we had cut off was part of the <hi>Omentum:</hi> but then why ſhould not the Inteſtines thruſt out? To clear this Doubt, I brought the next day an Injection made of a Decoction of ſome Vulneraries, <hi>ex rad, ireos, ariſtoloch. rot. myrrh. aloe, ſarcocoll. mell. roſ.</hi> and a little <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and caſt ſome of it up with a Syringe. It came out again. We repeated the Experiment, till we had well ſatisfied our ſelves that it came all out again: which confirmed to us that the Abſceſs was not within the cavity of the Belly amongſt the Bowells. But the caſting up of this Injection gave the Patient a Colick, upon which we uſed it no more. The Lips of the Abſceſs digeſted well, but from within it onely gleeted, and thruſt out Fat, which we daily cut off without the loſs of a drop of bloud, and dreſſed up the Abſceſs with <hi>mundif. ex apio,</hi> continuing the uſe of diſcutient Fomentations and Cataplaſms. We very much deſired to ſee our Patient up out of his Bed: but he apprehended that his Guts would tumble out; and the more Fat we pulled away, the more he deſponded, and in the ſpace of two months languiſhed and died. I reſolved to open his Body, and to that purpoſe made my Inciſion down from the <hi>Cartilag. enſiformis</hi> to the <hi>Pubes,</hi> and from the Navel croſs over. Then it appeared plainly that the Tumour was made by abundance of a ſoft white greaſie Fat lying between the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and Muſcles of the lower Belly. The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> was ſound, not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95669:54"/>the leaſt tainted, yet lay ſo bare, that the moſt curious Anatomiſt could not by Diſſection more expoſe it.</p>
                     <p>If this perſon had but roſe out of his Bed to the Cloſe-ſtool, nay, if he had but roſe upon his Knees to urine, the Fat had ſlipt out at the ſame time; for it lay looſe floating upon the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> After I had removed the Fat, I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and there I ſaw all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſound and ſweet as ever I beheld in any dead body in my life.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Of a</hi> Scirrhus.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SCirrhus</hi> hath hitherto amongſt Authours been reputed to have its Original from Melancholy and tough Phlegm:<note place="margin">What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients.</note> the truth of which I dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before I know what is meant by thoſe words. For in progreſs of diſcourſe the Writers upon this Subject do divide Melancholy into <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:</hi> a Diſtinction by whom begun I do not at preſent remember, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and uſed by all Writers of the latter Ages. Men that make this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction do ſuppoſe the <hi>natural</hi> Melancholy to be the terreſtrious part of the Bloud, but not yet to have exceeded the bounds of a ſanguineous element: <hi>preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to be ſuch as hath contracted a more then ordinarily fixed or terreſtrious quality by a fault in Concoction, which if it be onely a Humour ſo fixed, may be called preternatural Melancholy. If the Bloud was very hot and acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it hath been preſumed to be burnt, and hath gone by the name of Choler aduſt: but then it is not of the ſame kind or family. Of theſe more in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Cancers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deſire not to wade into Controverſies of this nature, fitter for the Schools then a practical Diſcourſe: it may ſuffice to give ſuch a notion of Melancholy as may be agreeable to the common conceptions of men verſed in the Facultie.</p>
                     <p>If we ſo derive our Notion, we may conſider the Bloud to be bred out of <hi>Chyle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What truly it is, with its Cauſes.</note> which in the lacteous Veſſels is white, but when it enters the Veins it by degrees groweth to be pellucid, and then is called <hi>Serum,</hi> and in ſome caſes <hi>Pituita;</hi> and at laſt, when it is red, we call it <hi>Bloud.</hi> Which Bloud conſiſts of much Salt and Sulphur, without which neither the animal Spirits nor the ſolid Parts themſelves could be made. According to the degrees of fixedneſs and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility that theſe Salts and Sulphurs do acquire, the Bloud is more or leſs flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and the whole Habit of body of a better or worſe Conſtitution. If theſe Parts arrive to their due volatility, the whole Habit is Sanguine: if they be too fixed, it is Melancholick, according to the old phraſe; which is indeed ſo far from being Aduſtion, that it is rather a Crudity, and the body in this caſe differs from a Sanguine condition as a green Apple doth from a ripe one. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault of the Bloud that the <hi>Chyle,</hi> having met with too great acidity in the firſt Concoction, doth not ever acquire a genuine ripeneſs, but is apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion to concrete it ſelf upon the Fibres of the Tendons or Muſcles out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and upon the <hi>Viſcera</hi> inwardly: which Concretion, where it happens, is that Tumour which we call <hi>Scirrhus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Scirrhus</hi> muſt be taken from the various mixture that happens in the Juices of the Bloud.<note place="margin">Differences.</note> For Bloud, being made at ſeveral times, may partake of many ſeveral qualities; ſome of which may be produced in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95669:54"/>Maſs of Bloud, and ſome in the Part it ſelf, either by the peculiar Ferment thereof, or elſe by the alteration it may receive from applications of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If a falſe Ferment in the Ventricle vitiate the Digeſtion, inſtead of good and laudable <hi>Chyle,</hi> we often find the product to be peccant, either in acidity, or acrimony, or ſome other quality. If it be Acrimony, when it comes into the Bloud it produceth many hot Diſeaſes, and often Cancers: of which more hereafter. If a meer crude Acidity, then the body is liable to a <hi>Scirrhus:</hi> but that <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> according to the various mixtures it may meet with of Bloud that went before, may be ſo compounded as to make thoſe ſeveral Species which we call <hi>Scirrhus phlegmonoïdes, eryſipelatodes, aedematodes,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, though the whole Bloud may be troubled with one uniform Diſtemper, which may diſpoſe it to the raiſing of a <hi>Phlegmon, Eryſipelas, Oedema,</hi> &amp;c. yet the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Medicines to a Part ſo affected may be ſuch as, exhaling too ſuddenly the thinner Juices, may make the cruder portion that remains, inſtead of ripening into a due Digeſtion, harden into a <hi>Scirrhus:</hi> or elſe by Medicines that cool too much the whole Maſs may be kept in its crudity, and ſo fixed in the Part as to become hard.</p>
                     <p>The exquiſite or true <hi>Scirrhus</hi> hath no ſenſe;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> the imperfect <hi>Scirrhus</hi> hath ſome ſenſe, if it be preſſed upon. The Tumour is hard, immovable, and of a dark red colour; if <hi>Pituita</hi> be mixed with it, then it is of a livid colour. If a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be the original Diſeaſe of the Part, and not the effect of ſome other that hath been ill handled, it begins uſually ſmall like a Vetch or Pea, and by degrees increaſeth, without ſhifting or changing of place. If it be the effect of ſome other Tumour that terminated in it, as a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> &amp;c. then the Accidents proper to that Tumour did ſuddenly change into thoſe of a <hi>Scirrhus:</hi> of which you may ſee more in their proper place.</p>
                     <p>The true or exquiſite <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> being altogether without ſenſe,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> admits of no Cure. The reaſon is, becauſe the induration of the Part is ſo great, that it will not open to receive the free afflux of Bloud into it, but keeps its own hardneſs in deſpite of all Applications, and thereby the uſe of Medicaments is rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>The imperfect <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> which hath ſome ſenſe, is not incurable, but yields by Reſolution; though very often it terminates in a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scirrhus</hi> which ariſeth from <hi>Pituita,</hi> without change of colour in the Skin, if it be very big and hard, and have hair grown upon it, is neither curable, nor yet doth terminate in a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> three Intentions are required.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> The firſt is, in the regulation of Diet and manner of living: the ſecond is, in the preparing and evacuating of the antecedent or peccant Humour: and the third is, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of external Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>In order to the firſt, the Air ought to be clear, and temperately hot and moiſt. Their Aliment ſuch as may breed good Bloud; as new-laid Eggs, Chickens, Pullets, Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Kid: and theſe boiled with Spinage, Borrage, Endive, Succory, Lettice, Sorrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are better then roaſted. Their Bread ought to be of good Wheat and well baked; their Drink a well-boiled ſmall Ale, or ſmall White-wine, <hi>Rheniſh,</hi> &amp;c. Their Exerciſe moderate, and alſo their Sleep: their Mind chearfull, free from care: and the Body ſoluble, by Clyſters or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention is, the evacuation of the Humour which aboundeth in the Body: whether, to uſe the vulgar phraſe, it be <hi>Pituita</hi> or Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that cauſed the <hi>Scirrhus;</hi> or that it proceeded from Obſtructions of the <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> or Suppreſſion of the Haemorrhoids. If from any of theſe Cauſes Bloud abounds and be feculent, Phlebotomy is allowed, a Clyſter preceding:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95669:55"/>but if Bloud do not abound, forbear Bleeding, and proceed in preparing and evacuating the Humours.</p>
                     <p>The Preparatives thereto, according to the Ancients, were with <hi>ſyr. de ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co borrag. bugloſſ. fumariae, lupul. de duabus radicibus, de pomis, Byzantinus,</hi> &amp;c. in the diſtilled water of the ſame Plants, or in Whey. But our Patients would think that time loſt: therefore, inſtead of thoſe Digeſtives, we purge with Minoratives; viz. <hi>decoct. ſenae Gereonis, decoct. epithymi,</hi> alſo Decoctions of <hi>caſſia, tamarind.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum ſyrupis de pomis purg.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>elect. diacathol. diaprun. ſolut. diacaſſiae;</hi> and alſo <hi>pil. de lapide lazuli, de agarico, aggregativ.</hi> &amp;c. Theſe tough Humours require frequent Purging, but not by ſtrong Catharticks: <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. hamech</hi> and <hi>elect. diaphoenic.</hi> are of the ſtrongeſt ſort. If Phlegm abound, proceed as hath been propoſed in <hi>Oedema,</hi> and forbear Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Plethora</hi> evacuated, you may endeavour Revulſion to the contrary Parts by Friction, Cupping, Fontanels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Obſtructions of the Haemorrhoids Leeches may be applied; and in Suppreſſion of the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> a Vein may be opened in the Arm or Leg.</p>
                     <p>The third Intenſion is performed in treating the Tumour it ſelf: in which theſe Directions are to be followed. Firſt, that you do not uſe Repellents; for cold and tough Humours, of which theſe Swellings are created, are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of returning back as hot Humours, but do increaſe the more thereby. In the next place, you ought to be cautious in the uſe of Emollients alone; for thereby they are frequently exaſperated, and terminate in Cancers. You ought alſo to avoid the uſe of the ſtronger Diſcutients, leſt thereby you reſolve the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thin Humours, and convert the groſſer part into a more ſolid ſubſtance. Therefore you are to conſider well the Habit of the Body, and whether the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> be recent or old, and what the Parts are that be affected, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Medicaments accordingly.</p>
                     <p>As to the Habit of the Body: young people, and ſuch as live effeminately, require to be treated with milder Reſolvents then thoſe who live a labouring life. So alſo a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> in its recency, whilſt it is in its augment, requireth milder Applications then the confirmed or inveterate one. And thoſe <hi>Scirrhi</hi> ariſing in the Fleſhy parts will more eaſily reſolve then thoſe on the Ligaments and Tendons.</p>
                     <p>The milder Reſolvents are <hi>butyrum rec. adeps gallinac. ol. amygdal. dulc. lilior. adeps anſer. anatis, ſevum vitulin. hircinum, vaccinum, axung. porcin. vet. rad. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeae, lilior.</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Some Writers do not approve of Fomentations: but I have alwaies found them neceſſary to diſpoſe the Tumour to Reſolution, and have ever begun my Applications with them, and do propoſe them to you. ℞ <hi>rad. althaeae, lilior. an.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>rad. cucumeris agreſt.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſummitat. cicutae,</hi> M. ij. <hi>ſummitat. majoran.</hi> M. j. <hi>flor. meliloti, ſambuci, an.</hi> P.j. <hi>ſem. lini, foenugraeci, althaeae, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>coquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in ſ. q. aq. font. colaturae adde aceti modicum.</hi>

                     <p>A Perſon of Honour near 40 years of age, of a full Body,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> had been long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to oedematous Swellings in both her Legs from the Knees down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for the remedying of which many Applications had been made abroad during the time ſhe was in <hi>France;</hi> but, by reaſon of her conſtant attendance there, they continued ſwelling, and in progreſs of time the Matter indurated and became Scirrhous, not onely along her Shins, but the muſculous Fleſh on the Calves of her Legs and Ancles. The Cure was difficult; but ſhe promiſing to keep her Chamber, I undertook it. She conſulted Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her body by Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after which I began my work with the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation ſet down in the method of Cure, her Servants bathing her Legs with a Sponge morning and evening; after which they were embrocated <hi>cum oleo ex ped. bovinis &amp; ol. lumbric.</hi> Then I applied a Cerote on them of <hi>unguent. dialthaeae</hi> and Wax, and rowled them moderately on to retain the Dreſſings: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſhe reſted her ſelf upon a Bed or Pallet daily. Whilſt this Perſon was under Cure, there happened a private Diſſection of a ſound Body at our Hall, whence I collected a good quantity of Fat, which I clarified, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fomenting of her Legs, I embrocated them with it twice aday; to which I imputed very much the Recovery; for from that time the hardneſs viſibly reſolved, and in a month's ſpace they were reſtored. During this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Dreſſing ſhe was frequently purged, and a Fontanel made in each Leg. Suſpecting her Legs might ſwell upon her firſt going abroad, I cauſed a pair of laced Stockings to be put on, which ſhe did wear ſome few days: but obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they did not ſwell, ſhe not onely left them off, but healed up the Fontanels.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about fifty years of age by a Fall brake his lower Jaw,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> the Cure whereof you may ſee in the Treatiſe of <hi>Fractures.</hi> About half a year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame Patient complained of a hard Tumour fixed under that Ear and <hi>Maxilla,</hi> of a dark red colour, not ſo much painfull, as uneaſie from the hard binding of the Parts together. It was an imperfect <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> and not unlike to end in a Cancer. Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh,</hi> Phyſician to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and one of His Majeſtie's Phyſicians, was conſulted, and by his preſcription the Patient was let bloud, and ſeveral times purged. I fomented the Tumour with the <hi>Fotus</hi> above mentioned, and embrocated it with <hi>ol. lilior. ſambuci,</hi> and <hi>unguent. dialthaeae,</hi> applying <hi>Empl. diachyl. cum gummi,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Cataplaſm <hi>ex fol. cicutae, rad. lilior. ſem. lini, foenugraeci,</hi> &amp;c. During theſe Applications little hard Tubercles roſe in the body of the Tumour, (as I have ſometime ſeen riſe about the Lips of inveterate cancerated Ulcers,) and after ſome days brake and gleeted, but would not digeſt. In the preſence of the Phyſician I cut into them, filled them with Praecipitate, applied <hi>unguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum baſilicon</hi> on them, and continued the uſe of Fomentations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Praecipitate not digeſting them, I rubbed into them with a Cauſtick-ſtone, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Eſcars, and filled them with Praecipitate, from that time haſtning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Sloughs. Then by the Vitriol-ſtone and Praecipitate I deterged them. As theſe digeſted, the hardneſs reſolved, and I cured them with <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi> The Patient being cured, we ſent for Mr. <hi>Goſling,</hi> to inform himſelf whether any carious Tooth or Stump affected that Jaw. He pulled out one; but whether that was the cauſe I much doubt.</p>

It was occaſioned by a Fall upon a Threſhold of a door, which bruiſed the Part, and I ſuppoſe made a large extravaſation, which, for want of timely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing, dried and hardened. The Tumour was ſenſible, but not otherwiſe painfull then as it numm'd that ſide of the Leg, and ſo cauſed a Lameneſs. I began with Venaeſection, and purged him frequently with <hi>decoct. epithymi,</hi> &amp;c. during which I fomented the Tumour with the <hi>Fotus</hi> propoſed in the method of Cure, and beat and pulped the <hi>faeces</hi> of it, and with <hi>farin. lentium &amp; hordei cum axung anſeris &amp; ol. lilior.</hi> made up a Cataplaſm and applied it. I embroca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the benumm'd Parts with <hi>ol. lumbricor.</hi> and made him a Fontanel on that ſide of the Leg. After I had continued theſe Applications ſome days, I added more <hi>Cicuta</hi> to the Cataplaſm, and boiled it in Wine and Water. By the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent application of the <hi>Cicuta</hi> the Skin was fretted; in which caſe I omitted the uſe of it, and applied the milder reſolvent Emplaſter ſet down in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure, and embrocated the Tumour with <hi>axung. humana.</hi> By this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I reſolved the Tumour, and diſmiſſed him cured.</p>
                     <p>I could give you ſome other Inſtances of theſe imperfect <hi>Scirrhi;</hi> but they not differing in their Cure, I ſhall forbear, and conclude this Chapter with one Inſtance of a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> which may ſerve to ſhew what the Diſeaſe is when heightned by acrimony or evil quality.</p>
                     <p>A Gentle woman aged fourty eight years,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> of a full Body, having been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed by immoderate fluxes of the <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> and ſubject to Cough with Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at length recovered her health by the preſcriptions of Doctour <hi>Denton,</hi> and enjoyed it the ſpace of a year; but was then ſeized with a ſtreightneſs and pain in her right Breaſt, which increaſing much with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſhe came again to her Phyſician, who ſent for me. At the firſt ſight it ſeemed to me a confirmed Cancer fixed to the Ribs: but upon more mature deliberation and handling of it, I found the Diſeaſe was in the Skin, and that the Glands and muſculous fleſh underneath it were not hard, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe affected then as they were bound in by the intenſe hardneſs of the Skin, which kept them immovable. From that uneaſineſs an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> was raiſed, which overſpred the Skin of the Breaſt and Parts about with great heat. We ſuppoſed the hardneſs proceeded from a concretion of the nutritious Juices: but how to relieve her was the difficultie. We applied over the Parts affected <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> to repreſs the heat, and ſupplied her with Medicaments to dreſs her ſelf, that ſhe might, according to her deſire, retire to her houſe in the Country, where ſhe was let bloud, and purged with <hi>manna</hi> and <hi>cremor tartar.</hi> diſſolved in Whey; and her houſe being near <hi>Epſom,</hi> ſhe was afterwards pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with thoſe Waters. But, after all, growing more indiſpoſed, ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>London:</hi> at which time I ſaw her Breaſt inflamed and excoriated, alſo ſeveral hard Tubercles riſen in the Skin which gleeted much. The <hi>Scirrhus</hi> was alſo ſpred up that ſide of the Neck by the <hi>Muſcul. maſtoïdes</hi> to the <hi>Os bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri</hi> and <hi>Scapula,</hi> and ſo under that <hi>Axilla,</hi> and down that ſide. We dreſſed ſome of the Excoriations with <hi>unguent. tutiae Vigonis,</hi> and others with Pledgits dipt in this following Lotion; ℞ <hi>aq. ſpermat. ranar.</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr>j. <hi>ſem. cydon.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij. <hi>ſem. plantag.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>infund. calide per quatuor horas: colaturae adde troch. alb. Rhaſ. pulv.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>ſacchar. Saturni</hi> ℈ ſs. And over all we applied ſome of this following Cerote: ℞ <hi>mucilag. ſem. cydon. pſyllii extract. cum aqua ſolani, an.</hi> ℥iv. <hi>unguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti nutriti</hi> ℥iij. <hi>unguent. popul.</hi> ℥vj. <hi>cerae albae q. ſ. ſiat Ceratum.</hi> Thus the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation was remitted, and the Excoriations healed in ſome places, and checked in others. Many internal Remedies were alſo preſcribed, Emulſions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95669:56"/>Cordials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Accidents which happened. During the while I was in the Country other Chirurgeons were conſulted, but without ſucceſs; the <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> ſtill ſpreading, over-ran the other Breaſt and ſide of the Neck, and in few weeks rendered her Neck ſtiff and immovable: and, by reaſon of the Compreſſion which was made in the <hi>Axilla</hi> and about the Shoulder, there was a reſtagnation of the Humours, and the Arm ſwelled to the Fingers ends. We fomented the Arm with a <hi>decoct. fol. &amp; rad. althaeae, fol. violar. plantag. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lani, ſalicis, lenticulae paluſtris, flor. cham. meliloti, ſem. lini, foenug.</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Embrocations and Cerots, Emollients and Reſolvents, to ſuccour theſe Parts: but all this while ſhe was either afflicted with Colicks, or <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> or Vomiting. We endeavoured to carry off the Matter by <hi>Calomel,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and by Mercurial Unguents outwardly, and would have ſalivated her, if ſhe would have permitted. The weather growing hot, and her Lodgings being too ſtreight, ſhe removed again to her houſe in the Country, where ſhe was viſited by us. I ſaw the <hi>Scirrhus</hi> affecting both ſides of her Neck, her Shoulders, Arms, Breaſts and Sides, and beginning to invade the Skin of her Loins and Hips; yet ſhe was not at that time ſick or pained, but eat her Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner well. She at length grew weary of Medicine, and with patience endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the remaining Accidents of her Diſeaſe till it killed her. She was ſeized with this <hi>Scirrhus</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> and died in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Warts and Corns.</head>
                     <p>HAving run through the Diſcourſe of <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> I ſhall make bold to adde to it ſomething concerning <hi>Warts</hi> and <hi>Corns,</hi> as being more reducible to that Head then to any other that I know: they being for the moſt part indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tumours; and though ſometimes we find them ſoft, yet that is upon ſome admixture of an extraneous Humour that makes the Tumour compound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warts</hi> and <hi>Corns</hi> are both of them cutaneous Tumours, but do differ from each other by this moſt eſſential Difference: A <hi>Wart</hi> beginneth in the <hi>Cutis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſe of Warts.</note> and ſeemeth to be either an effloreſcence of the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud, which, hardning in the ſurface of the Skin, maketh a dry Tumour; or elſe ſome ſmall luxuriancy of the little Arteries of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> which do thruſt out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, making a petty <hi>Sarcoma</hi> which we call a <hi>ſoft Wart.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differences.</note> According to the variety of the Tumour, it is ſometimes whole with a ſmooth ſurface, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chapp'd and uneven. According to the manner of their production, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ariſe by a general exſudation out of the <hi>Cutis,</hi> with a broad <hi>baſis,</hi> and are called <hi>Verrucae ſeſſiles;</hi> ſometimes a few Capillaries putting out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, after they have grown to a ſmall length, inlarge themſelves into a greater compaſs, and make the penſile Tumour we call <hi>Acrochordon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Corn,</hi> on the other ſide, beginneth in the <hi>Cuticula</hi> with its <hi>baſis</hi> outward,<note place="margin">Cauſe of Corns.</note> owing its origin to an outward Compreſſion, and thence derives it ſelf inward into the Skin, nay, often through it to the Membranes, Tendons, and Cartilages, to which it frequently unites it ſelf, to the no ſmall diſturbance of the Patient. It groweth in any part that is liable to great Preſſure; the Toes and Feet, the Lips of Trumpetters, the Ears of Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The hardeſt part of the Corn is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95669:57"/>uſually in the middle, thruſting it ſelf in like a Nail; whence it hath its <hi>Latine</hi> appellation of <hi>Clavus.</hi> That hard part doth often turn black, making a ſpeck in the middle, which in ſome Countries gives it the name of a <hi>Bird's eye.</hi> The outſides are ſofter, not ſo horny as the former, but ſtill ſcirrhous, and do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prohibit acceſs into the hole whence the Corn grew, if it have been cut out; or elſe ſuffer themſelves to be crowded into the place that was voided by exciſion, there hardning into a new Corn of the like ſolidity with the former.</p>
                     <p>But it is not alwaies that Corns are hard,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> they often are ſoft between the Toes, where the Compreſſion is not great, and ſometimes have Inflammation joined with them: which variety is ordinarily obſerved, and eaſily reduced to the common heads.</p>
                     <p>There need no <hi>Signs</hi> be given of <hi>Warts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs of both.</note> they being ſo apparent. And for <hi>Corns,</hi> whether they be hard or ſoft, the pain will diſcover them: yet in the ſoft Corns the Skin is for the moſt part whiter then the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warts</hi> do often fall away of themſelves;<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> whereas <hi>Corns</hi> are ſcarce ever ſo cured that they return not again.</p>
                     <p>The Medicaments commended in the Cure of <hi>Warts</hi> are many.<note place="margin">Cure of Warts.</note> Thoſe which are moſt eaſie to be had in the Country are, the green Rinds of Willows beaten, the juice of Marigolds, Celandine, all the Spurges, a Garden-ſnail ſprinkled with Salt. If you rub them with any of theſe, they will fall off. <hi>Ol. vitrioli</hi> or <hi>ol. ſulphuris</hi> will certainly deſtroy them. I have ſeen ſome burn them out by running a hot Needle into the roots of them. There are other waies, as by rubbing them with raw Beef, and burying it. But when any great one falls into my hands, I make a ſpeedier riddance of it by Ligature or Cauſtick. Where it is capable of being tied, I make a Ligature: in others, where it is not, the Cauſtick-ſtone alone will doe it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Corns</hi> is in paring them off,<note place="margin">Cure of Corns.</note> and applying red ſoft Wax: or, ℞ <hi>picis navalis</hi> ℥j. <hi>Empl. diachyl. magn.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>gum. galban, diſſolut, in aceto</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ſalis ammoniaci</hi> ℈ j. <hi>Miſce;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>aluminis, vitrioli <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngarici, auripigment. ana part. aequal. pulveriz. &amp; miſceantur cum aceto.</hi> All which are proper as well in the ſoft as in the hard Corns.</p>
                     <p>A Young Lady,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Warts.</note> having been long vexed with an unſeemly over-grown Wart upon one of her Fore-fingers, deſired my help. I rubbed the chapp'd head of it with a Cauſtick-ſtone till it was ſoft and black, then ſcraped it off, and rubbed the remaining root with ſome of the ſame till I judged it was era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, then waſhed out the Salts, and dreſſed it <hi>cum unguent. baſilic.</hi> with a few drops of <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> which made ſeparation of the Eſcar, and cured it.</p>
                     <p>In another young perſon,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> where they were ſmall in the <hi>baſis,</hi> I tied ſome of them cloſe by the roots with a Silk, others I ſnipt off with a pair of Sciſſors, not regarding the dropping of the bloud upon the neighbouring Parts, which is thought to infect them, and beget others. Then I rubbed the roots of them all with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and digeſted the Sloughs out as above ſaid, and they cicatrized of themſelves the while.</p>
                     <p>Yet you ought to be cautious how you meddle with thoſe growing upon the Knuckles:<note place="margin">Caution.</note> for Warts there, being for the moſt part near the Tendons, cannot well be extirpated without offending them, and ſo are conſequently ſubject to Fluxion, and corrupt the Cartilages or Bone.</p>
                     <p>This was the caſe of a Perſon of quality aged about fifty years,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> of a pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Body, who had a Wart upon the firſt Joint of one of her Fore-fingers. It was imprudently undertaken by ſome pretender to Chirurgery, and treated as ill; ſo that after many months endeavours he was diſmiſſed, and a more knowing Chirurgeon entertained, who found much difficulty in the Cure, yet made a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95669:57"/>ſhift to cicatrize it: but it ſwelled again, and diſcharged part of its Matter by the ſide of that Nail. Upon ſight whereof I was conſulted, and ſaw a thin <hi>Ichor</hi> weeping through the old <hi>Cicatrix</hi> at an Opening not bigger then a ſmall Pin-hole. The Lady importuning me to undertake the Cure, I ſprinkled the Orifice with Praecipitate, whereby I cruſted in the Matter to thin the Skin, which the next day I opened, and by ſearch of a Probe felt the Cartilages rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I informed the Patient of the neceſſity of making an Inciſion proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably large in order to the Exfoliation, and withall repreſented the difficulty; and offered to her conſideration the more certain and ſpeedy way by cutting off that Joint. She with little demurre conſented to it. All things being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prepared, I chopt off that Joint, dreſſed it up with <hi>pulver. Galeni,</hi> and afterwards digeſted it, and cured it, as hath been ſhewed in ſuch like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpations.</p>
                     <p>A Citizen came to me complaining of a pain between the two little Toes of one of his Feet,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a ſoft Corn.</note> which he had of a long time ſuppoſed to ariſe from a Corn on the outſide of his little Toe, and pared that often, cauſing his Shoes to be made wider, yet without any manner of eaſe: but of late he had diſcovered the pain to be on the inſide of the little Toe. I looked on it, and, ſeeing the Skin whiter there then on the other parts, concluded it a ſoft Corn, and ſent for one to cut it out. He pared out that white Skin, and filled up the <hi>Fovea</hi> with ſoft red Wax. From that inſtant he wore the ſtreighteſt Shoes with much eaſe.</p>
                     <p>Many ſuch like Corns I have been conſulted in making the diſcovery, and by my advice they have after the aforeſaid manner relieved themſelves.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of quality complained to me of a pain in the Joint of her great Toe and Sole of the Foot:<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> underneath the Toes ſhe ſaid her pain was ſo much, that ſhe could neither goe in the day upon it, nor ſleep in the night. I looked upon them, and, ſuppoſing they might be ſoft Corns, ſent for a Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutter. He cut away the thick Skin to the quick, as we thought; but ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in much pain, and, ſending for me the next morning, told me ſhe had not been in bed that night by reaſon of her exceeding pain. I ſuſpected they had been cut too cloſe, and were feſtering; but in looking upon them I ſaw no heat or diſturbance; yet upon preſſing my fingers on them ſhe complained much. I, concluding there was ſome fault under the Skin, reſolved to find it out: to which purpoſe I rubbed one of theſe places with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and ſcraped away the Skin as it ſoftned, and, penetrating more deep, gave vent to an extravaſated Bloud. I ſerved the reſt ſo, and found the like Bloud in every one of them: the quantity did not exceed the kernel of a Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. I dreſſed them all with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and an <hi>Empl. diapalm.</hi> over them, and thereby they cicatrized in twice or thrice dreſſing; but from the firſt dreſſing her pain ceaſed, and ſhe continueth ſince without complaint.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of the hard Corns of the Feet or Toes I do not buſy my ſelf, if ſuch Emplaſters as have been propoſed fail, they may ſend for the Corn-cutter. But if through pain a Fluxion be occaſioned, and the Part apoſtemate, it may then be worth the conſulting a Chirurgeon; for generally they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the <hi>Perioſteum:</hi> and if the Apoſtemation doth not foul the Bone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, yet the Lips of the Ulcer grow callous, and do not eaſily unite.</p>
                     <p>An clderly Gentlewoman was much afflicted with Corns,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from a Corn.</note> eſpecially one on one of her little Toes, which apoſtemated, and diſcharged its Matter forth at a ſmall Pin-hole. The ſpeedy Cure was, by eating that Skin off with a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, or cutting it away, that the Matter being at once let out it might heal. But ſhe not admitting of either, I was put upon the neceſſity of paring away the Calloſity, and dreſſing it with Lenients. Thus the Skin was kept ſupple, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95669:58"/>the Matter diſcharging freely the while, it healed underneath, and the Calloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pilled off: and from that time the Toe hath continued free from Corns.</p>
                     <p>A young Lady about fifteen years of age had an Apoſtemation on the outſide of one of her Toes.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> It was occaſioned by the hard preſſure of a Corn upon the Joint of it, and had continued ſome months diſcharging its Matter through the middle of the Corn, in ſpite of the endeavours that had been tried by Corn-cutters and others. Upon ſight of it, the Skin which covered the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer appeared (to my judgment) callous within, and not capable of uniting with the parts underneath. Upon which conſideration I ſtopt the Orifice with Lint, and, rubbing the Skin with a Cauſtick-ſtone, removed that falſe cover; then dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> warm; by which it was digeſted, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cicatrized.</p>
                     <p>Another having an Apoſtemation on the outſide of her little Toe by reaſon of its hard Preſſure,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> I opened it by Inciſion, and diſcharged the Matter; and afterwards perceiving the Matter retained under the callous looſe Skin, I ſnipt it off with my Sciſſors, whereby ſhe was freed of her Corn, and the Ulcer was ſoon cured by the aboveſaid Unguent.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman came to <hi>London</hi> with an Ulcer in one of her Toes,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> that next to the little one. It was on the middle Joint, occaſioned by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a Corn. Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> commended her to my hands. We dilated the Ulcer, and diſcovered the Bone carious. We adviſed her to keep her Chamber in order to the Exfoliation of it, and withall put her in mind that it was the work of nature, and required time for the perfecting of it. Upon which ſhe demanded how long the Wound might be curing if the Toe were cut off: and being told fourteen days; ſhe replied, Cut it off. We did ſo, and cured it accordingly by the method uſual in ſuch Extirpations.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Of a Cancer.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAncer</hi> is the name of a Tumour ariſing (as it is thought) from an aduſt or atrabilious Humour.<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> It is round, unequally hard, and (if not inflamed) of a livid or brown colour, with exquiſite pricking pain: the Veins appear turgid in the Skin upon the ſurface of the Tumour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of a Cancer is uſually ſaid to be aduſtion of Humours,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an over-concoction or rather broiling grow retorrid and ſharp.</p>
                     <p>I cannot imagine what heat theſe Authours ſuppoſe to be in the Body which is capable of making ſuch an Aduſtion as is here ſpoken of. I rather impute the corroſive venome that attends this Tumour to the materials of which it is made, then to any extraordinary heat; and that becauſe we ſee the higheſt Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not attended with a Cancer, and on the contrary a Cancer not often attended with any extremity of heat: ſo that it cannot be Aduſtion that is the cauſe of the Malady. But I rather think the matter of the Humour to be in fault, which by ſome errour in Concoction became ſharp and corroſive, (it may be arſenical, as appears by the Sloughs we ſometimes finde made in a night.) This Humour, being of it ſelf ſharp and corroſive, is apt to convert whatever comes to it of Bloud into the ſame acrimony with it ſelf: which is eaſie to be done by mixing ſuch an acrimonious Ferment with a Liquour that abounds with acid Salts, as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95669:58"/>the Bloud of ſuch men uſually doth. Being ſuch, it doth increaſe apace while the Skin is yet whole; but much more when, upon breach of Skin, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of air adds to the vigour of the Ferment, upon which it grows fierce, and thruſts it ſelf out into <hi>Fungus</hi> and Tubercles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The remote Cauſe of this Tumour is, either a fault in the original Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body; or an acquired one, as by Bruiſe, Tumours, ill handling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or it may be an errour in Diet, <hi>viz.</hi> a great acrimony in the meats and drinks meeting with a fault in the firſt Concoction, which, not being afterwards cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the Guts, ſuffers this acrimonious matter to aſcend into the Bloud; where if it find vent in the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> in Women, or by the Haemorrhoids, or by <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> or Urine, or the like, the miſchief may be prevented: but if upon any defect in thoſe the Humours divert to ſome other peculiar Part, then the foundation of this Diſeaſe is laid, whether it be in the Breaſts, or other glandulous and ſpongy Parts, or indeed any other Part of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Cancers</hi> are many; ſome whereof are with Ulceration,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> others not. The Cancer not ulcerated is of two ſorts. The one is viſible and evident to the ſight in the exteriour Parts of the Body, and beareth the name of a <hi>Cancerous Tumour:</hi> the other is within the Body, and is called a <hi>Latent</hi> or <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Cancer,</hi> and poſſeſſes the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus, Anus,</hi> Palate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others call all thoſe Cancers <hi>occult</hi> which are not ulcerated, amongſt which may be reckoned thoſe which are felt in the Glands of the Breaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of theſe ſome are looſe and movable, and ſometimes ſo hard that they have knocked againſt one another like Pebbles; if it be not more fit to call them <hi>Scirrhi:</hi> others again are hard and fixed to the Bones. Some lie ſuperficially under the Skin; whereas others are deeper in the Fleſh. Other Differences may be taken from the Humour to which they owe their Original. If the Matter be not very corroſive, their growth is ſlow, and they are not very painfull. Theſe are called the milder ſort, of which I have had many under my care; and ſome of thoſe affecting the Breaſt I have palliated a long time with eaſie Remedies. If any man will, inſtead of <hi>mild</hi> or <hi>occult</hi> Cancers, call them <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> Cancers, I ſhall not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay him.</p>
                     <p>Such was the caſe of a Lady that laboured many years of an ulcerated Cancer. It had eat deep into her left Breaſt, and was fixed to the Ribs,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Varieties Cancers.</note> but not with much pain. In progreſs of time the Lips inverted, and united as it were, and lay covered with a cruſty Scab: the Humour in the mean while ſpent it ſelf upon the Nerves, and cauſed a Species of a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> in ſome parts of her Body, and the Gout in others. She lived long, and in her latter age tolerably healthfull.</p>
                     <p>Another perſon of great age hath laboured long of ſuch another Cancer in her right Breaſt. It lieth large and deep about the middle of it:<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> the whole Breaſt is hard and immovable. She enjoys a good health, and is like to live long for any thing of diſturbance ſhe at preſent ſuffereth by it.</p>
                     <p>It is not long ſince that Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and my ſelf were deſired to look upon a Gentlewoman's Breaſt in the City.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> We found a Tumour hard and fixed, which had been ſome years ulcerated, and was judged a Cancer by thoſe who had before ſeen it; but it was not painfull. We judged it a <hi>ſcir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhous Cancer,</hi> as indeed all the forementioned are, or at leaſt ſeem to partake much of a <hi>Scirrhus:</hi> yet by ill handling or increaſe of Acrimony they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently terminate in <hi>raging Cancers,</hi> and torment the Patient with exquiſite darting pains. Some Inſtances whereof I ſhall ſet down, to make the young Chirurgeon more cautious in undertaking the Cure of them.</p>
                     <p>An old Gentlewoman came to me with a Swelling behind the right Ear,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> ſuppoſing it the <hi>King's Evil.</hi> The Tumour was of the bigneſs of a Pigeon's
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95669:59"/>egg, but lay more flat: it was hard and fixed, of a dark red colour, with a pricking pain. I aſſured her Friends that the Swelling was cancerous, and gave them caution in applying Suppuratives. But there wanted not one who undertook the Cure by breaking of it; upon which it became more painfull. I was ſent for, and ſaw it ulcerated deep, with ſtinking Sloughs, and thick Lips ſtanding up. It was ſpred under her Ear, and ſo horribly painfull that ſhe ſeemed diſtracted therewith.</p>
                     <p>So a Girl of ten years old had a hard round Tumour in her left Cheek;<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> by the uſe of Diſcutients it heated and became painfull, that Eye inflamed, and the Temporal Muſcle ſwelled: it reached downward, and afflicted that Jaw and Tonſil, rotting the Bones underneath, without breaking the Skin. She loſt her Eye, and died ſoon after Lethargick.</p>
                     <p>A Lady coming to Town with a Swelling in her left Breaſt conſulted ſome of our Profeſſion,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> and at laſt me. She ſaid ſhe had ſome years ſince Kernels in her Breaſt, which were judged the <hi>King's Evil;</hi> upon conſideration of which ſhe was preſented to His <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> and touched. In progreſs of time they ſwelled, and, her Breaſt being extreamly painfull, ſhe deſired my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. The Swelling was large and round, and greatly inflamed, under which it was ſoft, and ſeemed to have Matter in it. The Parts more diſtant were hard, and ſeveral Tubercles lying under the Skin made it unequal: yet the Breaſt was not fixed. She urged me inſtantly to deliver my thoughts of it: which to decline, I turned from her, and told her Friend it was a Cancer, and that I ſaw no hopes to ſave her life but by cutting it off. He wiſhed me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how I delivered ſuch Judgment of it, two Chirurgeons having lately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her the contrary, they taking it for a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> But I, not being uſed to guide my Judgment by what others delivered, confirmed to him what I had before ſaid by a ſad prediction, which befell her within few weeks after. And indeed there was no way then to deal with it but by cutting off her Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>In another,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat.</note> who conſulted me about a pain in her Breaſt, I felt one of the Glands ſwelled. I adviſed her to refrain the handling it, and to avoid the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her ſelf too ſtreight. It lay ſome years quiet; but then the death of her Husband happening, and one affliction following another, and the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> ſtopping, the Humours fermented in this Gland, and afterwards the Breaſt ſwelled, and ſeemed to apoſtemate. Some were ſo wiſe as to aſſure her it was a ſimple Apoſtemation, and required Digeſtives: whoſe advice ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to follow, till ſhe became extreamly pained, and then ſhe ſent for me. It was without Inflammation, but ſwelled very big, and ſeemed to be full of Matter; yet was not without hard Tubercles and other Symptoms to ſhew it would terminate in a Cancer whenſoever it ſhould break. Therefore I refuſed to open it, but adviſed the beſt I could to give her eaſe, and promiſed to come to her, if after it brake ſhe would ſend to me. Some months after ſhe ſent for me, and ſhewed me a great quantity of curdled Matter newly burſt forth. The Breaſt was lank, but very hard Glands lay within, and in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Tumour there were ſome Tubercles that required to be era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. To which purpoſe I deſigned to have ſlit open the Abſceſs, and to have pulled away the cancerated Glands: but ſhe would not permit me ſo much as to inlarge the Orifice: upon which conſideration I left her. She ſent for another, who choſe rather to treat her the way ſhe deſired, then to leave her to other hands. She died within half a year after.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince a Clergy-man dwelling in the City brought his Wife to me with a painfull hard Swelling in one of the Glands of her left Breaſt.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat.</note> I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to forbear the uſe of all Cataplaſms or Emplaſters that might heat her Breaſt, and to dreſs it with <hi>valentia ſtrammonii:</hi> but ſhe was otherwiſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95669:59"/>and thereby increaſed her miſery. About half a year after ſhe came to me again with a ſtinking ſordid Ulcer, with Lips turned out, and the Breaſt fixed to the Ribs, with a hard unequal Swelling reaching to that Clavicle and ſide of the Neck, apoſtemated in ſome parts, and ulcerated in others. From the Pectoral Muſcle it crept up to the Shoulder, and affected the <hi>Axilla</hi> underneath; and by the Compreſſion of the Veſſels the upper part of the Arm ſwelled, and became ſcirrhous. From the Elbow downwards it was oedematous to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends. She paſſed under the endeavours of many eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons of the City, but died miſerably.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a ſort of bleeding Cancers, which become ſuch either from an eruption of ſome Veſſel, which makes a vent often at the Nipple or ſome other Pin-hole, the Breaſt remaining whole; or elſe from the ſpreading of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capillary Veſſels in a <hi>Fungus,</hi> which in ulcerated Cancers is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Theſe do very much ſpend the ſtrength of the Patient, ſo that they ſoon die exhauſted and tabid.</p>
                     <p>Cancers may alſo be ſaid to differ as they affect ſeveral Parts of the Body, as the Head, Face, Eyes, Noſe, the Palate, Tonſils, Throat, Tongue, Jaws, or Lips: in ſome of which they take their Original from ſmall hard Tubercles, or little Excreſcences, and in progreſs of time penetrate deep into them, or ſpread and invade the neighbouring Parts with a <hi>Fungus</hi> or looſe Fleſh, rotting the Bones under them.</p>
                     <p>Cancers affecting the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> and <hi>Podex</hi> may alſo be diſtinguiſhed as they are in the interiour or exteriour parts; or as they take their beginning from a Swelling, or Excreſcence: in both which caſes and places they are extremely painfull, and communicate their malignity both from within outward, and alſo from the external to the internal parts. Thoſe that poſſeſs the body of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> or the upper part of the <hi>Rectum inteſtinum,</hi> are not diſcovered till they have made ſome progreſs; in which caſes there is a bearing down, with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine.</p>
                     <p>And this was the caſe of a Country-Gentlewoman who came to <hi>London</hi> laſt Summer with great ſuppreſſion and difficulty of Urine,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat.</note> (ſhe ſuppoſed from the Stone.) Upon ſearch I felt two hard Glands <hi>in Vagina uteri:</hi> theſe preſſed upon the neck of the Bladder, and ſuppreſſed the Urine. The pains from hence were ſo like thoſe of the Stone in the Bladder, that Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> at firſt would not be diſſwaded from that opinion; but upon ſearch he found it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous. She, poor woman, rejoiced that it was not the Stone, and ſoon after returned homewards, but died by the way.</p>
                     <p>If they be ulcerated, a filthy <hi>Sanies</hi> will diſcover it. If it be in the <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum,</hi> the difficulty and pain in going to Stool will be exceeding great. If the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> be cancerated, there will be Fever; nauſeouſneſs, anxiety of minde. In ſome of thoſe who died ſo diſeaſed I have opened the Body, and found the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> preternaturally big and hard: in cutting into it, I have ſeen it all rotten. Thoſe in the more exteriour parts, whether it be of the Womb or <hi>Podex,</hi> are ſooner diſcovered, and the Patients are in a greater poſſibility of being eaſed of their pains.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of a Cancer may be taken from what I have already delivered of them. Whether they begin in a Tumour or Excreſcence,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> their firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is very ſmall: and according as the Humour is of which they are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo is their increaſe quick or ſlow, from the ſmalneſs of a Vetch to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Pompion. If the Matter be very corroſive, the pain is ſharp, (to uſe their own expreſſions) as if they were ſtruck with a dart. And theſe painfull Tumours have frequently a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> joyned with them, or are overſpred with an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi> And while they are thus inflamed, they will be ſoft underneath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95669:60"/>the Inflammation, ſo may be thought full of Matter; but if you then open them, they will onely gleet. If you aſſwage that heat, the ſame place indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates again. Yet I have frequently ſeen a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> ſuppurate in ſome part of the Cancer: and after the cutting off a Cancer I have found an Apoſtemation of well-concocted Matter in the body of it. And ſo it was in that Cancer my Friend Mr. <hi>Nurſe</hi> cut off in the preſence of Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of us. If pituitous Humours abound in the Body, an oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour many be found affecting ſome exteriour part of the cancerous Tumour: in which caſe the Swelling ſomewhat reſembles a Tumour made by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. Theſe are they that grow to ſuch a great bulk, and are pale or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, with a mixture of a brown colour, and have thoſe turgid Veins ſtretching over the Skin: whence Authours have likened them to Crabs, and theſe Veins to their Claws, and from thence impoſed upon them the name of <hi>Cancer.</hi> The many Tubercles lying under the Skin make the Tumour round and unequal: at laſt they break; and from that time, be the Matter much or little, they ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate, thruſt out hard painfull Lips, diſcharge a ſtinking Gleet, and fix to the Ribs, as if they were nailed to them, and in progreſs are of a horrible aſpect.</p>
                     <p>Of all the Diſeaſes which afflict mankind the <hi>Cancer</hi> is the moſt grievous and rebellious,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and is generally incurable, by reaſon of its corroſive and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign venom fermenting in the Humours, which, ſo far as we can yet find, yields neither to Purging, Bleeding, Repellents, Diſcutients, Suppuratives, nor any other Medicine inward or outward.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which lie ſuperficially under the Skin may be attempted by the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon's hand: or if they riſe from an external cauſe, as Bruiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they lie deeper, they may be cut off, or otherwiſe extirpated. But thoſe that ariſe from a corroſive quality in the Humours, though they may be cut off or otherwiſe extirpated, yet the ſucceſs is moſt doubtfull. Nor do Cancers in the Mouth or other internal Parts cicatrize well, though they be extirpated by Knife or Fire.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of a Cancer in general conſiſteth in theſe three Intentions:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> firſt, in the generation of good Bloud; ſecondly, in correcting and evacuating of the atrabilious Humours in the Body; thirdly, in preventing the growth of the Tumour, and diſpoſing it to Diſcuſſion.</p>
                     <p>We endeavour to perform the firſt Intention by an exact regulation in Diet and way of living, adviſing to abſtain from ſuch ſalt, ſharp and groſs Meats as may diſpoſe the Bloud to acrimony, and make choice of the contrary, ſuch as are cooling and moiſtning, of eaſie digeſtion and good nouriſhment, as hath been propoſed in the Chapter of a <hi>Scirrhus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention is, in preparing and purging off the acrimonious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. If there be <hi>Plethora,</hi> or a ſuppreſſion of the Haemorrhoids or <hi>Menſes,</hi> a Vein may be opened, and a Clyſter given. The Humours may alſo be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by lenient Purgatives, as <hi>decoct. epithymi, ſennae Gereonis:</hi> or this; ℞ <hi>flor. trium cordialium</hi> M. j. <hi>ſenae</hi>

                     <p>The third Intention is, to reſtrain the growth of the Tumour, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſcuſs it. Whilſt the Humours are evacuating, we apply Repellents, and afterward we adde Diſcutients. The Repellents ought to be of the milder ſort, leſt they render the Humours too groſs and unfit for Reſolution; as, <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuc. portulac. plantag. umbilic. Ven. ſolanum, ſempervivum,</hi> Lentils boiled in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, alſo Clay tempered with Vinegar.</p>

Frog-ſpawn-water is of good uſe in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, if cloaths be dipt in it and applied: but they ought to be ſhifted as they dry, and freſh ones applied. The often changing them in the Winter may cauſe the Patient to take cold, therefore you may apply then this or ſuch like Cerote: ℞ <hi>ranar. virid.</hi>

                     <p>The Diſcutients are Ceterach, Agrimony, <hi>lens paluſtris, ſcabioſ. ſtramonium, ſucc. coriandri, ranar. limac. cancror. fluviat.</hi> Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with Rue and Garden-Nightſhade into a Pultice are proper to reſolve them. Many ſuch like Medicaments are deſigned to this purpoſe; Cancers requiring variety of Applications.</p>
                     <p>If notwithſtanding all your endeavours the Tumour increaſe, and be like to ulcerate, you may doe well to forewarn the Patient of the danger: and if it be looſe, and in a place where it may be ſafely extirpated, propoſe it to them, leſt afterwards they deſire it when it is too late.</p>
                     <p>That you may be the more ſucceſsfull in the Operation, I ſhall offer to your conſideration theſe few Oualifications. Firſt, that the Patient be of a ſtrong Conſtitution, and of a tolerable good Habit of body, and not in a declining age, when the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are ceaſed. Secondly, that the Cancer be looſe, and the <hi>Axilla</hi> free from painfull Glands. It were alſo to be wiſhed that the Cancer took its Original from ſome Accident, as a Bruiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, that the Operation be performed in the Spring or Autumn of the year: leſt through the great heat of the Summer the Spirits be reſolved; or by reaſon of the extreme cold in the Winter the native Heat ſhould be choaked.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Operation you ought to have good Rowlers, Compreſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive Powders and Defenſatives, as in other Amputations. The uſe of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthum</hi> or other Eſcaroticks I do not approve: for you cannot apply them ſo to the mouths of the Arteries but they will corrode the adjacent Parts,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95669:61"/>and cauſe pain, which ought not to be, eſpecially in a Cancer. Beſides, they require a ſtrict Bandage, which is very troubleſome on the Breaſts. To avoid which inconveniences, I propoſe the ſtopping of the Bloud by a ſmall Button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauterie; which I acknowledg is not done without ſome pain, but that is momentary, and ſerves to correct the indiſpoſition of the Part: whereas the other lieth gnawing ſo long as it is upon the Part, and rendereth it crude and ill-diſpoſed. There ought to be actual Cauteries of different ſorts ready hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome corner of the Chamber, leſt in the Extirpation there happen to be left ſome reliques of a cancerous Gland behind. All things being ready, the Patient muſt be placed in a Chair to the light, and held ſteady. It is then at the Operatour's choice, whether he will make a Ligature about the <hi>baſis</hi> of the cancerous Tumour, or pull it to him with one hand while he cuts it off with the other. For the cutting into the Breaſt, and pulling out the cancera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Knot, rarely ſucceeds well: nor indeed is every Breaſt ſo capable of being freed of the Cancer when it is cut off by making a Ligature. If the Cancer be cut off clear, your buſineſs is then to ſtop the bloud as you pleaſe: but if any Scirrhoſity remain, you ſhall doe well to conſume it by actual Cauterie. The Ancients uſed in theſe Operations to permit them to bleed freely, nay provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them to it by cruſhing the bloud out; after which the actual Cautery was applied all over, then they dreſſed the Wound as a Burn: but according to my method <hi>pulv.

                     <p>Empiricks amongſt us brag much of their skill in curing of them; and, by the giving of <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Pill, or Opium mixed with ſome Purgative, they do now and then alleviate the pain, and thereby encourage diſeaſed people to commit themſelves into their hands, whom if they can perſwade to an Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95669:61"/>they get ſome money in hand: but their frequent miſcarriages in that work have taught the more prudent people to avoid them.</p>
                     <p>Some eminent Chirurgeons, I ſuppoſe, after a fruitleſs endeavour to cure them, have attempted the extirpating of them by Eſcaroticks. <hi>Guido</hi> hath commended to us Arſenick poudered and ſprinkled daily upon them, the Eſcar being firſt pulled off. <hi>Riverius</hi> in his Obſervations tells of a Cancer that was extirpated by this Application: ℞ <hi>aq. fortis</hi> ℥j. <hi>ſublimati crudi</hi> ℥viij. <hi>ſalis Armeniaci</hi> ℥ij. <hi>arſenici</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. Theſe are to be diſtilled <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> then the <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put mortuum</hi> poudered, and the like weight of Vinegar to be put thereto, and diſtilled again to the conſiſtence of a ſoft Paſte for uſe. <hi>Ol. arſenici, aq. regia, ol. vitrioli, lap. cauſtic.</hi> &amp;c. have been propoſed. When ſuch are applied, there will be need of good Defenſatives. By the authority of ſome of theſe Authours young Chirurgeons have been ſometimes engaged to their prejudice: and ſome years ſince an eminent Chirurgeon, ſince deceaſed, undertook the eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of an ulcerated Cancer in the Breaſt of a Woman that had ſtrength and courage to endure it. He applied the ſtrongeſt of the forementioned Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: they penetrated deep, and made great Sloughs, which he pulled off, and by repeating the Eſcaroticks raiſed new; but the uſe of them was not long continued: for the Gleet partaking of the Corroſives ulcerated the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Parts; and the Cancer was ſo enraged by the Eſcaroticks, as ſhewed there was no good to be done by them. Indeed if they had contrived Medicaments that could have penetrated deep with little pain, there might have been ſome hopes of ſucceſs. So cancerous Excreſcences and Ulcers in the Mouth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the touching them with <hi>ol. vitriol. ſulphur.</hi> &amp;c. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there remain but two waies, either the actual Cautery, or palliative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. If the Cancer be in ſuch a place as you may hope to eradicate it, the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cautery is then a ſure help: but not by applying it lightly upon the upper parts; but by thruſting at the root with a Scoop or Chiſel-like Cautery, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it away before you. If there remain any rags of it, with a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Button-cautery burn it down to a cruſt: but if this cannot be effected, then endeavour Palliation by ſuch Medicaments as above have been propoſed; and in caſe the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> or <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> be ſtopt, bleed by Venaeſection or by Leeches, and make Fontanels: for by ſuch means many people live tolerably well who have Cancers ulcerated; when others, who ailed leſs, by their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are dead. As you may ſee amongſt the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of about twenty years of age, of a healthfull Complexion,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland in the Breaſt.</note> came to me complaining of a pain in her Breaſt. I looked upon it, and felt a hard Gland of an oval figure movable. I adviſed her to keep her hands off of it, and to give her Breaſt what liberty ſhe could by cutting the Stiffning out of her Bodies, there being little more to be done in ſuch Tumours. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed her a Solution of <hi>ſacchar. Saturni in aq. ſpermat. ranar.</hi> to dip cloaths in, and apply to her Breaſt, in caſe of pain; adviſed her to bleed Spring and Autumn, to purge with Whey, <hi>Manna, cremor tartar.</hi> and to contemperate the Humours with clarified Whey, wherein Borrage, Bugloſs, Cichorie, Fumito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been boiled. Some time after, upon a new complaint, I added <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſ. cum opio</hi> to the former Water. By ſuch like Remedies ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with more quiet of mind many years, and with much eaſe, and hath lately recommended others to me upon the ſame account.</p>
                     <p>To another,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland in the left Breaſt.</note> very much pained with a Gland in her left Breaſt of the bigneſs of a Cheſnut, I preſcribed the dreſſing of her Breaſt with cloaths dipt in the forementioned Solution, and ſome days after let her bloud, and preſcribed an Electuary of <hi>caſſia, manna, pulp. tamarind. cum reſina jalapii &amp; ſal. tartari,</hi> to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95669:62"/>take the quantity of a Nutmeg at any time to keep her Body ſoluble. Her pain continuing, I preſcribed an Infuſion to be made of <hi>ſem. cydon. pſyllii, papaver. alb. hyoſcyam. in aq. ſolani &amp; plantag.</hi> She was purged with <hi>decoct. epithymi cum ſyr. de pomis purg.</hi> Barly-creams, Emulſions, with Cra-fiſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. After all ſhe removed into the freſh air, and drank the Waters of <hi>Barnes</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> by which ſhe was ſomewhat relieved: and by the repetition of the aboveſaid Preſcriptions the Gland continues quiet, and may to her death.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman came out of the Country with a cancerous Gland in her right Breaſt,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland in the right Breaſt.</note> ſhe ſuppoſing it was the <hi>Evil:</hi> but being informed what it was, ſhe deſired my advice. I preſcribed her ſuch like Medicaments to palliate it. She was after ſome while adviſed to conſult others. Some of them applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. galbani</hi> to it: from which time the pain increaſed, and the Breaſt ſwelled. She then returned to me. I anointed it with <hi>valentia ſtramonii,</hi> let her bloud, and purged her with Whey, Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which I calmed the Ferment, and ſhe returned into the Country well contented to palliate it, and by that Unguent it is quieted.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland behind the Ear. 5. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland in the left Breaſt.</note> pained with a cancerous Tumour behind her left Ear, was by the ſaid Oyntment palliated many years; and, for ought I know, is yet alive.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged about fifty years, of a Scorbutical and very ill Habit of body, had alſo a painfull Gland in her left Breaſt. Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> was her Phyſician, and commended the Cure of that ſwelled Gland to me. She was in a Scorbutical courſe of Phyſick, and had been let bloud by Leeches, Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels were made, and ſeveral Medicaments had been applied unſucceſsfully to her Breaſt. I applied this: ℞ <hi>ſevi vitulini</hi> ℥vj. <hi>unguent. roſati, popul. an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ol. myrtillor.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſucc. plantag. ſolani, geranii, an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſucc. rutae murariae, ſummit. rubi, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>lithargyr. aur.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>tutiae praeparatae, cancror. fluviatil. an.</hi>

S.

But of late years the Gland leſſened and reſolved. Some while after ſhe complained of a pain in her Back, and made bloudy water, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more foul, ſhe came to <hi>London.</hi> Her Phyſician being dead, ſhe conſulted others. They all ſuſpected an Ulcer in her Kidneys, treated her accordingly, and ſent her to <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> from whence ſhe returned little the better. She retired into the Country, and enjoys there a tolerable Health. I ſuppoſe this of her Kidneys is a Tranſlation of ſome of thoſe ſharp Humours which affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about fourty years of age,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gland in the Breaſt, the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by Cauſtick.</note> ſubject to the Gout and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, conſulted me about a ſmall painfull Gland lying ſuperficially under the Skin of her right Breaſt two fingers breadth above the Nipple, not bigger then a ſmall Hazel-nut. It was a <hi>Cancer incipiens,</hi> and like to be of ill quality, beginning with ſo much pain. I propoſed the palliating of it, or the taking of it out by Inciſion. To the former I rather enclined: ſhe replied, ſhe would have it broke, and cured by digeſtion. Some days after ſhe met with one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Cauſtick upon it, and treated it that way; and, being confident of the ſucceſs, ſhe ſent to me to ſee her dreſſed. I went, and ſaw the Ulcer in a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming good condition; but, in handling of it, I perceived part of the Gland remaining hard, which confirmed to me the unſucceſsfulneſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. He dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>Praecipitat, alb.</hi> upon Lint, and applied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it a piece of a boiled Tripe ſcraped thin, (as I was afterwards informed.)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95669:62"/>About ten weeks after the patient ſent for me. She was much emaciated, and her Breaſt ulcerated, and fixt to the Ribs, with inverted Lips, and a foetid Gleet iſſuing from it. I dreſſed her Breaſt with <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and applied on the Parts about it <hi>unguent. nutritum,</hi> preſcribing a Pearl-Julep to refreſh her fainting ſpirits, and an Anodyne draught that night to diſpoſe her to reſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>I fomented her Breaſt with a Decoction of ſome of the aboveſaid Plants, and with ſome of the Unguents preſcribed in the method of Cure of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ulcerated dreſſed her up, by which ſhe was reſtored to ſuch a condition as to return to her houſe in the Country. About half a year after her Phyſician writ to me, and by her order offered me a ſufficient Reward with convenience anſwerable to come to her. To which I returned for anſwer, That if he could propoſe how I might extirpate the Cancer or palliate it otherwiſe then I had directed her from hence, I would gladly make a Journey to her; otherwiſe I deſired to be excuſed. How long ſhe lived afterward, I have not heard.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour aged about thirty eight years was taken with a pain in her right Breaſt, ſhe thought from ſome Bruiſe.<note place="margin">7. Obſervat.</note> A while after ſhe felt a hardneſs two fingers breadth above the Nipple, which growing more painfull, ſhe put her ſelf into the hands of ſome who pretended to cure it: but the bloud burſt out at the Nipple the while, which eaſed her of the pain. During this the Nipple contracted inward, and by the large and frequent bleeding the Humours became ſharp, affecting her Kidneys, and at other times her Hands and Arms, with a <hi>Rheumatiſmus:</hi> meanwhile her Breaſt was eaſier. Thus ſhe ſuffered ſome years under the Fermentation of ſharp Humours in one part or other, but for the moſt part in her Breaſt, which in progreſs of time raiſed it into a great unequal Tumour of a brown and livid colour, with turgid Veins overſpreading it. Doctour <hi>Whiſtler</hi> had been often conſulted by her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her as often by Purging, Venaeſection, Leeches, Traumatick Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cancer growing great, and the Tubercles ready to disburthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the corrupt <hi>Serum</hi> which diſtended them, I was conſulted, and, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the danger the Patient was in, deſired a Conſultation, and that Dr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtler,</hi> who had diſcontinued his Viſits, might be preſent, with Sir <hi>Al. Fraſ.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Needham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> Chirurgeon, to joyn in the Conſultation. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we met, and conſidered the Cancer. It was of a very ill aſpect, ready to burſt, and not fixed. But I, apprehending that after its eruption it would fix, and rage, as is uſual at ſuch times, offered to their conſideration the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Breaſt while it was capable of it, leſt afterwards it ſhould be objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a fault. It ariſing from an outward cauſe, gave me the more encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the Patient not admitting of it, we conſulted how to treat it. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, Emulſions and Anodyne draughts were preſcribed; external Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were alſo conſidered to calm the heat of the Cancer. Some few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtinking Gleet burſt its way out in great quantity by a ſmall Opening, to the great eaſe of the Patient; upon which the Tubercles and Breaſt ſunk, and, after the caſting forth of ſome corrupt Sloughs, the Matter became well ſented,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95669:63"/>the Breaſt alſo contracting into an uniform ſhape, grew leſs then thè other, and the Patient recovered ſtrength to riſe out of her Bed. Doctour <hi>Whiſtler</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Cure, and by good Balſamicks, Traumatick Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Humours to better temper, inſomuch as the Lady appeared abroad, to the wonder of thoſe that had ſeen her ſome weeks before. She being ſo recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it became a queſtion whether it had ever been cancerated. But ſince that there have happened new Eruptions, and there yet remaineth ſuch hardneſs and inequality in it as will demonſtrate what it was.</p>
                     <p>The year before the Sickneſs a young Woman came to me complaining of a grievous pain in her right Breaſt.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat.</note> She was of a healthy Complexion, and her Breaſt ſeemed to look as well: but in handling of it I did feel a couple of hard Glands. She had conſulted others, and came to me to cut them out. I diſſwaded her at that time from ſuch thoughts, by telling her the inward Cauſe was firſt to be removed, and the Humours better diſpoſed. To which purpoſe ſhe was let bloud, purged with Infuſions of <hi>Sena,</hi> &amp;c. and adviſed to drink the Waters of <hi>Epſom</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge.</hi> I alſo directed her ſome of the Medicaments ſet down in the method of Cure, to alleviate her pain. Some weeks after ſhe came again, and told me ſhe was informed that ſhe ſhould not be eaſed of her pain till thoſe Knots were taken out. I told her thoſe Glands lay deep, and the muſculous Fleſh and Parts about were infected with the ſame Juices, and conſequently the Operation could not be ſucceſsfull unleſs the Breaſt were cut off. Upon which ſhe departed from me unſatisfied, and ſome days after put her ſelf into the hands of another, who cut out thoſe Glands, and endeavoured to cure. But it grew cancerous; and then he cut off the whole Breaſt. Some months after, when it was near cured, ſhe came and ſhewed it me with much joy. I felt it hard round about, and ſuſpected it would not cure; as indeed it did not: for ſome months after ſhe came again to me with it ulcerated deep and wide into the pectoral Muſcle and Parts about, and fixed to the Ribs. She grievouſly bemoaned her misfortune, in permitting it to be cut off. By this and ſuch like work I have been taught not to cut off Breaſts that cancerate from an internal Cauſe. I did what I could to eaſe her pain by palliating the Ulcer, but it was too late.</p>
                     <p>In the time of my waiting at the publick Healings there came to me a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-maid,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of a Cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Breaſt cut off.</note> aged about twenty ſix years, of a ſickly Complexion, diſeaſed with a Cancer in her right Breaſt ariſing from ſome accidental Bruiſe. It firſt ſwelled, then grew hard, and in progreſs of time ulcerated, and had frequently bled to the quantity of a quart at a time, and ſometime to two quarts, as her Friends told me. I conſidered the Breaſt as incurable, and judged the bleeding to ariſe from a <hi>Fungus</hi> which lay too deep to be reached by any Medicament: therefore thought it reaſonable to propoſe to them the extirpation of the Breaſt before it ſhould be fixed to the Ribs. They had tried many things unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Country: and, being now informed that it was not the <hi>King's Evil,</hi> they were not unwilling that it ſhould be cut off, but took time to conſider of it; and about a month after came to me again reſolved for the work.</p>
                     <p>The taking off of this Breaſt happened to be ſeaſonable for the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Royal Stiptick liquour which was given me the morning before by His <hi>MAJESTY</hi>'s command: upon which conſideration I provided no other Aſtringent then a couple of Buttons made of Lint which lay wet in a ſpoonfull of that Water. But, in order to the bringing the Lips of the Wound together, I had prepared a couple of Needles with a ſtrong twiſted Thread ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, alſo a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi,</hi> &amp;c. ſpred upon Pledgits, with Compreſs and Bandage. Being thus provided, I attended ſome Friends who deſired to ſee the efficacie of the Water. But Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> being
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95669:63"/>come, and it growing late in the evening, we proceeded in the work. He pulled up the Breaſt while I made a Ligature upon the <hi>baſis</hi> of it, and cut it off. The two Arteries bled forcibly out, till Doctour <hi>Needham</hi> applied a wet Button on the one, and my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſeman</hi> applied the other. That of the Doctour's ſtopt the Bleeding at that very inſtant, and the Compreſs adhered to it; but the bloud dribbled from under the other: which we ſuppoſed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by reaſon of the bloud ſtreaming upon it in the putting it on. But by the application of a freſh Button the Bleeding there alſo ſtopped. During this the Lips of the wound were brought nearer to each other by a croſs ſtitch. We then applied our Digeſtive with convenient Bandage over it, and laid the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in her Bed. In our abſence ſhe fainted, and upon the drinking a draught of cold water vomited, and her Breaſt bled through the Dreſſings. Upon ſight thereof I took off the Dreſſings, and ſeeing one of the Arteries ſeepe, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a freſh Doſſil, and ſtopt it: but it being night, and dreading miſchief might happen if it ſhould bleed again, I ſent for a ſmall Button-cautery, and that way ſecured it. The third day we took off Dreſſings, and found it well digeſted; and from that time it cured daily. But ſhe complained of a ſoarneſs of that ſide of her Throat, which ſhe had done ever ſince her Breaſt was cut off, and within a week after of a ſhortneſs of breath; upon which ſhe was let bloud; and by my Friend's preſcriptions ſhe was alſo purged with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſ. ſennae, rhabarb.</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards with <hi>pil. foetidae,</hi> &amp;c. Her Breaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near cicatrized, ſhe was ſupplied with Dreſſings, and returned to the Country the ſixth week after the cutting it off. But ſhe continued there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, and the <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of Humours, fretted off, and inlarged the Ulcer very much: whereupon ſhe returned to me again. I dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. and let her bloud; then purged her as aboveſaid, made her a Fontanel in her left Arm, and in few weeks ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrized her Breaſt. Since which time I have ſeen her often in Town in very good health, and her Breaſt firmly cicatrized, without pain or hardneſs.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about fifty years of age,<note place="margin">10. Obſervat.</note> having ſome ſcirrhous Glands in her left Breaſt, was impatient to have them diſcuſſed or ſuppurated: to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſhe conſulted ſeveral of our Profeſſion, and afterwards my ſelf. She was under the hands of ſome Empiricks, that were endeavouring by Pultices to break it: there was alſo a Fontanel made in the lower part of the Breaſt under the Tumour, ſhe hoping that way to ſpend it. I adviſed her to forbear the uſe of ſuch applications as might heat her Breaſt, telling her the ill conſequence in breaking thoſe Swellings. She did not approve of what I ſaid, but purſued her deſign. Some time after a falſe Suppuration was made in her Breaſt, and an effuſion of bloud followed; and by the continued uſe of Pultices the Ulcer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and by frequent Bleeding her Body emaciated. She being very near waſted by a new Eruption ſent for me. I ſtopped the Bleeding by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>pulv. ſang. dracon.</hi> with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. deſiccativum rubrum,</hi> with a ſoft cap of Tow preſſed out of <hi>Oxycrate.</hi> The next day I took off the Dreſſing, and found it had not bled. I alſo obſerved the Tumour to be a meer <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and the Ulcer an Excoriation of the Skin which encompaſſed it round, and the frequent Bleeding occaſioned by Eſcaroticks and hot Cataplaſms. I dreſſed the Breaſt with Epuloticks, as <hi>unguent. tutiae Vigonis,</hi> and ſuch like, and with cloaths dipt in <hi>aq. ſpermat. ranar.</hi> with <hi>ſacchar. Saturni;</hi> and in ſome parts I applied Pledgits dipt in the ſame, with a Solution of <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſ. cum opio,</hi> by which the heat was contemperated, and the Excoriation cicatrized. Sir <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> was in the while conſulted, and preſcribed her this; ℞ <hi>antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii diaphoretici</hi> gr. 15. <hi>magiſt. perlar.</hi> gr. 6. <hi>fol. auri num.</hi> j. <hi>Miſc. pro una doſi, &amp; ſic pro aliis; detur horis matutin. &amp; quartis pomeridianis, ſuperbibendo ſequent.

In the time of the Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by the application of Eſcaroticks and hard Bandage a Gland was raiſed under the right <hi>Axilla:</hi> but by forbearing the uſe of Bandage, and my dreſſing her Breaſt with Lenients, the pain therein ceaſed, and ſhe injoyed a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of health, and was my good Friend, till about a year after it was told her that one Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> who laboured of a Cancer in her Breaſt, had cauſed a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank to cut it off, and that ſhe was thereby cured. Upon this ſhe ſent for me, and would have her Breaſt cut off. I declined it, and ſhewed her, as I thought, ſuch reaſons as might have diſſwaded her from ſuch an Enterprize: but ſhe was reſolved, and, after I was gone, ſent for the Empirick, who undertook to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate it by Eſcaroticks: and ſhe bled to death in few days. I was ſent for; but, being out of Town, ſhe was dead before I came to her. If ſhe had not been in ſuch haſt, ſhe might have out-lived that Gentlewoman: for her Breaſt cancerated, and ſhe died within a few months after.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">11. Obſervat.</note> of a very ill Habit of body, from her very youth had a hard Gland on her right Side near her Breaſt: it had ſome pricking pain in it, but was movable: it ſeemed to me a <hi>Cancer incipiens.</hi> I was willing to apply ſomewhat to it, but, ſuſpecting that the increaſe of the Gland might be imputed to it, adviſed her to keep her hands off it, and to lace her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies more ſlack; telling her, that upon her return to <hi>London</hi> the Autumn fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, if ſhe were not better, ſhe might conſult thoſe of our Profeſſion. She did ſo, and accordingly as ſhe had propoſed came to Town again, and ſent for me. The Gland was then grown bigger and more painfull, but was movable: there was alſo a ſmall painfull Gland under that <hi>Axilla,</hi> which much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my undertaking. I acquainted her Phyſician of the danger ſhe was in, and wiſhed him to propoſe to her the conſulting ſome others. The next day Doctour <hi>Wharton</hi> met the Lady's Phyſician, Doctour <hi>Windebanck,</hi> and my ſelf. At the Conſultation I declared my thoughts of that Gland, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was a Cancer, and by the progreſs it had made in three months it was like to be a difficult work, and wiſhed the Patient might be acquainted with the danger; for by her diſcourſe to me ſhe expected I ſhould ſpeedily cure her, and that by ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Gland: which way was deſtructive. For, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> and our daily experience, <hi>ab emollientibus exaſperantur:</hi> and to proceed by Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and Diſcutients were onely to palliate; which I doubted we ſhould not be long able to doe. The onely hope then remaining was, cutting into the Skin, and taking the Gland out while it was movable. This was not approved of. We then conſidered what to dreſs it with. Doctour <hi>Wharton</hi> would needs leave that to my care: but I, having no inclination to be engaged in it, deſired it might be preſcribed by us, and made by the Apothecary; which was as followeth. ℞ <hi>aq. ſpermatis ranar.</hi>

When the Glands were not painfull, ſhe was ſick of ſome <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> Catarrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if ſhe was well in health, then the Glands were pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and while this bigger was treated, it would feel ſoft in ſome part, and be protuberant, and after a while harden again. Thus every new Fluxion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed this Gland, and gradually made it unequal; yet it continued movable: which gave me one time an occaſion to tell her, that the cutting the Skin, and taking that Gland out whole, was the beſt way to free her of it. She, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that I had no inclination to ſuppurate it, as ſhe hoped I would, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that I ſhould draw off, to make way for ſome other. About two months after I met with one that attended the Cure; who told me they had ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and were in hopes to cure. I replied, You will onely have a Gleet; as indeed it proved: and afterwards it thruſt out a large <hi>Fungus.</hi> She was then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have it cut off, but it was too late.</p>
                     <p>A Woman of about thirty ſix years of age was ſuppoſed to have a Cancer in her left Breaſt, and had been palliated many years by Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> One day,<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wen gangrened and cured.</note> ſhe being at her houſe in the Country, it did break, with very exceeding pain. She writ to her Phyſician, who ſent me to take off the Breaſt. When I came, I ſaw it gangrened, and was ſomewhat ſurprized at the novelty. The Tumour was round, of a very great bulk, and movable; it was gangrened by reaſon of the overſtretching of the Skin. The Mortification had eaten through the Skin the compaſs of the palm of a hand. I cut into the body of the Tumour, and found it a cancerous Fleſh, and lying within a <hi>Cyſtis.</hi> I, ſuppoſing it a cancerous Wen, (how properly I know not, it being the onely one I ever ſaw,) fomented it with Wine, dreſſed it up hot with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and gave her an ounce of <hi>ſyr. de meconio</hi> in a draught of Mace-ale, to quiet her pain. The next morning I found her much afflicted, and ſaw many cloaths wet with the Gleet, the Mortification was much ſpred in the Skin, and the cancerous body cracked as a Pomegranat over-ripe. I conſidered the Gangrene, and ſuppoſed it would ſave me the labour of cutting off the Breaſt, and that it would ceaſe upon the pulling away of the cancerous body. Upon which conſideration I pulled out that part which was outermoſt, I believe the fourth part of it; and would then have pulled it all out by dividing the Skin; but ſhe would not permit it. I continued my way of dreſſing as before, ſtay'd at the houſe with her three days, and dreſſed it twice a day, pulling out ſome part of the Wen each time. The Gangrene in the Skin ſtopped, and ſhe became very eaſie. But perceiving ſhe would not permit me to thruſt out the remaining Wen, I deſired a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Chirurgeon might be ſent for: who being come, we dreſſed the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I ſhewed him that by Digeſtion the remaining fleſhy body with the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis</hi> would come away, and by that time the Lips with the Skin would be ready to unite with the whole: which accordingly came to paſs, and ſhe was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured in leſs then ſix weeks, and is yet well.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about fifty years of age came to me out of the Country with a hard unequal Tumour, of the bigneſs of a large Wall-nut,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on the Head.</note> between the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Sagittal Suture: it had been ulcerated, but was at that time cruſted over with a Scab, and ſeemed to be a milder ſort of Cancer. He ſuppoſed it the <hi>King's Evil;</hi> but being aſſured by me otherwiſe, he deſired my help. I, conſidering its <hi>baſis</hi> reſting upon the <hi>Cranium,</hi> made no difficulty in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it. Therefore providing Dreſſings ready, I made an Inciſion round it to the Scull; then raiſed it off with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> and permitting the bloud to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95669:65"/>flow a while, dreſſed it up with Aſtringents. The third day after I took off Dreſſings, and ſaw the Lips of the Wound well diſpoſed, and the <hi>Cranium</hi> uncorrupted. I raſped it till the bloud appeared under it, then dreſſed up the Wound with Digeſtives <hi>ex terebinthina,</hi> &amp;c. and after Digeſtion incarned and cicatrized it with as little difficulty, and diſmiſſed him cured.</p>
                     <p>A Man about twenty eight years of age came out of the Country recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to me with a Cancer on his left Cheek,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of a Cancer on the left Cheek.</note> ſtretching it ſelf from that ſide of his Noſe cloſe under the lower Ey-lid to the external <hi>Canthus,</hi> ſo making a compaſs downwards. It was broad in its <hi>baſis,</hi> and roſe copped like a Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaf. It gleeted, and was accompanied with Inflammation and much pain. He had alſo ſome ſcirrhous Glands under that Jaw. The extirpation of this Cancer had been attempted in the Country; but it growing afterwards bigger, and threatning his Eye lately with Inflammation, he haſtned up, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me to undertake it. I complied with his deſire, and four or five days after, having prepared all things ready, <hi>viz.</hi> actual Cauteries, Digeſtives, Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being aſſiſting, I pulled the Tumour towards me with the one hand, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which I made my Inciſion cloſe by the Eye-lid, and cut it ſmooth off, as cloſe to the <hi>Os jugale</hi> as I could doe it, avoiding the <hi>Perioſteum.</hi> The bloud at firſt ſpurt out forcibly from many Capillaries beſides two conſiderable Arteries: we permitted them to bleed a while. The leſſer Veſſels ſtopped of themſelves, and we cauterized the greater afterwards. Then viewing our work, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome relique of the Cancer remaining above the external <hi>Canthus,</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed it by actual Cautery, and dreſſed up the Wound with our Digeſtive, with Embrocations, Defenſatives, and moderate Bandage to retain them. The third day we took off Dreſſings, ſaw it well diſpoſed to digeſt, and dreſſed it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The ſecond day after, dreſſing it again, the Cancer appeared riſing from the ſide of the Noſe and Eye-lid; it alſo over-ſpred the Cheek-bone. I dreſſed it as I had done the time before; and the next time came prepared with actual Cauteries, and conſumed it all, then dreſſed it up with Lenients. From that time the Ulcer healed daily, and contracted in ten days ſpace to the half: yet ſince that it begins to bud again here and there, which will put me upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing the actual Cautery: and what account to give of it I yet know not.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged about fourty years,<note place="margin">15. Obſervat. of a cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of the lower right Jaw.</note> of a ſtrong healthy Conſtitution, came out of the Country diſeaſed with a large fleſhy Excreſcence, painfull, and of a livid colour, thruſting out from the Gums of the lower right Jaw. It had rotted the Teeth neareſt to it, and weakened the reſt, by the Ulceration and Relaxation it had made in the Gums. It had been viewed by ſome of our Profeſſion, who declined the meddling with it as cancerous; for which reaſon I undertook it: for, ſuppoſing it a Cancer, it ought the rather to be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whilſt it affected ſome particular Part that was capable of it. The ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch omiſſions may be judged by the following Obſervations. I readily undertook the freeing her of the Excreſcence by actual Cautery: which ſhe conſenting to, I cauſed a Scoop-like Cautery to be made proportionably big, to thruſt off the Excreſcence at once with its root: then ſent for <hi>La Roche,</hi> who punched out the ſtumps of the Teeth that were in my way. Then, one of my Servants holding her Head ſteady whilſt another held her lower Lip down and her Tongue on one ſide, I preſſed with the Cautery well heated into the lower part of the Gum, and extirpated it quite; then with a Bolt-cautery conſumed and dried the lax and rotten <hi>baſis:</hi> which being done, ſhe held in her mouth a <hi>decoct. hordei cum ſem. cydonior.</hi> and uſed it daily till the Eſcar ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. I then made her a <hi>decoct. plantag. equiſet. ſummitat. rubi, flor. roſ. rub.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95669:65"/>balauſt. cum ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> with which and the Vitriol-ſtone I cicatrized the Ulcer firmly. I neither purged her, nor let her bloud; ſuppoſing the latter would be more ſeaſonable after in caſe of Inflammation: but there happening none, that was omitted. And ſo was the Purging, I ſuppoſing it might put the Humours rather upon a Ferment. She was cured in leſs then three weeks, and continueth well.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about fifty years of age, of a ſtrong Conſtitution,<note place="margin">16. Obſervat.</note> by cracking of an Apricock-ſtone cauſed a pain amongſt the great Teeth of his upper Jaw on the left ſide. From that time that part of the Gum ſwelled, and one Tooth grew looſe, and after ſome time a <hi>Fungus</hi> thruſt the Tooth out. A <hi>French-man,</hi> Chirurgeon to his Regiment, endeavoured to conſume the <hi>Fungus</hi> with <hi>oleum vitrioli</hi> and ſuch like: but it increaſing ſpred farther, and affected the whole Jaw, inſomuch as all his Teeth dropt out to the <hi>Septum.</hi> The <hi>Fungus</hi> greatly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thruſt out two diſtinct Lips, the one whereof ſtretched out the Cheek, and the other overſpred that ſide of the Roof of his mouth. The Patient being in this condition came up to <hi>London,</hi> and called to a Conſultation Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> and Doctour <hi>Bate</hi> Phyſicians: of Chirurgeons there were Mr. <hi>Arris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Molin</hi> (deceaſed,) Mr. <hi>Shunbub,</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> Chirurgeon to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Albemarl,</hi> Mr. <hi>Troutbeck,</hi> and my ſelf. We, being met, ſaw the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent dreſſed; his Chirurgeon pulling out a Tent very big and long from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two <hi>Fungi</hi> in that place where the Diſeaſe began. After we had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered the Malady, we withdrew to conſult, and, unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding it an ulcerated Cancer, propoſed various Remedies in order to Palliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as ſhaving the Hair of his head, applying Cephalicks, a Seton in the Neck, Fontanels, Bliſtering, Bleeding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Coming to the Patient with the Preſcriptions, he asked what way we had deſigned to cure him. After ſome pauſe, (for we, having no hopes of curing him, had not diſcourſed of that,) Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> anſwered, the attempt of Cure in ſuch Ulcers had been alwaies unſucceſsfull and extream painfull, <hi>viz.</hi> by Burning, and thereby the Diſeaſe hath been for the moſt part exaſperated, and the Life of the Patient ſhortned. The ſame was affirmed by us all. The Patient replied, God's will be done. I pray goe and conſider of the way: for I had rather die then live thus. We withdrew, and reſolved to comply with his deſire, returning ſuddenly again to him with that Anſwer, and commended to him Mr. <hi>Edward Molin,</hi> that excellent Operatour. But he refuſed it, as being preingaged to goe out of Town. It was then put upon me: and at their deſire I undertook it, and gave directions for the making actual Cauteries of various ſorts, ſome Bolt-like, others like Chiſels, others of other faſhions. There were Inſtruments alſo made to defend his Tongue and Lips. While theſe were making, the Patient was let bloud, purged, and prepared for the work. That done, we met again, and had the Inſtrument-maker attending to heat the Cauteries, and mend or alter them as occaſion ſhould offer. One of the Aſſiſtents held his Head and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip, whilſt I with a <hi>Speculum oris</hi> held down the Tongue with the one hand, and with the other paſſed a plain Chiſel-cautery juſt under the upper Lip into the body of that part of the Cancer which ſtretched it ſelf along the Roof of the mouth to the Palate, and repeated the uſe of that-faſhioned Cautery till I had made a ſeparation of ſo much. The carrying the Cautery thus in the middle of that cancerous Lip was the way to preſerve the ſound parts from being ſcorched with the reflexion of the glowing Iron. It was alſo a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Patient to ſee ſuch gobbets burnt off with ſo little pain. After I had ſcooped off what I could of that Lip, then with Olive and Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Cauteries by burning I dried up the remainder to a cruſt. That done, I went to work with the other cancerous Lip which lay ſtretched along that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95669:66"/>part of the Jaw to the Cheek, and raiſed it up as a Trumpeter's in the time of ſounding. I paſſed a Chiſel-cautery into the body of that, and made a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a great part of it, cutting and burning through the <hi>Alveoli,</hi> which were as rotten as dirt, till the Patient grew weary, and the Phyſicians thought it was enough for that time. We then gave him of this Lotion to hold in his Mouth to cool it: ℞ <hi>ſem. cydonior.</hi> ℥j. <hi>ſem. pſyllii &amp; papaver. albi an.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next day in the afternoon the two Phyſicians and ſome of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons met me at tha Patient's Chamber. He had ſlept well, and was for the work, he ſaid, placing himſelf very chearfully in the Light. Renewing my work, and feeling with my Finger the length of that Lip ſtretching by the Roof of the mouth, I felt a moiſture in a chink, which I ſearched with a Probe, and found a hollowneſs over the Roof, from whence there iſſued Matter. On the other ſide, which I burnt laſt, the Fleſh was high. I began with that over the Roof, and burnt all that part dry, and left it lying hollow like an Arch: then burnt the other ſide with Olive and Bolt-cauteries down towards the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Alveoli,</hi> and found the remaining Sockets full of the ſame looſe Fleſh. I burnt into each of them, and at the ſame time dried them what I could; and where-ever I ſaw any Excreſcence, I conſumed it, and thereby ſmoothed my work. It was not eaſie to diſtinguiſh the ſound from the unſound by reaſon of the ſwelling in the neighbouring Parts. It was alſo much more painfull to the Patient, as the ſenſe of the Nerves and Membranes were more exquiſite then that of the hard Lips which I conſumed the day before.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our Profeſſion, who at our firſt Conſultation had declared it an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Cancer, did afterwards, when they ſaw it cured, declare amongſt their Companions that it was no Cancer. Such an irreſiſtible Diſeaſe is a Cancer.</p>
                     <p>In the year ſixty eight the ſame perſon, being at his houſe in the Country, was taken with a Fever, which after ſome daies terminated by a <hi>Criſis</hi> in the outſide of the ſame Cheek from which the cancerated Jaw had been extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They dreſſed it with Pultices of Chick weed and the like, by which it ſuppurated, and diſcharged its thin Matter by ſmall Eruptions; the groſſer remaining rendred the Ulcer ſordid and callous. Upon which they ſent for a Chirurgeon, and afterwards for a Phyſician of that Country. They dreſſed it about half a year. It not yielding to their Applications, they conſulted me by a Letter: to which I returned Anſwer, that I ſuſpected it cancerous. Upon the receipt of it, he came to <hi>London,</hi> believing at the worſt I could burn it out. He here conſulted divers eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. It was now a Cancer, and indeed not capable of extirpation, having ſeized that ſide of his Throat. I attempted ſome part of it within by the actual Cautery: but it not ſucceeding, and I being ſoon after fetched into the Country, others were employed: but after all he languiſhed and died.</p>
                     <p>A Captain of a Company in one of His <hi>MAJESTY</hi>'s Regiments of Foot quartering in the North of <hi>England</hi> was troubled with a ſmall Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence under his Tongue.<note place="margin">17. Obſervat. of a Cancer under the Tongue.</note> He conſulted the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons in his neighbourhood: but it increaſing with pain, he was perſwaded by his Friends to come to <hi>London</hi> to me. But after he came to Town, he met with ſome who told him that ſuch a ſmall thing was not worth the troubling me. Upon which he went to ſome other, and, having got ſomewhat to dreſs it, he returned to his Command in ſome of the neighbouring Counties, and there fell into the Chirurgeons hands, where it increaſing and ſpreading much infected the internal ſalivary Glandules on both ſides the Tongue, all the lower left <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illa,</hi> and part of the right. 'Twas fixing upon the lower Lip, the Teeth all looſe, and ſome of them fallen out: there were alſo ſome Glands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out under the Jaws. In this condition he came to me. I acquainted his Friends that it was a Cancer, and incurable. If an attempt was to be made in hopes of Cure, it was to be by burning it out. They conſulted their Friends: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Doctour <hi>Tho. Cox,</hi> Doctour <hi>Walter-Needham</hi> and my ſelf met. It was concluded by them, that there was no other way or hopes to cure him: how that might ſucceed we doubted. If he would have it attempted, it ſhould be at his deſire, and not upon any aſſurance from us to cure him thereby: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was doubtfull. The next day he ſent for us to meet at his Chamber in order to the extirpation. Accordingly we met, and, having Mr. <hi>Goſling</hi> with us, and our actual Cauteries and all things ready, we placed the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in a clear light, then pulled out the Teeth that lay looſe, and as it were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the <hi>Fungus.</hi> Then having his Head held firm, and his lower Lip defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I paſſed in a plain Chiſel-cautery under the <hi>Fungus,</hi> as low as I could, to avoid ſcorching of the Lip, and thruſt it forward towards the Tongue, by which I brought off that <hi>Fungus</hi> and the rotten <hi>Alveoli</hi> at twice or thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Cautery; then with Bolt-cauteries dried the <hi>baſis</hi> to a cruſt. After
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95669:67"/>with a Scoop-cautery I made a thruſt at the <hi>Fungus</hi> over-ſpreading the left Jaw, and made ſeparation of that, and what was rotten of the <hi>Alveoli:</hi> then with Olive and Bolt-cauteries I dried that as well as he would permit, and left the reſt for the next day's work, giving him ſome <hi>decoct. hordei cum ſem. cydon. pſyllii, &amp; alb. ovor.</hi> beaten in it, to cool the heat in his Mouth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied on the outſide under his Chaps this Defenſative: ℞ <hi>boli armen. pulv.</hi> ℥j. <hi>pulv. flor. roſar. rubr. balauſt. ſumach, an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>gallar. pulv.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The next day we met again, and found our Patient much relieved with the good night's reſt he had got: he was chearfull, and reſolved for the work. I began with Bolt and Olive-cauteries to make an end of drying that <hi>Fungus</hi> on the left Jaw; which having done, I burnt the ſalivary Glands on both ſides of the Tongue: then I placed a Tin-inſtrument between the Tongue and the Excreſcence which was rooted on the <hi>Ranula,</hi> of the ſhape of a <hi>Criſta,</hi> thick and hard, bearing the Tip of the Tongue backward. The Tongue thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, I thruſt at the root of it with a Bolt-cautery, by which I eradicated and burnt it off. Having thus cleared the Mouth of the <hi>Fungi,</hi> I deſired the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians Judgment of it: they looked, and liked what was done: the Patient waſhed and cooled his Mouth with the ſame Lotion as before, and had liberty to repeat the uſe of the Opiate and Cordial.</p>
                     <p>The next day we met again, and found our Patient well ſatisfied with what had been done, it being onely ſtiff and hot, otherwiſe not painfull, and he could take his ſuſtenance with more eaſe and Guſto.

Yet long before that he admitted me to uſe the actual Cautery, but ſo ſparingly as it ſignified nothing. Indeed ſome Empiricks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him great hopes of Cure by their Specificks: but he languiſhed and died notwithſtanding all our endeavours.</p>
                     <p>Thus another perſon of about ſixty years of age,<note place="margin">18. Obſervat. of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer on the Tongue.</note> having been long diſeaſed with a Cancer on the left ſide of his Tongue, ſtaid in the Country till it had corrupted one half from the Root to the Tip of it, as alſo the <hi>Ranula</hi> and Salivals of that ſide, as well the external as internal parts. Then being at a loſs what to doe, he came up to <hi>London</hi> recommended to Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95669:67"/>Cure; who, ſeeing his caſe ſo deplorable, adviſed him to conſult others. He aſſenting to it, Doctour <hi>Micklethwait,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> and my ſelf met Doctour <hi>Needham.</hi> At a Conſultation we propoſed to palliate the Diſeaſe. But he declared to us that he came to Town with reſolution to have the Cure attempted, though he died under it. We endeavoured to diſſwade him from it; but he perſiſted earneſtly in the having it attempted: to which we at laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and agreed to cut off that part of his Tongue, and to cauterize the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Ulcer that lay on that ſide of his Mouth between that Jaw and his Tongue. To which purpoſe we preſently ſent for ſome actual Cauterie, and in the preſence of that Company I put into his Mouth a Raſpatory, and, fixing it between the Root of his Tongue and edge of that Tonſil, pulled away the corrupt Fleſh; and then with Olive-cauteries burnt that to a cruſt. Having, as we ſuppoſed, conſumed the Cancer there, I paſſed a Probe with a Ligature into the Ulcer under the Tongue, and brought it out above through a Tubercle; then, pulling his Tongue forward, I cut off the cancerated part as it lay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its length, from the Tip to the Root of the Tongue: and after I had permitted it a while to bleed, I cauterized it. We then gave him of a <hi>decoct. hordei, cydon.</hi> &amp;c. to cool his Mouth, and treated him as hath been ſaid in the preceding Obſervation. In this Patient the Eſcars ſeparated, and the Ulcers digeſted, and that part of the Tongue near the Tonſil cicatrized; but the while a hard Swelling aroſe in his right Thigh, and became ſo painfull, that he was forced to keep his Bed: the Matter fermented alſo in the ſalival Glands, and made Apoſtemations on the outſide under the Jaws: of which together he languiſhed and died.</p>
                     <p>Theſe unſucceſsfull attempts may render us extream cruel to thoſe who feel not the miſery thoſe poor creatures ſuffer with Cancers in their Mouths.</p>
                     <p>If the Cancer be but in ſome particular part, as the Tongue, Gum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the Patients have no certain hopes of being cured by knife or Fire, yet they generally put it to trial ſooner or later. How much more then ſhall theſe poor creatures, who have Cancers overſpreading their Mouth, eating and gnawing the Fleſh, Nerves and Bones? who, beſides the danger they are in every minute of being choaked with a fierce Catarrh, do ſuffer hunger and thirſt; and if they can ſwallow Broth, Caudle or Drink, yet is it with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury taſt, by reaſon of its paſſing through ſuch ſore corrupt Parts, form which putrefaction their ſtomach nauſeates its ſuſtenance, and their Spirits are infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſtink, whence Fainting frequently happens; Sleep is a ſtranger to their eyes, their Slumber very troubleſome, and Death is onely their deſire. At ſuch a time as this it is not to be wondred if they try a doubtfull Remedy, though painfull. What I have attempted of this kind hath been at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt of the Patients and their Friends, and by the authority of a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. That the Cure ſucceeded not, muſt be imputed to the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe, and may teach others how dangerous it is to neglect the conſulting the experienced Chirurgeon while the Diſeaſe is recent, and eaſie to be eradicated.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of</hi> Noli me tangere.</head>
                     <p>AUthours in thier Chapter of <hi>Cancer</hi> do uſually mention <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> and <hi>Lupus.</hi> Theſe two moſt men eſteem to be but particular names of a Cancer when it is fixed in ſome peculiar place: as in the Face, Noſe or Lip it is called <hi>Noli me tangere;</hi> in the Legs and Shins, <hi>Lupus.</hi> Whence it is plain that our vulgar language uſeth the name of <hi>Wolf</hi> in a large ſenſe, applying it very often to the Breaſts, and indeed any other place, where the Cancer grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth highly corroſive. I ſhall think it more inſtructive to the young Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if I appropriate this word <hi>Noli me gangere</hi> to a ſmall round acuminated Tubercle,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> which hath not much pain, unleſs it be touched or rubbed, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exaſperated by Topicks. Concerning which <hi>Rogerus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Cancer plus corrodit uno die quàm Noli me tangere in uno menſe.</hi> But if ſo exaſperated, it is immediately enraged, and becomes a true Cancer. Such as theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in the Face and Lips; but do likewiſe happen in all other parts of the Body. I have ſeen them in the Arm. Particularly a perſon of about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, of a healthy Conſtitution, hath one in the outſide of his right Arm, a little above the Elbow. He weareth a Cup upon it of a light wood, with Straps faſtned to it, which brace it on, and defend the Part from the preſſure of his Sleeve. He ſent for me one morning to ſee it when he was in bed, his Arm lying out covered with a light mantle. He turned up his Sleeve, took off the Cup, and ſhewed it me. The Tubercle was ſmall, of a blewiſh colour, and looked as if it had been a <hi>Varix:</hi> it was without Inflammation, hardneſs, or change of colour in the Parts about it. He did not permit me to look long upon it: the while I did, I ſaw it riſe into a Tumour as big as a Kernel of a Hazel-nut. Such another I ſaw in the Arm of a Woman of about fourty years of age, of a blew colour, on the outſide of her Arm: but it was not defended from the preſſure of her Sleeve. I offered to undertake the Cure of them both; but they had been diſſwaded by moſt of thoſe that had ſeen them. I ſhould not have doubted of good Succeſs, having before ſeen a perſon ſo diſeaſed and cured by an Eminent Chirurgeon in his time, who by the application of an actual Cauterie burned it to the Fleſh, ſuppoſing it had lain no deeper; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeparation of the Eſcar it riſing again, he burned it deeper, and from that time it returned no more.</p>
                     <p>WHile I was attending a Noble Family in the Country,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> a Perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the neighbourhood ſent his onely Daughter of about eleven years of age to me. She was diſeaſed with an unequal Tubercle upon her left Cheek, of the compaſs of a half Guinny when undiſturbed; but if any thing were applied to it, it heated the whole Cheek. It was a great blemiſh to her Beauty, upon which very account her Parents had much endeavoured to have it cured, or at leaſt to be diſpoſed to ſuch a calm temper, as it might bear a black Patch. Some weeks after the Lady her Mother brought her to <hi>London,</hi> and put her into the care of the late deceaſed Doctour <hi>Stanly</hi> and my ſelf. He purged her with this: ℞ <hi>fol. ſenae</hi>

                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:95669:68"/>were alſo given her at diſtinct times, and diſtilled Milks, ſuch as have been ſet down in the Cure of Cancers. I begun my Application with this; ℞ <hi>litharg. uuri</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſem. cucurbit. excorticat.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>aceti vini q. ſ. nutriatur in mortario in formam unguenti, addendo camph. diſſolut. in aq. roſ.</hi> gr. vj. This was applied ſpred thin upon Sarſenet: but it immediately ſwelled and heated all the Cheek. I then took it off, and anointed the inflamed parts about the Tubercle: but it did not agree with it. We wiped it off again, and by expoſing it to the air it cooled, and returned in a day or two to its former temper. After I had tried ſeveral Medicaments unſucceſsfully, a Friend gave me a black concreted Juice to work into a Paſte to cover the Diſeaſe, it being all the Mother then deſired from me: and this being laid upon it, adhered to it as if it had been Pitch, and ſeemed to agree well with it. But after four or five daies it heated her Cheek, and was taken off. Upon which the Mother grew impatient, and had ſome thoughts of going with her Daughter into <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire</hi> to a man there who pretends to the Cure of Cancers. Which coming to my knowledge, I made an offer to Doctour <hi>Stanly</hi> to undertake the Cure by extirpating that Tubercle by the actual Cautery. But he replying, that the very mention of it would fright them out of Town; I then propoſed it by Cauſtick to the Lady-mother: which ſhe accepted, upon a promiſe not to doe it whilſt ſhe was in Town, nor then till I heard from her in the Country. Some while after ſhe went into the Country, and wrote to ſome of her Friends to ſee the work done. Upon the receipt of which I met Doctour <hi>Stanly</hi> and them; and, having placed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in a clear light, I drew a Line with ink how far I intended to burn, and they took the compaſs exactly in a piece of paper, which they kept. I began with a Cauſtick-ſtone pointed, and preſſed upon the middle of the Tubercle, burning deep into it; and, to quicken the work, I touched it with <hi>ol. vitrioli</hi> upon a Stick, and then with the Cauſtick-ſtone interchangeably, till I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Tubercle and the parts within the marked Line. The while I was thus working, I dried up the Salts which mixed with the <hi>Ichor</hi> with armed Probes. Having thus finiſhed the work as I deſigned, to the ſatisfaction of the Phyſician and Relations, I waſhed out the Salts of the Cauſtick with Wine warmed, then divided the Eſcar, and waſhed it again with Milk, till I had freed the Eſcar and the Part from pain: then I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum oleo roſ.</hi> on a Pledgit, and applied an <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> overall. By theſe Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents the Eſcar ſeparated, and left a deep round Ulcer: which in few days I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted with <hi>unguent. baſilic. mag. &amp; Merc. praecip.</hi> and incarned and cicatrized with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. but within ten days after it broke out again. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Purging with <hi>calomel. Bezoard. miner.</hi> &amp;c. and healed it up with a firm <hi>Cicatrix</hi> by the aforeſaid method, adding a few drops of <hi>tinct. vitrioli dulc. in aqua rubi.</hi> From which time it hath continued well, ſhe not having worn any Mouch upon it of late years. I have now under cure one of this kind; but, it not being perfected, I ſhall inſert it in the Treatiſe of <hi>Strumae.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of Wateriſh Tumours.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>WAteriſh</hi> or <hi>Hydropical</hi> Tumours are the effects of an extravaſated <hi>Serum,</hi> which according to the place on which it lights doth denominate the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>If it fall inwardly into the Cavities of the Belly, it is <hi>Hydrops aſcites;</hi> of the <hi>Thorax, Hydrops pecioris;</hi> of the Scull, <hi>Hydrocephalus:</hi> which name it alſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95669:69"/>retains if it affect the outward parts of the Head. When it is lodged between the Skin and the Fleſh, or in the Interſtices of the Muſcles, it is <hi>Anaſarca;</hi> in the <hi>Scrotum, Hydrocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Wateriſh Tumours that are external differ from the phlegmatick by their ſhining and the manner of their pitting.<note place="margin">Differences.</note> Hydropical Swellings, if they be pure, do gliſter and are pellucid, they take impreſſion eaſily, and do as ſoon loſe it. <hi>Oedemata</hi> receive the impreſſion eaſily alſo, but they keep it longer. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency in the ſurface or change from the natural colour in the Skin is leſs then in the other. But theſe Humours are very apt to mix both in the <hi>Anaſarca</hi> and other Swellings; which where they do, the Symptoms are confounded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aſcites</hi> differs from <hi>Tympanites</hi> by its weight, and the ſwagging of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Belly; whereas the Tumour in a <hi>Tympanites</hi> is more light, equal, hard, and, ſay Authours, ſounds like a Drum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Wateriſh Tumours are whatever may either increaſe the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud beyond its proportion,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> or reſtrain it in any part of the Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally, ſo that, wanting its natural courſe, it ſtagnates in ſome one or more places. Of the former ſort are ill Digeſtion in the Stomach; defect of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification, which is frequent in intemperate perſons; alſo great Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, where the Bloud, being weakened by much diminution of its quantity, is not able to digeſt the Aliments aſſumed, but lets them run into <hi>Serum,</hi> from which Cauſe alone ſeveral wateriſh Tumours ariſe; ſo alſo any defect in the Ferments of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> as when the Kidneys do not ſeparate the <hi>Serum</hi> from the Bloud, or the conglobate Glands doe not their office; likewiſe too great acrimony in the Bloud, which, though hot in it ſelf, yet melts down the Bloud into a thin <hi>Serum,</hi> as in hot Catarrhs. Of the latter ſort are, 1. a check of tranſpiration through the Pores of the Skin, which keeps in a greater part of the thinner <hi>Serum,</hi> and forceth it to ſtop in the body: 2. retention of Urine: 3. the forming of ſome <hi>Cyſtis</hi> in which it is contained: 4. its extravaſation in any part of the body, external or internal.</p>
                     <p>Wateriſh Tumours are, as we have reckoned, internal, or external.</p>
                     <p>The internal ones are deſcribed in Phyſik-books;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and their <hi>Signs</hi> ſhall be given particularly by me as I have occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The external, if they be pure indeed and very much external, do by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſplendency betray themſelves to the eye; thoſe eſpecially that lie near the <hi>Cuticula</hi> and <hi>Cutis</hi> making a very thin pellucid Tumour. Thoſe that lie dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under the Skin do ſhine leſs: yet in ſome of them, if in a dark room you ſhade them, as women do an Egge with their hands, and hold a Candle to the other ſide, you will find at leaſt a faint tranſparency. Thoſe that lie yet dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or are contained in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> do not diſcolour the Skin at all, nor cauſe any conſiderable pain: but if the Swelling be large, you may by ſhaking it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an undulation.</p>
                     <p>Waterie Tumours as ſuch portend no danger to the life of the Patient,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> unleſs the <hi>Viſcera</hi> be obſtructed or otherwiſe tainted. If ſuch Obſtructions or Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happen, the meaſure of the danger is to be taken from the degree of the Corruption. Thoſe inward Tumours are more dangerous then the outward; and the more noble the Part affected, the more important the danger.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Tumours there are four Intentions required.<note place="margin">Cure.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt conſiſts in a requlation of Diet and manner of living: the ſecond, in evacuation of thoſe ſerous Humours by Stool, Urine, or Tranſpiration: the third, in rectifying the Concoction, and reſtoring the <hi>Viſcera</hi> to their natural ſtate: the fourth, concerning the Tumour it ſelf, is performed by Diſcutients and Exſiccants, or by Apertion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Diet ought to be with great moderation, exceſs in eating or drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95669:69"/>being prejudicial to their Cure. As to the quality of it, Phyſicians gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preſcribe it drying and attenuating, ſuch as hath been propoſed in the Chapter of <hi>Oedema;</hi> and after that manner they ought to regulate their way of living: yet it is not unfrequent to ſee theſe Tumours ariſe from a hot Cauſe, in which caſe cooling Diets are requiſite.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Intention is uſually performed by Purging with ſuch things as are preſcribed in Oedematous caſes. Onely here there ought to be a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard had to the <hi>Hydragoga,</hi> as <hi>elaterium, camboya, ſambucus, ebulus, rad. bryoniae, ſyr. de ſpina cervina,</hi> &amp;c. If the Cauſe be hot, Bleeding and <hi>Barnet</hi> Waters may be neceſſary, of which you may find ſome Inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Intention of reſtoring or rectifying the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> ought to be the work of the Phyſician.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth Intention is, of removing the conjunct matter by drying and diſcutient Medicaments; for which all thoſe ſet down in Oedematous and Flatulent Tumours are ſuitable. ℞ <hi>ſummitat. abrotoni, abſinth. origani, cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minth. majoranae, an.</hi> M. ij. <hi>flor. ſambuci, chamaem. anthos, roſ. rub. an.</hi> M. j. <hi>baccar. lauri, juniperi, an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>coquantur in ſ. q. aquaefont.</hi> to which may be added Wine, Vinegar, Salt, Sulphur, or Alume. Or you may make the Decoction in the common Lixivie, if the Tumour require it. You may alſo embrocate with ſuch like; ℞ <hi>ſalis nitri</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>x. <hi>piperis albi</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>euphorb.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>ol. laurin.</hi> ℥vj. <hi>Miſc.</hi> and apply this over the Part affected; ℞ <hi>ſem. aniſi, cumini, bacc. myrtil. lauri, an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ſucci ebuli</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>ol. rutac. &amp; cerae q. ſ. fiat Ceratum.</hi> If by application of theſe or the like Medicaments the Cure ſucceed not, it may be reaſonable to make Apertion, and give vent to the Water, and proceed in the Cure as ſhall be ſhewed in the following Obſervations. Where the <hi>Hydrops</hi> hath affected the Breaſt, I have not ſeen any operation attempted by letting out the Water, the Diſeaſe it ſelf being rarely diſcovered till after the death of the Patient. In ſome ſuch I have taken out about a gallon. Nor is there often found better ſucceſs where the Water affects the Belly, as in the <hi>Aſcites:</hi> it being for the moſt part the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of long chronick Diſeaſes, which either took their original from or ended in Obſtructions of the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> in which caſes the Cure uſually depends upon the Phyſician; the beſt aſſiſtence of the Chirurgeon being that of Bandage, which, if applied even to the whole Belly by a ſtrong Dimitee or <hi>Holland</hi> Bracer, made to encompaſs the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and tied or laced behind, may conduce much to the prevention of a ſudden increaſe of the Swelling.</p>
                     <p>The like or greater ſucceſs we may hope for in Anaſarcous Swellings, where the Legs, Arms, Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are affected, to which a ſtreight Stocking, Sleeve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being accommodated doth uſually repreſs the Humour, and diſpoſe it to be carried off another way by Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Where the <hi>Aſcites</hi> follows <hi>Haemorrhagiae,</hi> Fever, or any acute Diſeaſe, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits more often of Cure: but thoſe of our Profeſſion are rarely conſulted while there is any hopes thereof by internal Remedies, which is ſo long as the Patient hath ſtrength to bear them. At laſt, when the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are tainted, the evacuation of the Water haſtens their deaths, and the Operation is ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized: whereas if the <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> were made in time, better ſucceſs might be expected.</p>
                     <p>The way of making a <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> or Tapping hath been variouſly ſet down, according to the ſeveral fancies of Chirurgeons. Some have made the Apertion in the Navel by Bodkin, Needle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others three fingers below it on either Side, chuſing that on which the Patient did leaſt lie; for the Orifice ought to lie uppermoſt, to prevent too great an effuſion. Thoſe that open below the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel have likewiſe deviſed ſeveral ways. Some take up the Skin, and perforate that firſt; then make a Perforation in the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> A method not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95669:70"/>where the Belly is very hard and ſtiff with much Fat between the Skin and Muſcles. Therefore it is that we generally ſtrike through all at once. The worſt way is by Cauſtick, and Inciſion after that.</p>
                     <p>But the downright Puncture, being the beſt of Cures, is to be ſo managed as that the <hi>Serum</hi> may not fly out all at once, but be retained according to the deſire of the Chirurgeon; nothing being ſo pernicious to the Patient as great Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though of an excrementitious Humour. Hence it is that much Art hath been uſed in this affair as to deſignation of quantity and contrivance of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Barbett</hi> hath lately publiſhed the uſe of an hollow Needle, which, being thruſt in, will let out what quantity you pleaſe, but being pulled out leaves little or no paſſage in the Skin. The repeated intruſion of this into the ſame or into freſh holes (ſay he and <hi>Sylvius</hi>) will evacuate Water at your pleaſure. Truly, the whilſt the Belly is diſtended with abundance of Water, it may ſucceed well: but they themſelves dare not pretend farther then the Evacuation of half the Liquour, for by that time you will be in danger of wounding the Inteſtines. Several Experiments I have made of that Inſtrument, and one lately, rather to ſatisfie the Patient and his Relations that the Swelling was an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> then that we could propoſe any Cure by it. I made the Apertion in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Hollier:</hi> we diſcharged about a pint of Water, and part of that by a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for, feeling ſome oppoſition in the cavity within the <hi>Abdomen</hi> which obſtructed the flowing of the Water, I pulled the pointed <hi>Cannula</hi> out: and it was well I did, for afterwards in opening the dead body I found the Inteſtines floating above the Water, though there were above two gallons in the Belly. Upon which Obſervations I do conclude it a very unfit Inſtrument to diſcharge a Dropſie: beſides, our people will not admit of ſo many Openings as would be neceſſary to empty an Hydropicall Belly. This very perſon, as earneſt as he was at firſt for the Operation, choſe rather to die with the Water in his Belly then ſuffer a ſecond Apertion.</p>
                     <p>I therefore do conclude the good old way of a <hi>Cannula</hi> made taper-wiſe with holes in the ſide, whoſe deſcription you may finde in <hi>Pareus,</hi> to be the beſt; which being conveyed through a hole made by puncture may be kept in by Bandage till the Water be evacuated, the hole of it being ſtopped by a Screw or otherwiſe, as you will find in the aforeſaid Authour. I ſhall now give you ſome Obſervations of this Work, though it be for the moſt part unſucceſsfull: as indeed what can be expected from rotten <hi>Viſcera?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Woman near fifty years of age, of a groſs body and ſtrong Conſtitution,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
                        </note> laboured of an <hi>Aſcites</hi> a long time: after much Phyſick ineffectually taken, the Water burſt its way through the Skin by a ſmall Opening on her right Side, near the place where we uſually make the <hi>Paracenteſis;</hi> and after ſome days, the Aperture wearing larger, the Water flowed more abundantly. I was fetched, and ſtopt up the Orifice with a Tent of Lint, applying a Pitch-plaiſter, and over that another of Yeaſt and Wheat-flower, with Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Then I adviſed her to lie on the contrary Side, by which that part was kept dry. The fourth day I opened it, and gave vent by a <hi>Cannula</hi> to three pints of Water; then bound it up again. As the Belly emptied, the Opening contracted: Therefore I put in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> retaining it in with Compreſs and Bracer, and thereby diſcharged the Water at pleaſure, and afterwards left it to her own and her Servants ordering. I viſited her ſome while after; and, finding moſt part of the Water diſcharged, I took out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and permitted it to cure. The Water ſeeped out ſometime upon riſing or lying on that Side; but ſhe was a ſtrong Woman, and recovered.</p>
                     <p>A young Man of about eighteen years of age fell from a Fever into a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95669:70"/>Ague,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
                        </note> which held him long, and ended in an <hi>Aſcites:</hi> his Belly ſwelled exceedingly, and he became extenuated. While he languiſhed in this deplorable condition, one undertook the Cure of him, by letting out the Water with a Thorn thruſt into his Navel, (though it were not at all ſwelled up.) The Water was let out gradually, and a ſticking Plaiſter onely applied over it. Thus in a month's ſpace it was evacuated, and the Belly contracted proportionably. During this Evacuation he took opening Broths and Apozemes. After the Water was diſcharged, and the Puncture cured, he continued extreamly ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, and the Skin of his body and lims was withered; yet he was ordered to be let bloud about ſix ounces: at which time he was ſo very a Skeleton, and his Skin hung ſo looſe, that I doubted how I could hold it over the Vein to open it. Yet after this I ſaw him fat, and perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about thirty eight years old laboured of an <hi>Aſcites</hi> with Anaſarcous Swellings on her Belly,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
                        </note> Thighs and Legs; and, having taken much Phyſick unſucceſsfully in the Town, was removed to her houſe in the Country to die: but after ſome while being tired with the weight and ſtretching pain of her Belly, ſhe ſent for me to give vent to the Water. I went provided for the work, and found the Patient reſolved to undergoe the Opening. Other Symptoms to encourage me I had none. The next morning, ſhe having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her ſelf, and being placed on that ſide ſhe could beſt lie upon during the Evacuation, her Bracer being well fitted, I made the Perforation according to cuſtome three fingers below the Navell on the upper ſide. The Water ſpurted out forcibly whilſt I paſſed in my taper-pointed <hi>Cannula,</hi> which fitting exactly, I let out about three pints of Water, then apply'd an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> over it, with a Stupe wrung out of a carminative Decoction and Bandage. She ſeemed ſomewhat relieved at the preſent, but reſted ill that night, and was much indiſpoſed in the morning, yet would have more Water let out. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged two quarts of Water, and dreſſed it as before.</p>
                     <p>After I had continued there three or four days, and ſhewed the Servants the manner of letting out the Water and dreſſing, I returned to <hi>London.</hi> After a few days, going back, and finding her Belly very much ſunk, and the Water not over-ready to flow, I took out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> over it, with a warm Stupe and Bracer as before. I left her weak and not like to recover; and indeed ſhe died a few days after.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about thirty years of age, big with Child,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of <hi>Anaſarca</hi> in the Legs, &amp;c.</note> was much diſeaſed with Anaſarcous Swellings in her Legs and Feet. Sr. <hi>Fr. Pr.</hi> was ſent for; who, ſeeing her in ſuch a condition, and unfit to take Phyſick, deſired my Opinion concerning them. I ſaw the Swellings pale and ſhining, yielding to the impreſſion of my fingers, and returning ſlowly. She was very uneaſie in her bed, and not in a condition to ſit up. I propoſed Fomenting with good diſcutient and exſiccant Medicaments, to diſpoſe them for Bandage, and then to put on laced Stockings and Trouzes. After he had a while conſidered of it, he wiſhed me to write a form of the Fomentation; which I did thus: ℞ <hi>ſummitat. abſinthii, majoranae, origani, roriſmarin. an.</hi> M. iiij. <hi>flor. chamaemeli, ſambuci, roſ. rub. an.</hi> M. ij. <hi>baccar. lauri, juniperi, an.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>ſulph. vivi, aluminis rup. an.</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs. <hi>ſalis com.</hi> M. iij. <hi>coq. in ſ. q. aquae pro uſu.</hi> He gave way to the uſe of it and the Bandage. I began the next morning with the Fomentation, cauſing her Legs to be bathed, then rowled them up from the Feet above the Knees equally ſtreight. After I had repeated this method three or four days, and diſpoſed her Legs by Bandage for the laced Stockings, I ſaw them laced on with Knee-pieces and Trouzes: theſe were daily ſtreightned to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the Patient could eaſily bear. By the wearing of theſe ſhe recovered
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95669:71"/>the uſe of her Legs, to the great advantage of her health. She went her full time, and was delivered of a healthfull Child, which is yet alive.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman having long laboured under a complication of Diſeaſes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a Dropſy,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of <hi>Anaſarca</hi> of the Legs.</note> ſent for me. I found his Body much extenuated, his Legs Anaſarcous, and his Back and Hips excoriated with lying in bed. I propoſed to him to uſe of a Fomentation and equall Bandage, <hi>viz.</hi> a pair of laced Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. After ſome reaſoning with me about the uſe of them, he complied, and I cauſed a pair to be made, and laced them on. They were eaſy, and did all I deſigned by them. He was able to walk to his Cloſet, and take the air in his Coach, and was well pleaſed with them. But afterwards, being informed by ſome body of great inconveniences that might happen to him from the wearing of them, he cauſed them to be pulled off; upon which his Legs ſwelled again, and he was confined to his bed, whereby his Hips and Back galled: alſo by reaſon of the great increaſe of thoſe wateriſh Swellings the native heat was overcome, and a preternatural one ariſing inflamed and bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered them. I was fetched, and by Fomentations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> got off the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſix weeks healed the Ulcer and Ulcerations. I made him a Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell by Inciſion in his right Leg, and put him on the laced Stockings again, by the uſe of which he recovered.</p>
                     <p>A young Woman of about twenty five years of age,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of a watery Tumour in the Back.</note> of a healthfull Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, came to me out of the Country, ſuppoſed to have the <hi>King's Evill.</hi> Upon enquiry I found none of that <hi>Evill,</hi> but a large Tumour lying upon the Muſcles of the Back: the Skin of the Tumour was thick, without inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or diſcolouring.</p>
                     <p>I was then in queſt of windy Tumours, and thought this might be one, having Symptoms not unlike it, the Sound excepted. I had a great deſire to ſee what it was which made that bulk, and offered her the Cure of it <hi>gratis;</hi> which ſhe gladly accepting, I ordered my Servants to make ready Aſtringents and Bandage. Then I made an Apertion into it with a Knife, upon which a Water forced out: we received it in a Chamber-pot. Whilſt it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, I ſlit up the Tumour, and gave way to the Dregs, which were like Honey, but not contained in a <hi>Cyſtis.</hi> I cut off as much of the Skin as was ſuperfluent, and brought the reſt together, dreſſing it up with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex Terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. with a reſtrictive Emplaſter, Compreſſe and Bandage. Being thus dreſſed ſhe walked with her She-friend, more briskly then ſhe came, to her lodging in <hi>Shoe-lane;</hi> from whence ſhe came to my houſe the third day after, to be dreſſed, and ſo daily till the Wound was cured; which healed by Agglutination in leſs then three weeks.</p>
                     <p>OF Wateriſh Tumours <hi>Hydrocele</hi> is one very remarkable Species,<note place="margin">Hydrocele.</note> which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divides it ſelf into many others.</p>
                     <p>It may be generally defined,<note place="margin">Definition. Differences.</note> a wateriſh Swelling of the <hi>Scrotum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be either part of another more general Tumour, or elſe an original Diſeaſe of that place. When it is part of another Tumour, the Body is Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, <hi>viz.</hi> either Anaſarcous or Aſciticall: in both which caſes it is frequent to ſee the Cod ſwelled up after the manner of an <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> And indeed, when in Aſciticall caſes we find a Swelling of the Teſticle, there is for the moſt part an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> of the lower parts of the Belly joyned with it. When it is an original Tumour of the Part, it either lieth without the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> affecting the whole <hi>Scrotum;</hi> or elſe is contained within the ſaid Tunicle, or at leaſt in a <hi>Cyſtis</hi> of its own: in which caſe you will find one ſide ſwelled whilſt the other remains in its natural ſtate; or if both Teſticles are concerned, the Tumours are diſtinct.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Hydrocele</hi> are the ſame with thoſe of a Dropſy,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> at leaſt when it is part of a Dropſy. But when it cometh alone, it is generated as all other wateriſh Tumours are, <hi>viz.</hi> by a ſeparation of <hi>Serum</hi> out of the Arteries, which never returneth into the Veins, but lodgeth in the Skin or other parts of the Body. This Extravaſation may be cauſed from ſome Bruiſe by Blow, Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Signs</hi> of an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> may be taken from the diſtemper of them. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Anaſarcous <hi>Hydrocele</hi> may be known by the ſplendour, ſoftneſs and thickneſs of the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> It taketh impreſſion from the fingers eaſily, and may be wrought like ſoft Wax. The Prepuce is uſually ſwelled, if it attend the Dropſy of that name.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſimple <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> as it affects the whole <hi>Scrotum,</hi> fills it like a Bladder, and diſcovers it ſelf by its ſhining.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Hydrocele</hi> lieth within the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> between it and the Teſticles, or in a peculiar <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> the <hi>Scrotum</hi> is proportionably ſtretched, and ſomewhat wrinkled; and indeed at firſt ſight it is not unlike an <hi>Hernia inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> or <hi>zirbalis:</hi> but you may diſtinguiſh them by preſſing with your fingers upon the Production, which when you doe, bid the Patient cough; if nothing preſs upon your hand like wind, it is an <hi>Hydrocele.</hi> If the Water be lodged in the <hi>Tunica vaginalis</hi> of both Teſticles, the Swelling appears double.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is more or leſs dangerous according as it is complicated<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> That which is joyned with Dropſie cannot be cured, unleſs that be firſt cured: yet it ſometimes ſerves to diſcharge anaſarcous Swellings in the Parts lying above it. Thoſe which ariſe from an external Cauſe are more eaſily cured. If the Habit of body be tolerably good, the <hi>Hydrocele</hi> may be cured; and if it be bad, the Water may be let out as often as it fills, without danger.<note place="margin">Cure.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Tumours there is required a regulation in Diet and manner of living, as hath been ſet down in the preceding Diſcourſe of <hi>Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Tumours</hi> in generall: onely here they are to be proportioned according to the greatneſs of the Malady and the Accidents that attend them. They alſo require to be treated with ſuch Diſcutients and Exſiccants as have been there propoſed, and you muſt retain your Applications cloſe to the Part to which they are applied. A Bag-truſs is neceſſary, it ſerving alſo to ſuſtain the Part, leſt by the weight of the Humour the Tumour be increaſed: alſo after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Water it furthers the corrugation of the <hi>Scrotum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While the Swellings are ſmall, they may haply yield to Diſcutients. An accidentall Bruiſe, by ſtirring up an Inflammation, hath ſometime diſpoſed them to Diſcuſſion. If they tend to Suppuration, further it by Suppuratives, as in a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> hath been ſhewed, and treat them as ſuch. But if the Tumour have any quantity of Water in it, your ſpeedieſt way of Cure is by giving vent. if it be an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> that poſſeſſeth the whole <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the way to diſcharge it is either by Scarification, or by a Seton.</p>
                     <p>Scarification is proper when onely the <hi>Scrotum</hi> is Anaſarcous. If it be made by puncture with a Lancet, the Water will diſcharge in few hours, and the Wounds agglutinate ſoon after without other Application then a warm Stupe. An Inſtance whereof you may ſee in the Obſervations of <hi>Oedema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If there be an <hi>Anarſaca</hi> of the Belly, the Seton is moſt proper, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the time which is required for ſuch an Evacuation. It ought to be made tranſverſe the <hi>Scrotum</hi> in the depending part. It is to be kept open till the Seroſity be diſcharged; and the while you are to preſerve the native heat of the Part by the application of warm Stupes wrung out of Wine wherein have been boiled <hi>ſummitat. abſinthii, majoranae, flor. chamaem. roſ. rub. balauſt. bacc. myrtill. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> &amp;c. And take care leſt the <hi>Scrotum</hi> excoriate from the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95669:72"/>ſharpneſs of the Humour and inflame: for in Hydropical bodies it is apt to gangrene. If you apprehend ſuch miſchief, pull out the Seton.</p>
                     <p>In the Opening the other Species of <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> you are to conſider the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, and the place it is lodged in. If it have not a pint of Water in it, forbear opening it till it be bigger, leſt you hurt the Teſticle: beſides, it is not worth the while. But if it be a Child that labours of it, you may open it though there be ſcarce half a pint of Water. In order to the Opening them, you are to place the Patient in a clear light: then with the one hand to preſs upon the Production, that the Tumour may be more tenſe: and if the <hi>Hydrocele</hi> be in a Man, your Servant ought to preſs with his hand upon the other ſide, that the <hi>Scrotum</hi> may be the more ſteady. You are to make the Puncture in the depending Part, and avoid the cutting of the greater Veins lying upon the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> leſt thereby the Water be made bloudy, and you be thought to have hurt ſome Part within. You are to make the Apertion big enough to receive a ſmall <hi>Cannula,</hi> which you are immediately to put in, and keep it there till you have drawn out all the Water. That done, apply a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and an Emplaſter to retain it on, with a Flanell Stupe wrung out of an aſtringent Decoction, and put ſuch a Bag-truſs on as may keep your Dreſſings cloſe. By this method you will in two or three days find the Puncture cured, and the <hi>Scrotum</hi> contracted. Yet it may be reaſonable to apply an <hi>Emplaſtr. Caeſaris,</hi> or ſome other aſtringent Emplaſter, over the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and to put on a leſs Truſs, which the Patient may wear for more ſecurity. For they are apt to fill again with Water once in a year or two, if the Habit of body abound with ſerous Humours.</p>
                     <p>If the Water be lodged in a <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> or within the proper Coats of the Teſticle or Teſticles, they require accordingly to be opened diſtinctly. And in theſe <hi>Hydrocele's</hi> you are to be carefull to paſs in your <hi>Cannula,</hi> and keep it in till the laſt drop of Water be diſcharged: for if by any accident it ſlip out, you will ſcarce get it in again; the inner Tunicle hanging looſe, the holes may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer each other; nor is the Tumour capable of being opened ſo well again as at firſt: and if you leave any Water behind, the Operation will be thought ill done. The Water diſcharged, you are to proceed in the Cure as above ſaid. What hath been hitherto delivered of theſe <hi>Hydrocele's</hi> doth onely concern the palliative Cure.</p>
                     <p>If you purpoſe the perfect Cure, you ought then to make the Apertion large on one ſide of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> reaching towards the Production, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it may lie according to the length of the Teſticle, that you may open it after the Water is diſcharged, and thereby the better apply your Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it in caſe it be affected. In theſe Operations the Patient ſhould be of a tolerable good Habit of body, and not in his declining age: for whether they be made by Inciſion or Cauſtick, they are generally ſubject to Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Colick and Fever, till Suppuration be made. In which caſe Bleeding and Clyſters are neceſſary, and outwardly Lenients and Anodynes are to be applied, alſo good Fomentations to keep up the naturall heat: of which you will find ſome Inſtances amongſt the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A Boy of about ſix or ſeven years old was brought to me labouring of an <hi>Aſcites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia aquoſa</hi> with an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> and <hi>Aſcites.</hi>
                        </note> with an <hi>Hernia aquoſa in Scroto,</hi> and Anaſarcous Swellings poſſeſſing the outſide of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and Prepuce. I made an Apertion on the left ſide of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> in a depending Part, and, paſſing in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> diſcharged near a pint of Water; then fomented it with warm Stupes wrung out of red Wine. While I was fomenting it, ſuſpecting the Anaſarcous Humour would ſoon fill up the <hi>Scrotum</hi> again, if the Apertion were not kept open, I therefore without
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95669:72"/>delay thruſt a Seton-needle with a ſmall twiſt of Silk through the Aperture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made, and paſſed it out tranſverſe the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> about an inch diſtant from the firſt opening; then cut off the Seton from the Needle, and tied the ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, faſtening them with an Emplaſter above upon the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and truſſed it cloſe with a warm Flanell Stupe, covering alſo the <hi>Penis,</hi> and diſmiſſed them with directions to ſtupe it at leaſt thrice a day with a <hi>Decoct. abſinth. flor. roſ. rub.</hi> &amp;c. as it is propoſed in the method of Cure. If in this caſe the Stupes be not often ſhifted, the ſerous Humour, which ſo continually drops into it, will excoriate the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and ſtir up a painful Inflammation. Some few days after I viſited the Patient, and ſaw the Swelling in the Prepuce and <hi>Scrotum</hi> diſcuſſed, the Seton having well diſcharged its part. I cut out the Seton, and dreſſed the Ulcers with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> by which they healed; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe of the Fomentation in a few days the <hi>Scrotum</hi> contracted.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about ſixty years old came to <hi>London</hi> diſeaſed with a <hi>Hernia aquoſa.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia aquoſa</hi> with <hi>Anaſarca.</hi>
                        </note> The lower parts of his Belly and upper parts of his Thighs were Anaſarcous: the Prepuce and <hi>Scrotum</hi> were not free of it. Sr. <hi>Fr. Pr.</hi> being his Phyſician adviſed the opening of the Tumour, and was preſent the next day: where, having all things ready, I placed the Patient in a Chair to the light, the Phyſician laying his hand upon one ſide of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> while mine was on the other ſide. I made a Puncture in a declining Part, then paſſed in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> and let out about three pints of Water in a Baſon. I was much of the colour of Urine in healthfull people. The Water diſcharged, I pulled out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and applied a warm Stupe, and truſſed it up cloſe. In the ſpace of two or three days the <hi>Anaſarca</hi> diſcuſſed, and the <hi>Scrotum</hi> contracted and cured. I applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. Caeſaris</hi> over the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and fitted him with a Truſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Two years after I opened this Tumour again.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of an <hi>Aſcites</hi> with Anaſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <hi>in Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> &amp;c.</note> of a ſtrong Conſtitution and ſanguine Complexion, being of late years Aſthmatick, was about two months ſince ſwelled with an <hi>Aſcites</hi> and an <hi>Anaſarca</hi> of his Belly, <hi>Scrotum,</hi> Thighs and Legs. Dr. <hi>Denton</hi> and Dr. <hi>Brook</hi> were his Phyſicians, and conſulted me in the Chirurgery, eſpecially in that of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which was very much diſtended (as we ſuppoſed) with Water, the external parts being (as I have ſaid) Anaſarcous.</p>
                     <p>I propoſed Scarification in order to the preſent diſcharge of the <hi>Anaſarca:</hi> but, in conſideration of the neceſſity that appeared of continuing a vent to the ſerous Humours, which would moſt certainly affect the <hi>Scrotum</hi> whilſt any thing of the <hi>Hydrops</hi> remained in the parts above, we reſolved upon the uſe of a Seton. To which purpoſe the Patient was ſeated upon the ſide of his Bed, and a Baſon placed under the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> I raiſed up the Anaſarcous Skin, and, whilſt Dr. <hi>Brook</hi> held part of it, paſſed through the Needle with a twiſted Silk. Immediately upon the Apertion there diſcharged a bloudy <hi>Serum,</hi> (as it ſeemed to us by the candle-light,) which we permitted to flow to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of at leaſt a pint and a half: during which the colour not changing, we ſtept to the window with the Baſon, and ſaw it a pure florid bloud; ſo alſo was that which flowed the while into a Porrenger. Upon ſight whereof I pull'd out the Seton, and placed a Servant's fingers upon the two Apertions, till I haſtily made Dreſſings ready of <hi>farin. tritic. cum albumine ovor.</hi> ſpred upon a couple of Pledgits and upon linen cloath in the form of a Plaiſter, which I applied upon that part of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> with Compreſſe and Bandage, whereby the bleeding was ſtopt. We did not perceive that he was the leaſt diſcompoſed by the Evacuation. The ſecond day after we met again, and ſaw the Patient walking in his Chamber marvellouſly relieved both in his breath and ſtrength. He formerly took his reſt by leaning upon his Knees and Elbows; but that night he ſlept lying down in his Bed, and had diſcharged in our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95669:73"/>above a gallon of Urine well coloured, and made more then a quart du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our being in the houſe. In the taking off Dreſſings the Apertions were ſeemingly healed, and had not bled one drop after the application of thoſe Emplaſters. We fomented the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and truſſed it up. His Phyſicians preſcribed antiſcorbutical Juices, cordiall Juleps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond day after we met again, and, ſeeing the <hi>Scrotum</hi> big, made Scarification by puncture of a Lancet. The bloud trickled down apace; but after a while it ſtopt, and a <hi>Serum</hi> flowed forth. A warm Stupe was applied, and renewed often, and continued the moſt part of that night; during which the <hi>Serum</hi> was plentifully diſcharged, and he urined well. At our next meeting, which was within two or three days, we found our Cure ſucceed well; but the <hi>Scrotum</hi> was big, and likely to be ſo whilſt there remained any Water in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Parts about. Upon which conſideration we were inclined to make a Seton again: but, ſuſpecting a new effuſion of bloud, we contented our ſelves at that time in making an Apertion with that Spear-pointed <hi>Cannula</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Barbett.</hi> It bled at firſt opening about two ounces, then gleeted a ſerous Humour. We dreſſed it as before, and thereby the <hi>Serum</hi> was diſcharged for the ſpace of three or four days; during which the Patient removed from his Lodging at <hi>Lime-houſe</hi> into the Town, nearer his Phyſicians. Then we again pierced the <hi>Scrotum</hi> with a round Needle and twiſted Silk, whereby the bleeding was reſtrained and the Seroſity diſcharged: but the <hi>Scrotum</hi> from that time began to indurate, and thereby ſtreightned the Seton, and ſtopt the Water in its paſſage. Upon ſight whereof we fomented the <hi>Scrotum</hi> with Emollients and Diſcutients, <hi>viz. ex foliis &amp; radic. althaeae, bryoniae, cucumeris ſylveſt. ſummitat. ebuli, flor. ſambuci, ſem. foenugrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> &amp;c. and of the <hi>Faeces</hi> made a Cataplaſm, with an addition of <hi>farin. hord, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, axung. porcin.</hi> &amp;c. During theſe Applications the Patient was purged with <hi>Hydragoga</hi> once in two days, whereby great quantities of wateriſh Humours were each time evacuated. The Juices were alſo repeated thoſe days he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted Purging. Thus the Patient was daily relieved, the heardneſs <hi>in Scroto</hi> reſolving as the Seton digeſted, and indeed the <hi>Scrotum</hi> was well-nigh reſtored to its naturall bigneſs. We then deſigned Scarification of his Legs, to evacuate that <hi>Serum:</hi> but he not permitting it, we fomented them with Diſcutients, and embrocating afterwards <hi>cum oleo olivar. aceto &amp; ſale,</hi> we rowled them from the Toes upwards; and having that way diſpoſed the Parts for ſtreight Stockings, we laced them on, and fitted laced Trouzes to the Thighs. During which the Patient was frequently purged to much advantage; yet the ſwelled Thighs and Legs did not yield to our Bandage, but continued hard and painfull. He was alſo ſtreightned in breathing, and often delirous, and too much debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bear ſo frequent Purging as was requiſite to evacuate the daily increaſe of Water. Upon which conſideration we ſcarified his Legs and Feet, and by the application of Cupping-glaſſes diſcharged a quantity of bloudy <hi>Serum:</hi> from which time the evacuation of <hi>Serum</hi> was continued by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of warm Stupes and Emplaſters. About ten days after, having notice that his Legs and Feet were exceeding painfull, I made him a viſit, and found him upon his Feet: his Stockings being pull'd off, I ſaw his Legs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and in one place livid, and the very Toes inflamed, alſo bliſtered, and in ſome parts livid. I ſcarified them, and fomented them with <hi>decoct. ſummit. abſinth. flor. roſ. balauſt. in vino rubro;</hi> then dreſſed the Scarification with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> hot, and applied <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> with moderate expulſive Bandage from the Feet to the Knees; then put him into Bed, placing his Legs upon Pillows, to prevent the deſcent of Humours. The next day the Patient was let bloud about ten ounces; from which time he began again to urine plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby was freed of the <hi>Delirium</hi> and difficulty of breathing, the Inflammations of his Legs and Feet went off, and thoſe Ulcerations healed:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95669:73"/>yet there afterwards appeared a ſmall collection of Matter upon one of his Legs; which being diſcharged, and diſpoſed to cure, the Patient was again purged, and is at this preſent in a hopefull way of Recovery, his Belly, Thighs and Legs being ſoft, and in a manner reſtored to their natural ſtate, and his Phyſicians are ſending him into the freſh Air to perfect his health.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about twenty ſeven years of age came to <hi>London</hi> diſeaſed with a Swelling <hi>in Scroto.</hi> Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> was his Phyſician.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
                        </note> It was ſoft, and poſſeſt the Tunicles of the right Teſticle, making a Swelling onely in that Teſticle. It did not ſhine, as the ſimple <hi>Hernia aquoſa</hi> is wont to do. We made Compreſſion upon the Production of that Teſticle, and concluded the Tumour water, and lodged within the proper Coats of that Teſticle, the other lying unconcerned. We made an Apertion in the declining Part, and, paſſing in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> diſcharged about a quart of Water, all that was in the <hi>Scrotum:</hi> then pulled out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and an Emplaſter to retain it on, with a hot Stupe wrung out of Wine, and truſſed it up cloſe. By which method of dreſſing the Puncture cured, the <hi>Scrotum</hi> contracted, and he returned cured.</p>
                     <p>A perſon aged fifty eight years,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
                        </note> having been long troubled with a large Tumour <hi>in Scroto,</hi> deſired my advice. The Production of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> on the right ſide was much dilated. I preſt upon it with my hand, and upon his Coughing felt nothing of Wind. That Teſticle was lodged within the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſo as I could not feel it. The Tumour was ſoft and without pain. I concluded the Diſeaſe to be Water lodged within the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> or ſome particular <hi>Cyſtis</hi> encompaſſing the Teſticle; the other Teſticle and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction being unconcerned, and the <hi>Scrotum</hi> thick, as is uſually in ſuch caſes.</p>
                     <p>I propoſed the letting out of the Water; but he deſired time to conſider of it. After two or three days I was ſent for again, where I met Sir <hi>Charles Scarburgh,</hi> Phyſician to his Royall Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and one of his MAJESTIE's Phyſicians, and Doctour <hi>Denton.</hi> We together conſidered the Tumour; and they, being ſatisfied that it was Water, encouraged the Patient to admit of the Opening of it. I, having all things ready, made a Puncture in a declining Part, and, paſſing in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> diſcharged near two quarts of Water, dreſſing it up as above ſaid. I opened this Tumour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards twice in the ſpace of four years.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about ſixty years of age, labouring of an <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> was commended to me by Doctour <hi>Moriſon,</hi> his MAJESTIE's Botanick.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
                        </note> The Swelling was within the Tunicles of the right Teſticle, the <hi>Scrotum</hi> thick. I let out the Water by Puncture and <hi>Cannula;</hi> it was about a quart; then dreſt it as above ſaid, and the third day applied a reſtrictive Emplaſter over it, with Compreſs and Bag-truſs, and within a few days after diſmiſſed him cured of his Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>A year after or thereabouts the aforeſaid perſon came to me again, the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> being replete with Water. I opened it, diſcharged the Water, and dreſſed it as above ſaid, and thought him well, and gone out of Town. But after ſome days, accidentally hearing he was ſick and kept his bed, I haſtned to him, and found him afflicted with a Colick and Fever: the <hi>Scrotum</hi> was alſo ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and inflamed. I ordered him a Clyſter, let him bould, and applied an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Cataplaſm. By theſe means the pain was mitigated, and the accidents of Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ceaſed: but the <hi>Scrotum</hi> remained relaxed and big. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I applied Cataplaſms powerfully diſcutient, <hi>ex rad. bryoniae, fol. cicutae, flor. cham. ſambuci, ſem. foenugraec.</hi> &amp;c. by which the Swelling leſſened. He being in haſt to go out of Town, I ſupplied him with Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95669:74"/>to dreſs himſelf, by which the Tumour was diſcuſſed. He hath not been troubled with that watery Swelling ſince.</p>
                     <p>A perſon having a Swelling in the left Teſticle deſired my Opinion of it. The Tumour was ſoft,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>
                        </note> and of the bigneſs of a Gooſe-egge, without Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or pain, the <hi>Scrotum</hi> it ſelf not much concerned. I, ſuppoſing it an <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele,</hi> and within ſome of the proper Coats of that Teſticle, adviſed him to truſs it up cloſe, and in caſe it grew bigger, I would open it; for at that time there was not half a pint of Water in it. After a year or more, this perſon in riding bruiſed the ſame Part againſt the Pummel of his Saddle; it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly became painfull and hard. He came to <hi>London,</hi> and ſent for me. It ſeemed to me then to be in a capacity of diſcuſſion by reaſon of the acceſſe of heat: to which purpoſe I preſcribed this Fomentation: ℞ <hi>fol. hyoſcyami, cicutae, an.</hi> M. ij. <hi>fol. malv. biſmalv. an.</hi> M. j. <hi>flor. cham. ſambuci, an.</hi> M. ſs. <hi>rad. bryon. &amp; lilior. an.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>ſem. lini &amp; foenugraeci an.</hi> ℥ij. theſe to be decocted <hi>in brodio ex capite &amp; pedibus ovinis,</hi> and the <hi>Faeces</hi> made into a Cataplaſm, with the addition of <hi>medulla panis tritic. mel comm. &amp; axung. porcin.</hi> By the application of theſe emollient and reſolvent Medicaments the hardneſs and Swelling were removed, and the Teſticle reduced to its natural ſtate.</p>
                     <p>One between forty and fifty years of age,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of an <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> of a full Body, came with his Chirurgeon to conſult me concerning ſome kind of <hi>Hernia</hi> which of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>in Scroto,</hi> and was ſince by accident of Bruiſe much increaſed. At ſight of the Tumour it appeared to be overſpred with an <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> and I ſuppoſed the Humour within it to be an extravaſated <hi>Serum.</hi> I adviſed a diſcutient and exſiccant Fomentation and Emplaſter, alſo a Bag-truſs. Some little while after, ſeeing the Extravaſation diſcuſſed, and the Tumour inconſiderable, I adviſed the continuance of the Truſſe. About a month after we viſited the Patient, and ſaw the Tumour very large and tenſe, and by holding a lighted Candle on one ſide it appeared ſplendent. We concluded it an <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> and propoſed the Opening of it: but the Patient at that time declined it; and ſome while after his Chirurgeon aſſured me that it went off of it ſelf, without any manner of Application.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I attended the KING at <hi>St. Johnſtone</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of an <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele</hi> with <hi>Sarcomata</hi> of both Teſticles.</note> a Man of about forty years of age deſired my advice, he having been ſome years troubled with a Swelling <hi>in Scroto,</hi> which through length of time was grown ſo big, that he was not capable of following his affairs without much pain. It was ſoft, and ſeemed to make a double Tumour. I concluded it an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> diſtinctly lodged within ſome <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> or the proper Tunicles of the Teſticles, for I could feel neither of them. The <hi>Scrotum</hi> it ſelf was not concerned, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by its giving way to the Humours within. The Patient deſired to be cured: to which purpoſe I began my work on the right Teſticle, it being the moſt ſwelled. I applied a Cauſtick according to the length of the Part on the outſide, ſo as after the diſcharge of the Water the Opening might fall upon the ſide of the Teſticle, that, in caſe it ſhould be corrupted by the long lying of the Humour, I might the better apply Medicaments to it. The next day I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Eſcar, and gave vent to a quantity of Water, then to a rotten Matter, with ſome rags of corrupt Fleſh; and at laſt a bloudy <hi>Serum</hi> diſcharged; upon which this ſide ſunk, but the other remained full as before. I dreſſed it up with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> hot, and applied over all <hi>Empl. è bolo</hi> with Compreſs and Bag-truſs. The Patient was that night ſeized with a Colick, and reſted ill; and in the morning, finding him diſtempered with a Fever, I preſcribed him a carminative Clyſter, and ſome hours after let him bloud. That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, taking off the Dreſſings, I found the Eſcar dry, and the Parts about it ſwelled, and beginning to inflame. I fomented it with <hi>decoct. abſinth. flor.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95669:74"/>cham. ſambuci, roſ. rub.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in vino rubro,</hi> and applied <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> as before, and a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. hord. fabar.</hi> &amp;c. decocted in Oxymel over the diſeaſed Part. In the next Dreſſings I added <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> to the aforeſaid Unguent, and continued the uſe of the Fomentation and Cataplaſm. By theſe Applications the Ulcer tended to digeſtion, and the Eſcar ſeparated; but the Swelling conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued big. I then applied the Cataplaſm mentioned in the former Obſervation, doubling the quantity of <hi>cicuta,</hi> and dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>mundif. Paeracelſ. cum praecipitat.</hi> After a few days I obſerved in dreſſing of the Ulcer a rotten Slough to lie within, which I took hold of with my <hi>Forceps,</hi> and feeling it looſe pulled it out. It was the corrupt <hi>Cyſtis.</hi> Upon the coming away of which the Tumour ſunk. I dreſſed it up with Doſſills ſpred with the Mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative, and upon the Ulcer without applied <hi>unguent. diapompholygos,</hi> as alſo where the <hi>cicuta</hi> had bliſtered the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> From this dreſſing the Ulcer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted well. My endeavour was then to dry up the humidity, and contract that part of the <hi>Scrotum:</hi> which I did by adding <hi>flor. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ. ſumach,</hi> &amp;c. to the former Fomentation of red Wine, and by a Cataplaſm of <hi>far. hordei &amp; fabar.</hi> boiled up in ſome of the ſaid Fomentation. Whilſt I was healing the Ulcer within, a hard Swelling aroſe near the Production, and a <hi>Fungus</hi> thruſt out from that Part of the Teſticle. Upon ſearch I found that occaſioned the hard Swelling; whereupon I laid that part open by a Snip with a pair of Sciſſors, and covered the <hi>Fungus</hi> with Praecipitate and Doſſills of Lint; and by the uſe of that and the Vitriol-ſtone I conſumed it, and cured the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>After the Patient had a little recovered his ſtrength, I began with the other by Inciſion, making it about an inch in length, ſuppoſing it would ſooner digeſt, and thereby eſcape thoſe accidents. It diſcharged the like Matter as the other did. He ſuffered alſo Colick and Fever, till the corrupt <hi>Cyſtis</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted out, which was the ſpace of ten or twelve days. After which the Ulcer digeſted, and by the ſame method it healed, and the <hi>Scrotum</hi> contracted, ſo as it was not eaſy to judge that it had ever been diſeaſed. The Patient is yet alive, and hath never been diſturbed in thoſe Parts ſince.</p>
                     <p>A Citizen aged about forty ſix years laboured of ſuch an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> in both Teſticles.<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of the ſame.</note> I opened and treated them after the ſame method as in the former Obſervation hath been ſaid. He was ſubject to the ſame Accidents of Colick, Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After Digeſtion the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> caſt forth, as in ſuch like caſes is uſual, and by the bleſſing of God I cured him. Doctour <hi>du Molin</hi> ſaw him dreſt once or twice, and preſcribed him ſome cordial Julep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he thought fit.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Hydrocele's</hi> do not differ in the way of Cure, therefore I forbear a more particular diſcourſe or giving you more Inſtances of them; but wiſh you to conſider the Age and Habit of body before you begin this way of Cure; for they are generally ſubject to Colicks, Fevers, <hi>Singultus,</hi> &amp;c. and, if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat be weak, they are apt to gangrene.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HYdrocephalus</hi> is a watery Swelling of the Head,<note place="margin">Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus.</note> having the ſame Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with other Hydropical Tumours. It is moſt uſually the Diſeaſe of Children. The Part affected is (as I ſaid) the Head, either within or without the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it are an effuſion of the <hi>Serum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> either outwardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Cranium</hi> and the Scalp, or inwardly between it and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that happen on the outſide are too often the effect of ill handling by Midwifes and Nurſes, whereby the capillary Veſſells are bruiſed, and the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95669:75"/>ſerous part of the Bloud extravaſated. From this Bruiſing it is that Corruption often followeth, and the Humour is apt to ſtink.</p>
                     <p>The other more internal <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> affecting the Parts within, is an effuſion of <hi>Serum</hi> within the Scull, either between it and the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> or between that and the <hi>Pia mater.</hi> It is not leſs frequent to find this <hi>Serum</hi> ſo extravaſated to coagulate into a ſtiffe gelatinous ſubſtance all about the Veſſells under the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Brain, and thence to involve all the Roots and the <hi>Caudex</hi> of the Spinall marrow, quite over the <hi>Nates</hi> and <hi>Teſtes</hi> and <hi>Glandula pinealis,</hi> reaching into the Ventricles of the Brain. Many inſtances of this kind I could give you in Ricket children: but theſe things are not to be diſcovered till the Patient be dead.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are ſuitable to the Part affected,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and the quality of the Humour. If it lie immediately under the hairie Scalp, and poſſeſs it, all the whole Head muſt be ſwelled. If the Matter within be oedematous, it will pit under your finger: if it be a pure <hi>Serum,</hi> it will return to its ſeat when your finger is taken off. The Face is pale and ſwelled, ſo alſo are the Eye-lids, ſometimes bloudy and ſhining. In the increaſe of it, it ſometimes thruſts out a Tumour like a Wen, but the Fluctuation of it ſheweth it to be Water. If it be between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Pericranium,</hi> you may feel the <hi>Cranium</hi> bare, and a Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between it and the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> If it lie between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Dura mater,</hi> the Sutures are looſe, ſo that you may often bury your finger between them. When it lieth under the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> it maketh that ſwell, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thruſts it ſelf through between ſome of the Sutures of the Scull; as particularly it did in a young Child, of which anon. What is within the Ventricles of the Brain is not eaſily diſcovered whilſt the Patient is alive; onely it may be gueſſed at by great Stupidity and Inſenſibility, if any ſuch thing be.</p>
                     <p>Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> did tell me of one that in <hi>Bedlam</hi> was obſerved to ſit upright with his back to a wall without ſpeaking or opening his Eyes for many months, onely ſome odd mimicall geſtures he uſed. Upon his death he was opened by order of Doctour <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> Phyſician of the place. An oedematous Tumour was found to occupy all the upper part of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum</hi> between it and the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> which deſcending by the poſteriour parts of it did poſſeſs the entrance into the two Ventricles, the <hi>Glandula pinealis</hi> it ſelf being turned into a Bladder of water.</p>
                     <p>But the Story cited out of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſalius</hi> by <hi>Sennertus</hi> is yet more wonderfull, of a young Girl, that kept her Senſes well enough, yet her Head ſwelled ſo great as to hold nine pints of Water. The like Obſervations we find in <hi>Hildanus, Kerkringius,</hi> and others, where the Brain hath been ſo little, and ſo oddly placed, that the whole hath been judged to be Water. By which we may judge that Stupidity, though, when we find it, it may give us cauſe of ſuſpicion that ſuch a Tumour is there lodged, yet it is not the neceſſary concomitant of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Children labouring of this Diſeaſe are for the moſt part very unhealthfull,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and in their infancy ſubject to Convulſions. If they ſcape that, they fall into <hi>Rachitis,</hi> which for the moſt part terminateth in the <hi>King's Evill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe that thruſt out from within the Scull are deadly. Thoſe next the <hi>Cranium</hi> are not without great danger. If the Tumour be large, and poſſeſs all the Head, the Cure is not without difficulty: but if it poſſeſſs onely ſome particular externall Part, it is more eaſy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of this Diſeaſe is much the ſame with that which hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the generall Diſcourſe of Watery Tumours,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> by powerfull diſcutient and drying Medicaments; as <hi>ſummitat. thymi, abſinth. majoranae, fol. beton. ſalviae,

In order to the applying of theſe the Hair ought to be ſhaved. Fontanells are alſo of uſe in the Neck and behind the Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Humour doth not diſcuſs by the aforementioned Remedies, you may let the Water out by ſmall Apertions, that it may as it were inſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; and the while continue the uſe of the milder Diſcutients and Exſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, to reſtore the Scalp to its natural tone. But if, through length of time, the Humour hath united it ſelf into a Tumour of ſome particular Part, if you be ſatisfied that it doth not ariſe from within the Scull, you may cut into it, and let out the Water; or, if it hath a ſmall <hi>baſis,</hi> make a Ligature on it, and cut it off. But if you ſuppoſe it ariſeth from within the Scull, forbear the extirpating it.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about four years of age was brought to me,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus.</hi>
                        </note> ſuppoſed to have the <hi>King's Evill.</hi> The Head was extraordinary big, the Face full and pale, the Eye-brows and Eye-lids ſwelled. I laid my hand upon the Head, and, feeling it ſoft, I adviſed them to purge the Child with <hi>reſina jalapii</hi> or <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gridium</hi> and <hi>Calomel.</hi> in the form of a <hi>bolus, cum ſyr. de ſpina cervina,</hi> and to make Fontanells in the Neck and behind the Ears, and afterward, if there were occaſion, to ſhave the Head, applying ſuch Medicaments as have been ſet down in the method of Cure. Sometime after the Parents told me the Child was cured onely by the Fontanells behind the Ears.</p>
                     <p>In a Child of half a year old,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus.</hi>
                        </note> labouring under a watery Swelling of the upper part of the Head between the hairy Scalp and <hi>Pericranium,</hi> I made Iſſues behind the Ears and in the Neck, and fomented the Head with a Decoction of the milder Diſcutients and Exſiccants boiled in red Wine. But, it being cold weather, they rather deſired an Emplaſter. In compliance with their deſires a cephalick Emplaſter was applied. After ſome time it made ſuch an itching and ſoarneſs, as put us upon the neceſſity of taking it off; which was not done without difficulty, the Scalp being much excoriated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath. We fomented it again as aboveſaid, and applied Colewort-leaves on the Parts affected. It healed up in few days, and the Diſeaſe was not much leſſened: the Iſſues behind the Ears alſo healed as the Eſcars caſt off. Having applied ſeveral Medicaments unſucceſsfully, I made two or three Punctures into the Scalp, and let the Water out; then applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. fabar. flor. roſ. rub. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ. bacc. myrtill. &amp; ſummit. hyſſop. pulver.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in red Wine. By the uſe of this and the foreſaid Fomentation the Child was cured.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus.</hi>
                        </note> having a large Tumour on the <hi>Os lambdoides</hi> bigger then a Gooſe-egge, was commended to me by Sir <hi>Fra. Pr.</hi> I ſhaved the Hair from about it, brought the <hi>baſis</hi> in by a Ligature, and cut it off; then made a croſs Stitch, taking up the Arterie with the ſame Stitch, and brought the Lips as cloſe as conveniently I could; then dreſſed up the Wound with <hi>pulv. Galeni cum albumine ovi,</hi> and applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over all, with Compreſs and Bandage. The Humour was a crude <hi>Serum,</hi> as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95669:76"/>in <hi>Hydrocele;</hi> onely in the bottom of it there were dregs that ſeemed to be a melicereous Matter. The third day after, finding the Wound tending to digeſtion, I dreſſed it with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinthina:</hi> after Digeſtion I cut the Stitches, and incarned and cicatrized it in few days by the uſual Medicaments ſet down in Wounds of the Head. Many as big I have taken off the ſame way, and cured accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince I was fetched to a little Infant not ten days old that was born with two of the above-mentioned Tumours.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of <hi>Hydroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus.</hi>
                        </note> They were of the ſhape of Cupping-glaſſes of the middle ſize, ſeated upon the <hi>Suturae lambdoïdes</hi> and <hi>ſagittalis:</hi> they had their Originall within the Scull. I felt the Holes they thruſt out at; each Hole was round, I ſuppoſe of the compaſs of an Half-crown, and, as I afterwards found, had their <hi>Cyſtis</hi> from the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> The Infant ſeemed to be dying when I came; it died that night. The next day I ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and found it as I have ſaid. There was alſo great quantity of Water floating within the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and in the Ventricles of the Brain, and a gelatinous ſubſtance all about the Veſſells on the upper part, as alſo under the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I have before related.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of Scabs and Itch.</head>
                     <p>AFter Wateriſh Tumours I find Authours frequently treating of the <hi>Scab</hi> or <hi>Itch;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> a Diſeaſe which ſeems to have its Originall either from abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vicious Salt in the Bloud, or poſſibly from a locall Ferment in the Skin.</p>
                     <p>A Scab catched by Infection ſeems pretty manifeſtly to own its Origine to a locall Ferment, there being no other fault in the Body then what lieth in the Skin it ſelf, and converteth the nutritious Juices thither conveyed into the Diſeaſe here mentioned. And its probable that moſt other Itches do begin in the ſame place, there being in the Skin a vicious Ferment which makes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction accordingly, and conſequently cauſeth all the other Degenerations that happen. Theſe Degenerations do increaſe to a farther infection, if the Bloud abound with a ſalt <hi>Serum;</hi> in which caſe the Fermentation becometh exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, the Diſeaſe groweth more vigorous, ſpreads farther inward, and infects the whole maſſe.</p>
                     <p>This way, I ſay, the Itch is very often generated, preſſing from without inward: nay, I believe that moſt commonly it ſo happens. But I do not deny that it may likewiſe riſe from within, as ſome of the greater ſorts of Scabs certainly do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> may be taken from the Cauſe,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> and accordingly as it affects the whole Body, or ſome particular Part, as the Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe needs not much deſcription; it's known by its naſtineſs and trouble, and upon that account is more important then it would otherwiſe be thought.</p>
                     <p>The Scab or Itch is not eſteemed dangerous to Life when it proceedeth from an outward Infection.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> But if it owe its Original to an inward indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Bloud, it may prove dangerous; either when it is accidentally ſtopped by externall Applications and cauſes, upon which occaſion Fevers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95669:76"/>Epilepſies, Conſumptions, and many other like Accidents, have ariſen: nay, when the Scab hath not been hindred in its untoward progreſs, the Bloud hath nowithſtanding been wholly corrupted, and the Patient brought to the grave. Another miſchief it hath, <hi>viz.</hi> Infection, eſpecially if the Scab be moiſt and full of ſubtil Humours. Upon all theſe accounts, both of the Turpitude, Danger, and Infection, it is convenient to propound a Cure.</p>
                     <p>Whether this Diſeaſe ariſe from an outward Infection,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> or inward indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bloud, the Cure is much one; onely this latter requireth more your conſideration, to take the indication from the Cauſe, and to make Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accordingly before you apply your externall Remedies.</p>

                     <p>Where the Diſeaſe hath overſpred the whole Body, there (as I have ſaid) Bathing is neceſſary; and if the ſeaſon of the year be proper, the River of <hi>Thames</hi> or other Rivers may ſerve: but in the colder ſeaſons Bathing in warm water is effectuall, the party ſitting the while on a Bag of Wheat-bran. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality may have ſweet Powders, as thoſe of <hi>lign. caſſia, Rhodium, calamus aromaticus,</hi> &amp;c. If the Diſeaſe require it, they may have ſuch Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients boiled in the Bath as have been preſcribed in the Fomentation above: they may alſo have a mixture <hi>cinerum ſarment. fraxini, alum. rup. ſulphur. viv.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cap. pulverizatorum an. p. aeq.</hi> It may be quilted in bags, or made into balls with Wheat-bran and Soap, with which they may rub their diſeaſed Bodies.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the late Civill Wars our Souldiers in the Weſtern parts of the Kingdome were much annoied with this Diſeaſe, which being gotten amongſt them, they infected one another. I commonly let them bloud which fell under my care, and adviſed them to drink for their Mornings draughts Brimſtone and Milk, and to anoint themſelves with Brimſtone and Butter. But in warm weather frequent bathing in the Rivers was their Cure.</p>
                     <p>CHange of Diet and manner of living is frequently the cauſe of the Itch.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> So a Youth of about ſeventeen years of age, newly entertained into a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſervice, raiſed from a ſlender mean Diet to a more plentifull fare, brake out with Itch and Scabs all over his Body. Severall Ointments were applied, and after all a Quick-ſilver-Girdle was put on him: but the Diſeaſe enraged, and under the Girdle the Skin was heated and excoriated much. I cauſed the Girdle to be thrown off, and adviſed the raw Parts to be dreſſed with a mixture of <hi>unguent. nutrit.</hi> and <hi>populeon;</hi> then cauſed him to be let bloud, and purged with a Decoction of <hi>radic. lapath. ſena, ſem. carthami,</hi> &amp;c. and directed him to bath in warm water for ſome few days: by which he was cured. Such like Youths ſo diſeaſed, in the hotter ſeaſons, after Purging and Bleeding, I have commended to bathing in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and thereby cured them.</p>
                     <p>A Girl of about twelve years of age was infected by her Play-fellows at School in the Country,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> and brake out in mattery Scabs and Itch all over her Body, inſomuch as her Shift was frequently bloudy with ſcratching her ſelf. I let her bloud alſo, purged her often with Infuſions of Sena, Rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to contemperate the Humours by <hi>calomel.</hi> and <hi>aethiops mineralis,</hi> but without ſucceſs, it itching ſo intolerably, that, doe what we could, ſhe would rub and ſcratch, ſo as it no ſooner healed in one place, but it brake out in the ſame or in another. So difficult a work it is to extinguiſh this Diſeaſe where it hath been of any long continuance. The weather growing warmer, ſhe bathed in warm water, rubbed her Body with ſome of the above-mentioned Bags the firſt three or four Bathings, and in about three weeks ſpace was freed of her Itch, and perfectly cured thereby. The Scars and diſcolouring of her Skin on her Hands and Arms were removed by anointing them with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>ſacch. Saturni</hi> with <hi>unguent. roſac.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about thirty ſix years of age was infected with the Itch all over his Body.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> I let him bloud and purged him, as hath been ſet down in the method of Cure; and, having ſo evacuated the <hi>Plethora,</hi> I preſcribed him the taking of <hi>aethiops mineralis,</hi> and ſent him ſome <hi>unguent. popul.</hi> &amp;c. and cured him. By the ſame means I have cured ſome others ſince.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about fifty years of age was very much diſturbed by an Itch.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> After the taking divers Medicaments unſucceſsfully ſhe ſent to me. I
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95669:77"/>made her ſome Pills of <hi>aethiops mineralis,</hi> which ſhe took morning and evening, without any obſervance of keeping her houſe; by which ſhe was cured in eight or ten days, and hath not been troubled with it ſince, as ſhe her ſelf told me three years after, which was laſt Summer.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about forty years old,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> of a melancholick and ſcorbutical Habit of body, was ſorely afflicted with the Itch all over her Body. Her Phyſician at the ſame time being indiſpoſed could not viſit her, but, according to the relation her Servants gave him of her Diſeaſe, preſcribed her Clyſters, and purged her with ſuch opening Apozemes as were proper in her caſe, adviſing bloud to be drawn from the Haemorrhoidall Veins by Leeches, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards preſcribed her a Bath, in which ſhe bathed often, but without ſucceſs. Upon which conſideration I was deſired by the Phyſician to give her a viſit, to inform him of her condition. I did ſo, and ſaw her Hands, Arms and Breaſt overſpred with brawny Scales, under which were mattery Wheals. She was very hot, and her Tongue parch'd; her Pulſe ſeemed to be oppreſſed. I told her ſhe had a Fever. She replied, it was for want of ſleep occaſioned by the intolerable Itch and ſoarneſs. I gave an account of her condition to the Phyſician, who thereupon preſcribed her to be let bloud about eight or nine ounces, and that night after a Clyſter and a cordiall Julep; by which ſhe was relieved. About three or four days after ſhe complained of a pain on her left Side, and had a Fever, with great heat and thirſt. The Phyſician preſcribed more bloud to be taken away; which was done to the quantity of nine ounces or thereabouts, by which ſhe was relieved of her pain and Fever, and daily recovered ſtrength. And upon farther information of her Recovery, her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician adviſed her to remove to <hi>Epſom,</hi> and there to drink the Waters. She did ſo, and by his Preſcriptions was alſo cured there of her Itch.</p>
                     <p>A Girl of about four years of age was brought to me in a poor woman's arms in the very midſt of Winter, the ground being covered with ſnow.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> She was broken out all over the Body with an Itch and mattery Scabs. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſired my Opinion of it, whether I could cure it. I told her the Cure was difficult; but when the weather ſhould be more ſeaſonable I would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertake it. The following Spring I was fetched to this Child, ſaw the Body ſo diſeaſed as I before repreſented it, and was perſwaded to undertake the Cure. I, conſidering that they were but few things I could give ſuch a Child, and thoſe required to be well taſted, therefore began with a ſmall Ale medicated with <hi>ſarſaparilla, lign. lentiſc. China,</hi> and ſome of the Herbs and Roots propoſed in the method of Cure for ſuch Drinks. In ſome of this Ale I mixed a purging Syrupe, by which the Child was frequently purged: then I gave her <hi>Merc. dulc. in conſ. roſ. damaſc.</hi> once in three days, and continued medicated Ale for her ordinary drink, with which they alſo ſometimes made a Poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink. By this method the Itch leſſened, and the Scabs dried: but by the proſecution of it the Child's Chaps became ſomewhat ſoar. I cured the Child and finiſhed my courſe by bathing it in Milk and Water, and ſome few Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretcks. The Parents were well pleaſed with the Cure: but afterwards conſulting a Phyſician (ſince deceaſed) in ſome caſe concerning their own healths, and diſcourſing of the Child's Cure, he perſwaded them I had effected it with Mercury, and put them upon ſuch a prejudice to the Medicament, as they from that declined the adviſing with me, ſuſpecting I might again repeat the uſe of it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>Of</hi> Lepra, <hi>or</hi> Elephantiaſis.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>LEpra</hi> and <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> have ſo many acceptions in Writers,<note place="margin">Deſcription, and Differences.</note> that it is fit to diſtinguiſh them in the firſt place. I ſhall therefore underſtand by <hi>Lepra</hi> the higheſt degree of the Itch, where the Scabs grow dry, and break out in the form of white Scales, ſticking hard to one another, not eaſily to be pulled off; but if they are, they leave the place red, and ſoon return again. The <hi>Leproſy</hi> of the <hi>Arabians</hi> was a quite other Diſeaſe, which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantiaſis,</hi> and is nothing elſe but an univerſall Cancer of the whole Body, black, and indeed a moſt miſerable Diſeaſe, but I think ſcarce known in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo have an <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> differing from that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Varix,</hi> of which Authors may be conſulted.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſe I purpoſe to give you an Inſtance of is the <hi>Lepra Graecorum,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be <hi>Celſus</hi> his <hi>Impetigo,</hi> and by others <hi>Pſora,</hi> the white Scurf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a vicious Salt in the Bloud, that doth diminiſh the <hi>Serum</hi> of it, which when the Skin ſhould ſeparate by a juſt Tranſpiration, in ſtead thereof it converts it into a dry, ſalt, itching, white Scab, very troubleſome to the Patient, and difficult of Cure.</p>
                     <p>The immediate <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Diſeaſe is,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> as I have ſaid, a vicious Salt in the <hi>Serum.</hi> Authours will have it to be generated of a mixture of <hi>Atra bilis,</hi> to be of a more groſs matter, and to ariſe from evill Diet, a dry <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Skin, a Suppreſſion of the Haemorrhoids or <hi>Menſes,</hi> alſo from a Quartan Fever; and to proceed by the way of Infection, as Scabs do, it being an exceſs thereof.</p>
                     <p>It is known by the Deſcription I have given of it,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and from thence a Judgement may be given of the difficulty and contumaciouſneſs of Cure. If ſalt Humours abound very much in the body, it proves often incurable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of this Diſeaſe conſiſts in the proſecution of the ſame method with that of the Scab;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> onely this, as it exceeds that, requires to be treated more ſtrictly, and with Medicaments more powerfull. I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with the particularizing them, but refer you to the Obſervation following.</p>
                     <p>A Young Woman about 20 years of age had been long afflicted with a Species of an <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> upon her left Brow.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſis.</hi>
                        </note> Many endeavours had been uſed by Preſcriptions internall and externall, <hi>viz.</hi> frequent Venaeſections, application of Leeches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Diſeaſe increaſing, I was conſulted, and adviſed her to purge once in four days with <hi>Merc. dulc.</hi> and <hi>diagrid.</hi> and the intermitting days to take <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> and to drink for her ordinary drink <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lign. lentiſcin.</hi> with ſome of the alterative Plants preſcribed in the method of Cure. The Part affected we fomented daily with the <hi>Fotus</hi> propoſed in the method of Cure: and after the Scabs and Scurf were removed, it was anointed with ſome of that Unguent of <hi>Vigo's</hi> preſcribed in the Cure of <hi>Herpes miliaris.</hi> I began this Cure in Winter, preſently after <hi>Chriſtmaſſe,</hi> and cured her before the Spring; yet adviſed the continuance of the internalls, purging her weekly,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95669:78"/>and when the weather ſhould grow ſeaſonable, bathing in freſh water tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm. I ſaw her half a year after perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of about thirty years of age,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſis.</hi>
                        </note> having been a long time diſeaſed with an <hi>Impetigo,</hi> or Species of <hi>Elephantiaſis Graecorum,</hi> in her Arms, Thighs and Legs, came commended to my care. It began with a <hi>Serpigo,</hi> making many round ſpots, ſuch as are generally called <hi>Ring-worms,</hi> with extream itching, which by frequent ſcratching heated and mattered, and afterwards ſcabb'd, and in progreſs overſpred her Lims with a dry white Scurf, under which the ſerpiginous circles lay covered. She had paſſed through the milder Remedies frequently without ſucceſs: upon which account I deſigned Mercurialls; and beginning with Venaeſection, afterwards purged her with <hi>decoct. epithymi,</hi> as it is preſcribed in the method of Cure. After the ſecond Doſe I gave her twenty grains of <hi>Calomel.</hi> over night, and purged it off in the morning with the ſaid Apozeme: during which I cauſed her Lims to be bathed and rubbed often with the Decoction to that purpoſe preſcribed in the method of Cure, by which the Scurf was moiſtned and brought off; then it was anointed with one of the foreſaid Unguents. After I had thus evacuated the <hi>Plethora,</hi> and diſpoſed her body for Mercurialls more operative, I gave her each morning and evening a few grains of <hi>Mercur. diaphoret.</hi> in a <hi>bolus</hi> with <hi>conſ. lujulae</hi> and Mithridate, diſpoſing her thereby to a breathing ſweat, and cauſed her Lims to be daily anointed with <hi>unguent. enulat. cum Mercurio.</hi> Theſe Medicaments proving unſucceſsfull, and her Chaps not growing ſoar, I cauſed her Lims to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> his Unction preſcribed in <hi>Lues venerea,</hi> and vomited her once in four or five days with <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> By this courſe ſhe emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and her Skin became clean of the <hi>Impetigo,</hi> &amp;c. but ſhe did not ſalivate, nor indeed were her Chaps very ſoar. I concluded her courſe of Phyſick with Bathing, and Sweating with Diaphoreticks, purging her between whiles, for the ſpace of a fortnight, and diſmiſſed her, with advice to drink a Decoction of <hi>rad. lapath. ſummit. fumariae dulc. amarae,</hi> &amp;c. About two months after ſhe ſhewed her ſelf to me cured and well complexioned, and is well at the Printing of this.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of about fourteen years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> of a ſallow Complexion and lean dry Body, having been diſeaſed from her infancy with a white dry Scab from the crown of her Head to her Feet, her Skin of a Mooriſh tann'd colour, after taking divers Remedies without ſucceſs, was at laſt put into my hands for Cure. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her with a draught of the <hi>Decoctum epithymi,</hi> and the day after let her bloud about eight ounces or more. She bare it well, and the bloud was of good colour and conſiſtence. The day after I purged her with ſome of the ſame Decoction, with the addition of <hi>ſyr. de pomis purg.</hi> and in the while cauſed a medicated Ale to be made according to the preſcription hath been ſet down in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapter of the method of Cure, which was her ordinary Drink, and ſerved to make Poſſets thoſe days ſhe purged. Then I prepared a Bath wherein had been boiled <hi>fol. &amp; radic. althaeae, lapath. enulae camp. bryoniae, fol. ſcabioſae, majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranae, fumariae, ſaponariae, bacc. laur. juniper. ſem. ſtaphiſagriae, ſem. ſinapis, alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſulph. vitriol. Hungaric.</hi> and a Bag of Wheat-bran to ſit upon. I preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her likewiſe the Mixture afore mentioned made into a Ball, with common Soap, for her to rub her ſelf with while ſhe ſate in the Bath. She had alſo a Pearl-Julep ready to take upon occaſion. After ſhe had thus bathed according to her ſtrength half or three quarters of an hour, ſhe was lapt in a warm Sheet, put into bed, and took a morſell of a cordiall <hi>bolus ex theriaca, conſ. borrag. lujulae, Bezoard. occident. ocul. caner. troch. de viper.</hi> made up <hi>cum ſyr. è cort. citr. &amp; pom. alterant.</hi> Upon which ſhe ſwet an hour or more, then dried, and anointed with one of the fore-mentioned Unguents. A waſt-coat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was put on,

I continued this method of Bathing ſome while, and purged her every third day with <hi>calomel.</hi> ℈j. at night, and a draught of <hi>decoct. epithymi</hi> next morning. Her Head was full of white dry Scabs; for which reaſon her Hair was clipt cloſe off, and her Head bathed with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein had been boiled ſome of the ſame materialls which were preſcribed for the Bath, and then anointed with burnt Butter <hi>cum fuligine &amp; ſale, an. p. aequ.</hi> In the time of Bathing I cauſed her Head to be rubbed with common Soap, and bathed, to looſen the Scurf and dry Scales. Sometime during her Bathing I rubbed ſome of the largeſt Scales and ſuch as ſtuck firmeſt with a Cauſtick-ſtone, which did not onely haſten their fall off, but ſcoured the Skin notably well. Where the bigger Scabs ſeparated, there remained for the moſt part an ugly diſcolouring of the place, and little Excreſcences of fleſh, by which thoſe Scabs had been held on ſo cloſe as if they had been thereby nailed faſt. Theſe Excreſcences I rubbed off with the Cauſtick-ſtone, and where there was occaſion I dreſſed the Parts with <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> or <hi>lithargyr.</hi> yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Diſeaſe roſe in one part as it dried in others. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I vomited her with a few grains of <hi>turbith mineral.</hi> and repeating it twice or thrice, intermitting a day or two between, her Chaps ſwelled. Upon which I forbore the uſe of the Bath, and kept her warm, then ſalivated her ſeventeen or eighteen days: in which time the Scurf fell off quite, and her Skin became clean. I then purged her with Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> his <hi>Potus amarus,</hi> and put her into a <hi>decoct, ſarſae, Chinae,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome of the hepatick Plants; I ſwet her for ſome days with Diaphoreticks, purging her once in three or four days; then bathed her in warm water, waſhing her Body with Balls of Wheat-bran and Soap for ſome few days. Thus we concluded the courſe, ſhe being to all appearance perfectly well, and her Complexion freſh. She ſhould then have returned into the Country, but that I deſired ſhe might ſtay the Spring of the year for a farther triall of her Cure, it being then <hi>February.</hi> She did ſtay, and in <hi>April</hi> the Diſeaſe began to appear in her right Arm, and riſe ſcattering about her Body; which encreaſing, I let her bloud again, purged her with Whey and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and bathed her in warm water, wherein I put a Solution of Sublimate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning that way to flux her. But it not riſing to my mind, I anointed her Legs and Arms with Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> his <hi>unguent. Neapolit.</hi> by which I ſalivated her near thirty days; in which time the Scabs fell off again. As the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declined, I put her into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> as formerly, ſwet her and purged her, and, having finiſht the courſe with Bathing as I had done before, delivered her once more cured. Her Friends, ſeeing her thus recovered, put her to School, to give her that Breeding which her diſeaſed Body had hindered her ſo long from. Since that ſhe is married, and, as I have been lately informed, continues well: yet is not ſo freed of that Diſeaſe, but that ſhe hath ſometimes little Remarques of it.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of</hi> Gutta Roſacea.</head>
                     <p>THe Face is alſo ſubject to theſe irkſome Diſeaſes, which have been ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Impetigo</hi> or <hi>Lichen, Mentagra,</hi> and <hi>Gutta Roſacea.</hi> The former of which raged in <hi>Italy,</hi> and was taken notice of by <hi>Pliny</hi> in his days as a malign Diſeaſe; but it is not known in our times, unleſs it be in the <hi>Lues venerea,</hi> where are ſometimes found all the Species of <hi>Impetigo</hi> and <hi>Puſtulae</hi> that ever were mentioned by any of the Ancients. But in this place I ſhall onely take notice of the <hi>Gutta Roſacea,</hi> a Diſeaſe which, when heightened by acrimony, is not inferiour to the moſt malicious of other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and as difficult of Cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gutta Roſacea</hi> ariſeth in little hard Tubercles like ſo many <hi>Hordeola,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> 
                        <hi>affecting</hi> the Brows and Face all over with great itching, which being ſcratcht look red, and riſe in great Welks, rendring the Viſage fiery, and in progreſs of time make thoſe toting <hi>Copper-noſes,</hi> as we generally expreſs them.</p>
                     <p>The immediate <hi>Cauſe</hi> is groſs hot Bloud affecting the Face with ſuch a fluſhing heat as is commonly ſeen in Bluſhing,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and by reaſon of its groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence can neither return back, nor ſuddenly diſcuſs, but remaineth in the Part, and after ſome time riſeth in red Pimples, which ſo vitiate the tone of the Fibres, that though the Patient do get afterwards a better Habit of body, yet doth he for the moſt part ſuffer under the Diſeaſe. Ill Diet is a Cauſe, hot Spices, Onions, Garlick, and the like; ſo are ſtrong Wines: yet it's thought more commonly to befall thoſe that drink ſtrong Beer. A ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Menſes</hi> or Haemorrhoids is often a Cauſe of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of the Diſeaſe are, a fluſhing heat, with red Pimples and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> which in progreſs of time become blewiſh, and of a more dark red colour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gutta Roſacea</hi> is difficult of Cure in its recency: and if it be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> the Tubercles grow big, and Excreſcences ariſe out of them, and they accompany the Patients to their graves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> is begun with regulation of Diet,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> removing of the Obſtructions in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and contemperating of the evill quality of the Bloud. The Diet ought to be of good nouriſhment and of eaſy digeſtion, as hath been above ſaid.

                     </p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about forty years old was very much vexed with a fluſhing heat all over his Face,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> with ſome red Pimples not conſiderable. Many Medicaments he applied, but in progreſs of time they terminated in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles, ſome whereof were round, others of an ovall figure; ſome were hard, others ſoft. They all itcht extreamly, and put him upon a pinching of them, upon which they grew the bigger. One of them he opened with a Pen-knife, and gave vent to a viſcous white Matter, but the Tubercle fill'd again. Upon which conſideration he adviſed with me, and deſired my help. I cauſed a Fomentation to be made of ſome of the Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents above mentioned, and to the <hi>Faeces</hi> beaten and pulped I added <hi>axung. gallin. anatis, ol. ex ped. bovinis,</hi> and with a little <hi>terebinthina</hi> and Wax made a Cerote, which after the uſe of the Fomentation was daily applied. In the while he was purged, as hath been above propoſed, and let bloud, and after wards drunk <hi>Epſom</hi> Waters. By this method much of the Matter was eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, the heat contemperated, and the Tubercles in part breathed forth. Thoſe that ſuppurated I opened, and diſcharged the Matter: and thoſe that would neither ſuppurate nor diſcuſs, I cut into, and permitted them to bleed. By the continuance of Emollients they reſolved, and in the ſpace of ſix weeks he was in a manner freed of theſe Hillocks, and his Countenance became ſmooth and clear.</p>
                     <p>Some others I have cured by the ſame method, and of the female Sex, where it was more diſcernable. I ſhall forbear the inſtancing them, becauſe it was a work of time, and performed after the ſame method.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of Flatuous Tumours.</head>
                     <p>WE have already treated of Tumours coming from <hi>Humours,</hi> which was our firſt generall Head: we ſhall now ſay ſomewhat of thoſe that owe their Origine to <hi>Wind,</hi> called by the <hi>Latins Inflationes,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks Emphyſemata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are by Authors uſually ranked next to <hi>Oedema,</hi> as partaking much of the nature of thoſe Tumours, having generally a watery Phlegm joined with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Emphyſema</hi> is a light puffy Tumour eaſily yielding to the preſſure of your fingers, and ariſeth again in the inſtant you take them off.<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> It is of an uncertain bigneſs, ſome times very large, other times ſmall, without any weight to the Part that contains it.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Differences,</hi> they are either pure, or mixed.<note place="margin">Differences.</note> A pure <hi>Emphyſema</hi> is found rarely, unleſs it be in caſes of Wounds in the Breaſt, where the air get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in between the Muſcles and Membranes doth puff them up like to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a Shoulder of veal. Moſt uſually they are mixed with Humour, which is always Phlegmatick. They differ alſo as to their place, ſome being inward, others outward. The inward belong to the Phyſicians. Outwardly we find them upon the Ey-lids, on the great Joints, and in other membranaceous Parts. The Belly is very ſubject to them, both in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and Navell, which are the uſuall ſeats of the <hi>Hernia ventoſa;</hi> and indeed in other parts of it whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is relaxed. In which places we do firſt find a ſoft windy Tumour, and at length, if it be not prevented, an Extu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of the Gut it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the pure <hi>Emphyſema</hi> is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> the ingreſs of air.<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> But that of the mixed ones is not ſo be aſſigned. And poſſibly he that reads what the learnedeſt Authours have ſaid on this Subject will depart unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                     <p>In the inward Parts, as in the Ventricle and Guts, we find manifeſt acidities, which meeting ſome fermentaceous Matter do huff and puff, and, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the bounds of theſe Cavities do blow them up into a Tumour, which is uſually diſſolved by Evacuation upward and downward; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding doth not prevent the ſucceſſions of new Inflations, unleſs the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting principle be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>In the outward Parts, as the Knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we do imagine ſome proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degeneration of the local Ferment, which doth make the like Ebullition with the extravaſated Humour. The Vapour ſo generated being confined within the Skin, ſo as not to be ſuffered to paſs out, remains there in a windy or flatuous Swelling.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Tumours are without alteration of colour in the Skin, or pain,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> unleſs they ly deep amongſt the ſenſible Parts near the <hi>Perioſteum.</hi> One <hi>Sign</hi> is given us of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſudden increaſe and diminution. The Ancients diſtinguiſh an <hi>Emphyſema</hi> from other Tumours by the Sound it giveth when ſtruck upon. But that Sign I have not met with, no not in the <hi>Tympanites.</hi> Indeed a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95669:81"/>crackling is often felt, if the Tumour be in the Knee or other outward Part; and in the Belly Wind is heard to rumble: but what concerneth inward Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is not within compaſs of my diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Flatuous Tumours affecting the great Joints are of moſt difficult Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and not to be opened without mature conſideration. All Tumours of this nature are more eaſily cured in Summer then Winter. But thoſe off from the Joints may be opened at any time, and are of eaſy Cure.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of thoſe Tumours you may proceed by internalls, as hath been ſhewed in <hi>Oedema,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> the Cauſes differing but little, both being from a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick conſtitution of the Bloud. Phlebotomy may be admitted, if Bloud; but generally the Pituitous Humours are here in fault, and they are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and purged as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>The externall Applications ought to be ſuch as may by their heating and attenuating quality diſcuſs the Flatulencies. Such are <hi>ſummitates majoranae, abrotoni, hyſſopi, origani, rutae, roriſmarin. bacc. lauri, juniperi, ſem. aniſi. foeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi, carui, cymini,</hi> &amp;c.

If by none of theſe it yield to Diſcuſſion, but inflame and grow painfull, treat it with Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes; of which <hi>cerat. oeſypi</hi> and <hi>lana ſuccida</hi> hath the preeminence. But if the Tumour be in ſuch place where it may be ſafely opened, the ſpeedieſt way of Cure is by cutting into it. Some Writers have adviſed the binding of the Part above and below, and opening the Tumour between. If you think there be reaſon for it, doe ſo; but there is no fear of its flying away from the vent you ſhall give it. The Cure of the Abſceſſe is afterwards effected as in other crude Abſceſſes hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>In penetrating Wounds of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and where the externall Orifice is ſmall, there flatulent Tumours may be frequently ſeen greatly blowing up that and the adjacent Parts. The Cure is performed by inlarging the externall Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Skin. You may ſee an Obſervation of it amongſt thoſe of the Breaſt in the Treatiſe of <hi>Wounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the many that have come to me ſuppoſed to have the <hi>King's Evill,</hi> there were not a few diſeaſed with crude Tumours of other kinds. Some of thoſe which ſeemed moſt like Flatulent Tumours I opened, but they proved all to be phlegmatick and wateriſh Tumours. Thoſe in the very Knees which are ſo generally eſteemed flatulent, I opened by puncture with a Lancet, ſome to the very Bone: in the moſt prominent parts there iſſued forth onely a few drops of ſerous bloud, and that without any diminution of the Swelling. In ſome of thoſe in which I made the Puncture leſs deep I paſſed in a Probe, where feeling a Tumour under the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> I penetrated it with my Lancet, and diſcharged an <hi>Ichor</hi> in ſmall quantity: the Bone was there carious. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am apt to think that all theſe painfull Swellings in the Knees (which are not ſtrumous) do ariſe from an over-moiſture of the Membranes and Ligaments, which in progreſs of time doth corrupt the Bone underneath, ſo that they apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and terminate in carious Ulcers. Thoſe which are leſs painfull are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuperficiall, proceeding, as I ſuppoſe, from an over-moiſture of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana carnoſa</hi> and Parts above it. It being ſo, our beſt endeavours ought to be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95669:81"/>in the applying moderate attenuating and exſiccant Remedies with good Bandage.</p>
                     <p>A Young Gentleman of about eighteen years of age was commended to my care by Doctour <hi>Denton.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> He had a round ſoft Tumour upon the fore-part of his right Thigh, without Inflammation or Pulſation. I applied a Cauſtick upon it, and the next day divided the Eſcar: there came nothing of Matter forth. I thruſt my Knife deeper into it: there followed onely a few drops of bloud, but the Tumour ſunk. I dreſt up the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> to digeſt off the Slough. During the ſeparation of it there appeared no more Matter then might reaſonably be expected from ſuch an Eſcar. After ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof the Ulcer incarned and cicatrized in few days. This we judged a flatulent Tumour, yet it was not diſcovered by its Noiſe or Sound.</p>
                     <p>A Citizen's wife aged about thirty ſix years, of an ill Habit of body, had,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tumour on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Thigh near the Knee.</note> amongſt other Diſeaſes, a ſoft white Swelling a little above her Knee on the outſide of her right Thigh. Many Applications having been ineffectually applied, Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and my ſelf were conſulted. We concluded it a Flatulent Tumour, and propoſed the opening of it; to which purpoſe ſhe was purged. Her Body being ſo prepared, I applied a Cauſtick on the moſt prominent part, and the next day divided the Eſcar, and paſſed my Knife deep into it: there came out nothing of Matter or Bloud. I made a ſearch with a Probe, and paſſed it almoſt to the Bone, meeting no other oppoſition by the way then a ſoft puffy membranous Fleſh, ſuch as is uſually ſeen in a Shoulder of Veal. I dreſſed it with Lenients, Emplaſters and Bandage.</p>
                     <p>The fourth day, the Phyſician being preſent, I took off the Dreſſings; on which there appeared little more Matter then what is uſuall from ſuch Eſcars. The Tumour continued, and was ſomewhat inflamed: it required Digeſtion. To which purpoſe I ſprinkled in about ℈j. of <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and dreſſed it up with Lenients as before. The third day after I dreſſed it again, and ſaw the Eſcar ſeparating, and the Abſceſſe digeſted. I dreſſed the Abſceſſe again with Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and the externall parts with <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi> By this method the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe digeſted, and the Tumour ſunk, and was cured as hath been above ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Many of theſe Tumours we meet with which are certainly raiſed by a <hi>Flatus,</hi> yet give no Sound, nor yet doth there appear any Wind to puff out upon opening.</p>
                     <p>In the time of the Wars a Souldier was brought to me much wounded.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> During his Cure we took notice of a large white Swelling on the outſide of one of his Thighs, which we ſuppoſed Matter: and after the Digeſtion of his Wounds I opened that Tumour. There iſſued out onely a little wateriſh Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, part whereof was tinctured with the bloud dropping from the inciſed Lips. There was neither crackling of Wind nor hollow Sound, yet the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſunk from that Dreſſing; and by Diſcutients and Exſiccants with good Bandage it was ſoon cured. Some other ſuch like Tumours I have met with, and cured accordingly.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about thirty years of age had a Swelling on her right Knee encompaſſing the <hi>Rotula:</hi> it had been growing about a year or two.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> I ſuppoſed it flatulent, and treated it as hath been ſet down in the method of Cure, by Fomentations, Embrocations and Emplaſters: but it heating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and encreaſing, I applied an <hi>Empl. è bolo,</hi> and cauſed a Knee-piece to be laced on: by the continued uſe of which the Swelling was reſtrained, and the Knee recovered its former ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Another about forty years of age, of a full Body, had a round ſoft Swelling lying on each ſide of the <hi>Rotula</hi> without alteration of colour in the Skin.<note place="margin">5. Obſervat.</note> It
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95669:82"/>had ſome time diſabled her from going up or down a pair of ſtairs, and often hazarded her falling in other motions. In this caſe I applied an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter <hi>ad herniam,</hi> with an addition of <hi>cerat. hyſſopi</hi> over each Tumour, and a Compreſs of brown Paper ſoaked in <hi>aqua fabrorum,</hi> over which a laced Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece was put on, and ſtreightned proportionably. By the renewing theſe Dreſſings once in a week or ten days the Swelling diſcuſſed, and her Knee recovered its former ſtrength: yet ſhe continued the wearing of the Bandage ſome years.</p>
                     <p>A young perſon having been ſome years afflicted with a Swelling in one of her Knees,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> after various Applications it increaſing, I was ſent for, and ſaw it overſpreading the Joint and Parts about, retaining the natural colour of the Skin. It yielded to the impreſſion of my fingers as a Bladder half blown up; by which I judged it flatulent. The Bone on the inſide of the Knee was alſo protuberant, which at their firſt diſcovery of the Tumour gave the Parents a ſuſpicion it was luxated. I began with a Fomentation made of a Decoction of ſome of thoſe Plants propoſed in the method of Cure, and embrocated it with <hi>unguent. nervinum,</hi> and with Wax made up a Cerote of the ſame, which I applied with good Bandage till I got a Knee-piece made. Being made I laced it on, and from that time repeated the Dreſſings once in a week or ten days. By this method the pain and Swelling diminiſhed, and ſhe walked on it with more ſtrength. Indeed the Cure of theſe chiefly depends on the well-lacing of them; for accordingly as it was ſtreightned, ſo the Swelling leſſened. The weather growing ſeaſonable, ſhe went to the <hi>Spa,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Bath:</hi> from whence returning no better, ſhe was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to my care. I then attempted the diſcuſſing it by Medicaments more powerfull: they heated the Tumour, and bliſtered it here and there, but did not leſſen it. After I had aſſwaged the heat by Lenients, and healed the Excoriations, I applied over the Tumour <hi>Empl. diaſulphuris Rulandii,</hi> laced on the Knee-piece again, and renewed the Application once in ten days. In their over-hard lacing of this Bandage the Leg ſwelled: to prevent which, I cauſed a laced Stocking to be put on it. By the wearing thereof the Knee-piece was laced with more advantage, and ſhe recovered ſtrength of it daily, to walk, dance, and viſit her Friends abroad. During this, Doctour <hi>Micklethwait</hi> being in the houſe viſited my Patient, preſcribed ſuch Internalls as were proper for her, and propoſed the embrocating of the Tumour <hi>cum oleo ſulph. terebinth.</hi> which was uſed daily for ſome time. Afterwards a Pultice was adviſed of the tops of green Wormwood, Rue, Sage and Feverfew, with Hogs greace: this was applied till it became offenſive to her. After theſe ſeveral Applications, it appearing to them more viſibly that her Cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the well lacing of her Knee-piece, there was taken more care therein by her Servants, and a warm Cerote applied under it. The Tumour leſſened, and is ſince very much diminiſhed. I have lately taken off the Plaiſter and laced Stocking, and hope in few weeks ſhe may leave off the Knee-piece, the Swelling being now inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman came to <hi>London</hi> with a puffy Swelling on her left Foot near her Toes;<note place="margin">7. Obſervat.</note> part of the Swelling ſtretched over the Toe next the little one, on which the Tumour was near two fingers breadth. It was without Inflammation or conſiderable pain. I ſuppoſed it to be Wind, and would have given vent to it; but, not being permitted, I endeavoured then by Diſcutients to ſcatter it: it inflamed, and would not yield thereto. I then applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> and put on a laced Sock with a Bracer tacked to it for that Toe, and by Compreſſe and carefull Lacing ſuppreſſed the Swelling, and gave her ſo much eaſe, that after ſome time it hindred her not form taking
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95669:82"/>thoſe Divertiſements others her School-fellows did. After ſhe had worn this Sock ſome months, ſhe left off the uſe of Emplaſters, but continued the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage ſome years. The Swelling on her Foot is ſince diſcuſſed, but the Toe continues ſtill big, yet inconſiderably to what it was.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus far treated of Tumours by <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Wind;</hi> it remaineth now that I ſay ſomewhat of a Tumour made by the <hi>interpoſition of a ſolid Body.</hi> Examples of this nature are frequently to be found in ſome ſorts of <hi>Hernia,</hi> viz. the <hi>zirbalis</hi> and <hi>inteſtinalis,</hi> the falling out of the Kell or Guts, which, being both of them ſolid Bodies, are often interpoſed preternaturally between ſeverall Coats of the <hi>Peritonaeum, Scrotum,</hi> or other adjacent places, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the Tumour an <hi>Hernia</hi> of that Part where it is raiſed.</p>
                     <p>If is burſt out at or near the Navell, extending there the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> together with the ſeverall Tendons of the oblique and tranſverſe Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Kinds. <hi>Exomphalos.</hi>
                        </note> it is called <hi>Exomphalos.</hi> If either of theſe break down into the Cod, that Tumour is moſt ſtrictly called a <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hernia.</note> And though onely theſe which I have here mentioned be ſtrictly that Diſeaſe, yet other Tumours of thoſe Parts, for their likeneſs to theſe, obtain the ſame name: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hernia aquoſa,</hi> which is an Hydropicall Tumour; the <hi>Hernia carnoſa,</hi> which is a <hi>Sarcoma,</hi> or ſometimes <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> of that Part; the <hi>Hernia ventoſa,</hi> which alſo belongs to another Head, as alſo doth <hi>varicoſa:</hi> of the former notwithſtanding of theſe two I do adde ſomething in this place, by reaſon of the affinity of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall firſt begin with the <hi>Hernia Scroti, inteſtinalis</hi> and <hi>zirbalis:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hernia Scroti.</note> both which are manifeſtly the falling down of the Gut or Kell, either quite into the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which is a perfect <hi>Rupture;</hi> or elſe part of the way onely, which is uſually termed a <hi>Relaxation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this Diſeaſe may be throughly underſtood, it will be neceſſary to give you an exact account of the Parts concerned. The principall is the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or ſtrong Membrane that lines all the inſdie of the Abdominall Muſcles, and then paſſing to the Back, doth there ſome way or other involve and give Coats to all the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> It is a ſtrong Membrane, every-where double; in the dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of which all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> are hid, and through which all the Veſſells do paſs. Its thickneſs and thinneſs is very different in ſeverall Parts, according to the ſeverall neceſſities of Nature. The lower part of it is ſtrongeſt, to enable the Belly the better to bear the weight of the Inteſtines; and is uſually preſumed by inadvertent men to be perforated in the Navell, for paſſing of the Umbilicall Veſſells, and in the Groin, for the tranſmiſſion of the Seminalls. But he that will conſider the caſe will find it otherwiſe. For the Membrane, being every-where double, doth ſo receive theſe Veſſells between its Coats, as that they paſſing behind the firſt Coat leave it every-where intire, both at the Navell and <hi>Inguen.</hi> But in the latter place, the Seminalls do take the outward <hi>Lamina,</hi> of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> along with them, which, containing them in it ſelf, doth at length make that Tunicle which involveth the Teſticle, by the name of <hi>Tunica vaginalis</hi> or <hi>Elytroides.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This, I ſay, is the moſt naturall ſtructure of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> in which if the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95669:83"/>inward <hi>Lamina</hi> be ſtrong, it keeps within the hollow of the Belly the Guts and Humours, if there, ſo that though the Cavity be full of water, yet it tranſmits nothing into the <hi>Scrotum;</hi> and the Tumours that happen to the <hi>Scrotum</hi> of Hydropicall perſons are uſually anaſarcous, coming outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Membranes of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> not paſſing from one Cavity to the other.</p>
                     <p>But if this inward <hi>Lamina,</hi> either through its own weakneſs, or the force put upon it in ſtraining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do relax, the Entrals thruſt forwards to the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and in the top of the Proceſs (uſually ſo called) ſuffer an Angle to be excavated wherein part of the Guts is contained, and the Membrane extended, but not broken. In which caſe the membranous partition that intercedes between the Guts and the <hi>Scrotum</hi> is viſible. But if the Membrane break, then the Entrals ruſh down without controll into the <hi>Scrotum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Women alſo Ruptures are apt to happen in the Groin in the ſame place by reaſon of the tranſition of the <hi>Ligamenta uteri teretia,</hi> which paſs between the <hi>Laminae</hi> of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> after the ſame manner as the Seminall Veſſells do in men. Theſe Tumours uſually end in the Groin, and are known by the name of <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> which is a common name to all the <hi>Herniae</hi> in that place, whether they be in men or women.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis</hi> and <hi>zirbalis</hi> are divers.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> In Children it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from abundance of crudity or moiſture, vehement crying, and holding their breath too forcibly. In thoſe of more age, from violent Exerciſe, hard riding, jumping, vaulting, hallowing, carrying great burthens, a Blow or Fall, or any thing that many over-ſtretch the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> The very weight of the Bowells and Kell in fat people is often the occaſion of a Rupture. In ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Vomiting may be a cauſe; yea the very ſtraining upon the Cloſe-ſtool (if they be coſtive) is enough to make a Relaxation in ſome part, and a Rupture frequently followeth.</p>
                     <p>In Women hard labour in Childbed hath often been the Cauſe of a Rupture in the Groin, as alſo in the Navell.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>Hernia</hi> by Relaxation is, a certain Eminence or ſoft Tumour appearing under the Skin in either of the Groins, or other part of the Belly, without Inflammation or pain,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> which diſappeareth after the Patient hath layn ſome time on his back in bed, and appeareth again when he is up: and by laying your hand then upon it, if he cough or ſneeze, you will feel the impulſe of the Bowells, which is not to be felt on the ſound part. According as this Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is greater or leſs, ſo it is more or leſs accompained with an uneaſineſs or Colick. In Infants this Diſeaſe is ſcarce taken notice of by their Nurſes, till it hath made its way into or near the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> to which place theſe through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect do fall.</p>
                     <p>The Sign of a <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis</hi> made by Eruption is, the ſudden riſe of the Tumour, whether it be made by Blow, Fall, or the like; in which caſe the Inteſtines or <hi>Omentum,</hi> or both, ſlide down into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> or lie in a great Tumour <hi>in Inguine.</hi> If it were cauſed by a Blow or Fall, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bloud extravaſated, and the Swelling is painfull, whether it be <hi>in Inguine</hi> or <hi>Scroto;</hi> and it ſoon deſcendeth from the <hi>Inguen</hi> to the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> where you may diſtinguiſh it from a <hi>Sarcoma</hi> by laying your hand upon the Production of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> juſt at its <hi>Exit</hi> from the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> then putting the Patient upon coughing or ſneezing: upon either of theſe you will perceive the motion of the Gut, if it be there. If this <hi>Hernia</hi> be neglected in the Female ſex, it will make a round Tumour near the <hi>Pudenda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hernia omentalis</hi> is an unequall ſoft ſlippery Tumour, of a continued bigneſs, whether the Patient be full or empty: whereas that of the Inteſtine is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95669:83"/>round, and hath a certain murmuring, if it be empty; and if it be full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, they may be felt in it. The Tumour is alſo greater or leſs according as the Patient is full or empty: a painfull Colick attends it; and, if it be not timely reduced, a Fever and Vomiting followeth.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hernia umbilicalis</hi> is diſcerned by the Prominence in the Navell. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Inteſtines, may be judged by what I have already ſaid of the other.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pneumatocele</hi> or <hi>Hernia ventoſa,</hi> affecting the Belly in divers parts, is diſtinguiſht by its quick growth and roundneſs. Infants are frequently ſubject to it, ſometimes in one Groin and Teſticle, and other times in both. It lodgeth between the Teſticle and <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> making a Tumour like the Bladders which are found in ſome Fiſh: it is long or round, according as it poſſeſſeth onely the cavity of the Teſticle, or that and the whole Production.</p>
                     <p>No <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis</hi> is without danger:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick</note> thoſe made by Relaxation are leaſt dangerous. Thoſe by Ruption in Children and Youth under twenty years of age, or while they are growing, are curable if they be timely reduced, though the Inteſtine be fallen down into the <hi>Scrotum:</hi> but in people of full growth they are for the moſt part capable onely of being kept up by good Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. If the Inteſtine be not ſpeedily reduced, there followeth grievous pain, with Colick and Fever, becauſe the excretion of Excrements is prohibited; from whence Inflammation, vomiting of Excrements, yea ſometimes Gangrene and Death, inſue. But if the Rupture in the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be very large, the Inteſtines frequently perform their office as ſafely in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> as if they were in their naturall place within the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hernia umbilicalis</hi> is ſubject to the like Accidents as that of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> if not timely reduced.</p>
                     <p>In other caſes the Skin is ſometimes worn ſo thin that it breaks, and the Cure is moſt difficult, by reaſon of continuall preſſure of the Bowells.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hernia omentalis</hi> is not dangerous, yet by reaſon of its ſoftneſs and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs it is difficultly reduced, and retained within after it is reduced, but in Children it is of eaſy Cure: and thoſe people who are of a ſanguine and humid Temper are of more hopes of Cure then thoſe of a dry Habit. Yet if the Tumour be ſmall and recent, and onely <hi>in Inguine,</hi> the Cure is feaſible, be the Habit of body what it will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hernia</hi> ariſing from Wind is of more eaſy Cure, eſpecially in Children, whom it generally afflicts.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure,</hi> you are to conſider the <hi>Hernia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure</note> whether it be <hi>inteſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> or <hi>omentalis,</hi> recent or of long continuance, made by Relaxation or Ruption. You are in the firſt place to endeavour the reduction of it; to which purpoſe, you ought to adviſe the Patient to lie upon his Back, with his Head declining, and his Hips raiſed high, with his Heels retracted towards his Hips. Then with warm cloaths you are to try how you can reduce it, preſſing moderately and gradually, taking care that you do not bruiſe it or the Teſticle. If it yields not to ſuch endeavours, you are then to conſider whether the repletion of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Crudity were the Cauſe; in which caſes you may preſcribe a Clyſter: ℞ <hi>rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, fol. malvae, viol. betae, parietariae, an.</hi> M.j. <hi>flor. cham. melilot. ſambuci, an.</hi> Mſs. <hi>ſem. lini, foenugraec. an.</hi>

Theſe may be repeated till you have emptied the Bowells, and the while the remaining Decoction may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied hot with Stupes: and if the Excrements by hardned in the prolapſed Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, you may make a Cataplaſm of the <hi>Faeces,</hi> by beating them up with <hi>axung.

If Flatulency be the cauſe of its not reducing, foment and embrocate with ſuch Diſcutients as have been propoſed in <hi>Flatulent Tumours,</hi> (if what is preſcribed be not ſufficient;) then reduce the <hi>Hernia:</hi> which being done, your next work will be to ſhut up the <hi>Foramen</hi> by which the <hi>Omentum</hi> and Inteſtines paſſed forth; and that we ſhall propoſe with Medicaments that have a binding and agglutinative quality.

Thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the <hi>Bubonocele</hi> have a couple of Straps tacked to the end of the Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and, paſſing betwixt, are faſtned with Points behind. Theſe Truſſes are proper for Infants and tender bodies, where the Rupture is recent, and for the moſt part made by Relaxation. They are neceſſary in the Cure of Ruptures in people of years, and have always ſerved my prupoſe in the Cure of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There is great care required in the putting them on and wearing them. In Children it is the work of Nurſes or Maid-ſervants, who frequently tie them too ſlack about the Loyns, and too ſtreight betwixt the Legs; by which negligence they bring the Truſs over the Buttock, or elſe permit the Rupture to ſlide down under the Boulſter into the <hi>Scrotum:</hi> all which Errours, though they be forewarned, yet they do often commit, and thereby the Cure is delayed, and imputed to the Ignorance or Neglect of the Chirurgeon. To avoid which, we are ſometimes neceſſitated to put them on Straps over the Shoulders, ſuch as Labourers commonly wear to keep up their Breeches. Nor indeed are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren onely ſufferers in this caſe, for people of full age, by reaſon of careleſneſs in putting on and wearing their Truſſes, permit ſmall <hi>Herniae</hi> by Relaxation in <hi>Bubonocele</hi> to increaſe and ſlide down <hi>in Scrotum.</hi> To prevent which in Men, I commonly order a Bag-truſs to be faſtned near the Boulſter, by which the <hi>Scrotum</hi> is tucked up, and rendred the leſs capable of receiving the prolapſed <hi>Omentum</hi> or Inteſtine. In Women, through ignorance and ſhyneſs in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſmall <hi>Herniae in Inguine</hi> do alſo increaſe to a great bulk: in which caſe a hollow Boulſter-truſs may be fitted proportionably to the Rupture, or a Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſs, to retain it up. In Men, through the often deſcent of the Bowells, the Eruption is made ſome times ſo large, that the Inteſtines doe their office in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> with as little diſturbance as if they were in the Belly: in which caſe a Bag-truſs is to be proportioned, with a hole for the <hi>Penis</hi> to paſs through; which being put on whilſt the Patient is in bed, and in a declining poſture, will much hinder the prolapſe of the Bowells, and eaſe the Patient much in his going abroad about his affairs; and by the continuance of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon and his endeavours the Rupture may be reſtored to good condition. Theſe ſorts of Truſſes are well made by Mr. <hi>Syms</hi> in <hi>Bell-alley</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi>

                     <p>There are other ſorts of Truſſes made of Whale-bone. The ſtuffing of the Boulſter is placed upon Cork, which will ſit firm upon Children and Youth. There are others made of thin <hi>Laminae</hi> of Tin and Steel, with and without Joynts, which do ſit eaſily about the Loyns: they have alſo Boulſters, that, by virtue of Worms and Screws fixed in them, do ſit cloſer or more diſtant, and retain the Rupture up without preſſing upon the Spermatick Veſſells or <hi>Os pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:95669:84"/>They are uſefull in old <hi>Herniae.</hi> Theſe are made by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who lives near <hi>Fleet-bridge.</hi> He is the moſt ingenious man in that work, and maketh the beſt Truſſes for the retaining the <hi>Hernia umbilicalis</hi> within its bounds. But in great fat Bellies we find it often neceſſary to put them on a Bracer to encompaſs the Belly, which may be laced behind or on one ſide, to bear part of its weight.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far provided for the retaining the <hi>Hernia</hi> within its bounds, you ought to have the Hair ſhaved, if there be any, and apply Agglutinatives with good Bandage. If the Boulſter ſit uneaſy, a Quilt may be made to lie under it, or a Compreſs of brown Paper ſoak'd in <hi>aqua fabrorum</hi> wherein ſome Aſtringents have been boiled; by which your Truſs will ſit the eaſier, and retain the relaxed or torn Parts, and thereby they may be the ſooner aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
                     <p>Our next conſideration will be matter of Diet and manner of living. Their Diet ought to be ſparing, but of good nouriſhment. as Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Pullet, Chicken and the like; avoiding all Herbage, Fruit, Fiſh, and White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, ſuch as may ingender Crudities. Their Bread ought to be of Wheat, with carminative Seeds in it. The confected <hi>ſemina carui, coriandri, foeniculi,</hi> and the like, are commended after Dinner and at other times to further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. Their Drink a red Wine with a little Water wherein gads of Steel have been quenched; or Ale wherein ſome of the ſpecifick Plants have been infuſed.</p>
                     <p>Reſt is of great advantage in the Cure of theſe <hi>Herniae. Fabritius Hildanus</hi> and others who have writ of this Diſeaſe will tell you, that ſome have been cured of great Ruptures by keeping their bed upon ſome accident of a Fracture, or fit of the Gout, when before their beſt endeavours in the Cure ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. In conſideration of which they forbid all manner of Exerciſe; and adviſe them that, whilſt they keep their beds, they ſhould often feel with their hands about the Part affected, principally in caſe of any ſudden Sneezing or violent Coughing, and eſpecially in eaſing nature by Stool, that, if any Relapſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it may be helped. But that you may the better avoid ſuch Accidents, you ought to keep their Bodies ſoluble by Clyſters, Suppoſitories, or lenient Electuaries. Where the pituitous Humours abound, they require ſometime alſo to be purged; for which I refer you to the Chapter of <hi>Oedema.</hi> After it may be proper to preſcribe ſome Agglutinatives; and they are either ſimple, or compound.</p>
                     <p>The ſimple are reckoned among the Vulnerary Plants; not all of them, but ſuch as have a moderate Aſtringency, and are without remarkable heat or acrimony, and have ſpecificall virtue. Such are <hi>conſolid. maj. &amp; minor, quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefolium, equiſetum, ſanicula, auricula urſi, piloſella, jacea utraque, ſigill. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis, tormentilla, oſmunda regalis, hippogloſſum, lunaria min. perfoliata, herniaria, herba trinitatis, cort. cypreſſ. granat.</hi> &amp;c. The diſtilled water of <hi>oſmunda regalis</hi> is commended in the Cure, ſo are alſo <hi>piloſella, hippogloſſum, lunaria,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally given in a Powder in a Decoction of Comfry-roots. <hi>Perfoliata</hi> and <hi>her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaria</hi> are delivered to us to be of ſo great virtue as to cure this Diſeaſe in few days, conditionally the Rupture be kept in by a good Bandage. They may be given as Tea; or they may be juiced or powdered, and mixt with red Wine.</p>

                     <p>If after the forementioned endeavours to reduce the <hi>Hernia,</hi> (whether it were by reaſon it had been too long relapſed, and the Excrements grown hard and dried in the Inteſtine, or that they were ſtuffed with Crudities, or inflamed by the conſtriction in the Production, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) you do not ſucceed, you ought to conſider what the impediment is, and proceed accordingly to let bloud, purge or vomit, or put him into a <hi>Semicupium,</hi> keeping on his Bag-truſs the while: after which he may if occaſion require, be carried to and ſo fro upon the back of a ſtrong man with his Head downward, by which the prolapſed Bowells are often reduced. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Truſs-maker told me he had made ſuch an Engine by which he ſet them on their Heads, and thereby had reduced many, which could not otherwiſe be relieved.</p>
                     <p>But the aforeſaid ways, I bleſs God, have ſerved the moſt deplorable Patient labouring of theſe Diſeaſes under my hands. Yet if it ſhould ſo happen, that all endeavours of this kind prove ineffectuall, and the Patient's life be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by frequent vomiting and inflation of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and nothing paſs through him by Stool, I would ask whether in ſuch a caſe it be not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to offer in Conſultation the laying open the Production while there is ſtrength, then to ſuffer the Patient miſerably to periſh under the Diſeaſe. I refer it to the judicious Artiſt, there ſeeming nothing of difficulty or danger in the work; yet would not have it attempted whilſt there is hope of otherwiſe reducing it.</p>
                     <p>To perform this Operation, the Patient ought to be laid flat on his Back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Table or Form, and bound thereon; then an Inciſion muſt be made upon the upper part of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> to the Production, which requireth alſo to be divided, without touching the Inteſtines or <hi>Omentum:</hi> then you are to paſs in a <hi>Cannula</hi> (like our common Directour, but as big as a large Gooſe-quill) into the Cavity under the Proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> upwards, avoiding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; then make your Inciſion of ſuch a length as may ſerve to put your fingers into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and raiſe the Inteſtines and <hi>Omentum,</hi> which you are to reduce into their natural place within the Belly. They being thus redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, you muſt ſtitch up the Wound, as is ſaid in the Wounds of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> taking up with your Needle ſo much of the Production as may ſhut up the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and prohibit the relapſe of the Inteſtines. That done, cure the Wound, as is ſhewed in the Treatiſe of thoſe Wounds; it not being ſo large or dangerous as many of thoſe we have cured in the Wars.</p>
                     <p>In the farther Cure of theſe, various ways have been propoſed by Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>viz.</hi> the actuall and potentiall Cautery, alſo Puncture and Deligation of the Proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> alſo Inciſion, with or without extraction of the Teſticle. Theſe ways are not practiſed amongſt our people, they eſteeming ſuch Operations full of hazard and cruelty: yet they having been delivered to us by good Authority, I ſhall ſhew you how they are performed, and begin with that of the actuall Cautery. In the effecting of which work there are required various ſorts of Buttons, ſome bigger and leſs then other. Whilſt theſe are in the fire, the Patient muſt ſtand, and hold in his breath, by which doing the Tumour <hi>in Inguine</hi> will be more apparent. Then it is to be circumſcribed within a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure: after which the Patient being placed on his Back, preſs with your hot Cautery on the middle of that Triangle, and repeat it often, making the form of the Greek Letter Γ ſo deep till you reach to the <hi>Membrana adipoſa,</hi>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:95669:85"/>taking care you do not ſcorch the <hi>Peritonaeum:</hi> then dreſs the burned parts with a little Salt and an Onion beat together, and afterwards digeſt and heal the Ulcer as you find propoſed in the Chapter of <hi>Burns,</hi> he keeping his bed till he be cured. By this method the Authour propoſeth a contraction of the Skin by reaſon of the <hi>Cicatrix.</hi> How this will doe without the wearing of a Truſs, I much ſuſpect.</p>
                     <p>Another propoſeth the reducing of the <hi>Hernia,</hi> and the thruſting up of the Teſticle to the <hi>Os pubis;</hi> then marketh the Compreſs of the Prominence made by the Teſticle, and, ſhoving it and its Veſſells out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> he burneth in the middle of that Mark (with a pointed Cautery a little curved) to the very Bone, then dreſſeth it <hi>cum albumine ovor.</hi> and cureth it as a burn: by which if he burneth the Bone, it muſt neceſſarily exſoliate, and unite with the Skin and fleſhy Parts over it, and hinder the prolapſe <hi>in Scrotum.</hi> But yet there muſt remain a <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> which will require a Boulſter-Truſs to prevent its ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down, as is frequently incident to Women.</p>
                     <p>The way by Cauſtick is propounded by others as more eaſy. The mildeſt of them is Soap-lees boiled to a ſtone, with the addition of <hi>ſevum vitulin.</hi> and a fourth part of <hi>opium</hi> added to it at the laſt. The other are as followeth. ℞ <hi>vitrioli uſti</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſalis ammoniaci</hi> ℥j. <hi>calcis vivae, ciner. è vini faece, an.</hi> ℥iij. theſe muſt be bruiſed and mixed with a <hi>lixivium è cineribus ſicuum &amp; tithymall.</hi> then ſtrained out and boiled to a ſtone. Or, ℞ <hi>ſalis nitri, chalcitidis, an.</hi> ℥x. diſtill them, and caſt away the firſt water, it being black and unfit for uſe. The ſecond Diſtillation is clear, and muſt be put into a Glaſs bottle, in which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve <hi>arſenici albi</hi> ℥ij. <hi>tartari albi uſti, merc. ſublimati, an.</hi> ℥j. then put it into a copper Veſſell, and by a moderate heat conſume the humidity; the remaining <hi>faeces</hi> is the Cauſtick.</p>
                     <p>In order to the applying of any of theſe Cauſticks, the Part muſt be marked, and the Patient afterwards laid upon a Table, as hath been ſaid in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Operations; then the Cauſtick is to be applied croſs-wiſe, an inch long and as much tranſverſe, near the <hi>Os pubis;</hi> which having operated to the Bone, it's ſuppoſed that Bone ſhall exfoliate, and the <hi>Callus</hi> ariſing from it will unite with the Ulcer in the fleſhy Pannicles and Skin, and ſtop the deſcent of the <hi>Viſcera:</hi> which notwithſtanding cannot prevent a <hi>Bubonocele.</hi> Another way is by the application of a Cauſtick <hi>in Inguine,</hi> then to raiſe off the Eſcar, and, taking up the <hi>Membrana adipoſa</hi> with a Hook, to divide it, and free the Seminall Veſſells from the Proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> Then paſs a Needle with crude Silk under it, tie it cloſe, and leaving it hanging out digeſt the Ulcer, incarn and cicatrize it; during which the Silk will have cut through, and fall off: and the Production uniting with the Wound abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Cure. The Cure by Puncture is the invention of ſome of the Moderns, and is ſet down by <hi>Ambroſe Pareus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There yet remain two ways of Cure by Inciſion: in order to which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt ſtand upright, as hath already been ſaid, that the Rupture by falling down may plainly diſcover its bigneſs, and that the Part ſo ſwell'd may be incompaſſed with a circle: after which the Patient muſt be laid flat on a Table, with his Heels raiſed up, as in the forementioned caſes: then one of the Aſſiſtents ſhall preſs with his hand upon the bottom of his Belly, whilſt the Chirurgeon with his left hand raiſeth up the marked Skin as much as he can, then divideth it with his Knife long-ways down the length of the Proceſs or <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> ſo as to open that Coat, and lay the Seminall Veſſells bare; which he is to avoid the hurting whilſt he takes up the divided Tunicle, and ſtitcheth it with the Skin ſo cloſe that the <hi>Hernia</hi> may be retained within the Belly from ſtarting out. Then by Agglutinatives, as <hi>bol. Armen. ſang. dracon.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95669:86"/>thus, aloe, cum albumine ovi,</hi> dreſs it up, and place him in his bed. If after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there be occaſion to apply Digeſtives, ℞ <hi>vitell. ovor. num.</hi> ij. <hi>far. tritic. thuris pulv. q. ſ.</hi> After which you may deterge with <hi>mundif. apii,</hi> and incarn with ſome ſuch like Sarcotick: ℞ <hi>terebinth. ſiccat.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>thuris, maſtich. ſem. foenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graec. an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>cerae</hi> ℥j. <hi>ol. hyperici</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>x. <hi>Miſc. S. A.</hi> Then cicatrize it as in other like Wounds.</p>
                     <p>The Empiricall way is by extraction of the Teſticle: in the doing of which the Patient muſt be laid on his Back, as afore mentioned, and bound faſt upon the place: then the Inteſtines being reduced, the Aſſiſtent ſhall retain them up with his hands, whilſt the Operator maketh an oblique Mark in the Groin, to which place he thruſteth up the Teſticle; then makes an Inciſion ſo deep and large upon it, as to take it out with the ſpermatick Veſſells, which he holdeth with the one hand, while with the other he ſeparates it from the Membranes. (In all which caſes he muſt be carefull not to lacerate them, for thereby he ſhall cauſe Convulſions, and haſten the death of the Patient.) That done, he maketh a Ligature above the Teſticle upon the Veſſells, and cuts it off. If there be fear of a flux of bloud, he cauterizeth the ends ſo tied: then, re-placing them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Belly, leaving the ends of the Ligature hanging out, he ſtitcheth up the Wound, dreſſing as above ſaid: and during the time of Cicatrizing the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture falls off.</p>
                     <p>In order to theſe Operations the Patient ought to be of a ſtrong Conſtitution and well habited, his Bowells emptied by Purging and Clyſters, and to be very ſparing in his Diet, at leaſt three or four days preceding the Work. But I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet met one that would ſubmit to any of theſe ways.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the <hi>Bubonocele</hi> in Women requireth its being reduced and cured as thoſe in Men, by Emplaſters and good Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed in thoſe.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Hernia umbilicalis</hi> the Cure alſo conſiſts in the well reducing of it, and in the retaining it ſo by Agglutinatives and good Bandage. If through neglect of treating it timely, as aforeſaid, the Skin do wear thin and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, you muſt dreſs it as ſuch: and after the ſeparation of the Eſcars, you muſt then endeavour to take up the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> ſtitch it cloſe together, and incarn it with the reſt of the Ulcer, as hath been ſhewed: and after it is cicatrized, endeavour by good Bandage to retain it more eaſily within its bounds.</p>
                     <p>There is ſcarce any Diſeaſe little Infants are more ſubject unto then Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They are not difficult of Cure, if their Nurſes would be carefull to keep their Truſſes well on: but, through their negligence therein, the Cure is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rendred vexatious. Therefore I ſhall begin my Obſervations with them.</p>
                     <p>AN Infant of about four months old was diſcovered to have a Swelling in the left <hi>Inguen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> another in the Navell, and another three fingers breadth higher. That in the Groin, which we generally call <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> was made by Relaxation of the Inteſtine, as appeared by the noiſe it made in the time of Reduction. The other two proceeded from Wind. I took the compaſs of his Hips with a Ribbon, and the next day brought a ſoft Boulſter-Truſs of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> linen, with two Straps faſtned to the Boulſter: and, having applied an <hi>Empl. ad berniam</hi> ſpred upon Lambskin on the Tumour in the Groin, I fitted the Boulſter to it, and reduced it, then tied it on; then paſſing the Straps between his Legs, I faſtned them with Points on each ſide behind; by which the Rupture was retained within the Boulſter, not preſſing upon the Thigh or God. On the Rupture of the Navell, or <hi>Hernia umbilicalis,</hi> I applied a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>pulver. thuris, maſtich. aloes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſang. draconis, cum albumine ovi,</hi> and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95669:86"/>made a Compreſſion with an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> by a ſmall Button ſticking in the middle thereof, made of ſome ſnips of the ſame Emplaſter, by which the Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter under it was retained the cloſer. On the other above the Navell I applied a Compreſs made by ſome pieces of <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> and retained them cloſe by applying over them <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo.</hi> By this method theſe <hi>Herniae</hi> were cured in few weeks. For that in the Groin they had half a dozen Truſſes ſent them, for ſhift as occaſion offered; and it was cured thereby in few months.</p>
                     <p>A Child about two months old laboured of ſome Indiſpoſition of body,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis.</hi>
                        </note> and was obſerved to have a Swelling in the right God. In preſſing upon it with my fingers, it ſeemed to me not to lie looſe in the <hi>Scrotum:</hi> it yielded to a moderate preſſure; and being ſomewhat reduced, the reſidue of it jerked ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly up with a noiſe, which confirmed it a <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis</hi> by Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I took the compaſs of his Loyns to the Groin, and the next day brought him an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> with ſome Boulſter-Truſſes. I reduced the Rupture as eaſily as I had done the day before, then applied the Emplaſter, fitted the Boulſter over it, and tied it moderately ſtreight. Theſe Truſſes had the Straps ſtitched on behind; they were brought between his Thighs, and faſtned to the upper part of the Boulſter croſs each other by Points. I ſhewed the Nurſe how they were to be put, and gave her caution leſt the Boulſter ſhould at any time gall the Thigh or <hi>Scrotum,</hi> or that by too ſtrict a Bandage the Hip ſhould be hurt, or by too ſlack a Bandage the <hi>Hernia</hi> ſhould ſlide down under the Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or whilſt it was looſe tied thoſe Straps between the Legs ſhould be tied ſo ſtreight as to bring the Bandage over his Hanches and ſlip down. Having thus forewarned her, I made my viſits the ſeldomer, as not deſiring to appear too officious; and indeed was fetched the next day to a Patient ſome miles off, where I ſtaid three weeks. At my return I made a viſit to this little one, and felt the Rupture ſlipt down into the <hi>Scrotum</hi> by reaſon of the ſlackneſs of the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; and the Nurſe had pulled the Straps between the Thighs ſo over-ſtreight as to bring the Bracer down, and would not believe it could be kept up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bandage from the Shoulders. But I reduced the Rupture, tied it ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſlackened the Straps between the Thighs, and ſhewed her it could not fall over the Buttocks whilſt it was ſo tied. The next Errour ſhe committed was in bracing it too ſtreight about the Hips, whereby ſhe had gauled it on the right Hip; and then ſhe complained to her Lady, that it was not poſſible to cure the Child without giving it ſome healing Drinks: ſuch and ſuch had been cured ſo in few days. To this I replied, That the Cure conſiſted in the keeping up the Rupture; that done, it would cure without Drinks: That there was but little to be given to ſuch an Infant. Yet I wiſhed them to conſult their Phyſician therein. I applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. diachalciteos</hi> upon the Excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with two or three folds of ſoft linen over it, and braced the Bandage ſlacker: by which Dreſſings the Excoriation cured, the Nurſe became more experienced, and the Child was happily recovered in few weeks; but left not off the wearing the Truſs till the Summer following.</p>
                     <p>I was fetched to a Child half a year old having a Swelling <hi>in Scroto</hi> on the left ſide. It was a <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis</hi> by Relaxation. I reduced it eaſily,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis.</hi>
                        </note> and the next day fitted it with a ſoft Boulſter-Truſs; and, having reduced it, applied <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> put on the Bandage, and ſupplied them with more Truſſes for change, (they being apt to bepiſs them daily, ſo that, if they be not carefully attended, they are ſubject to Excoriation.) Once in four or five days I called in to ſee how the Nurſe ordered her affair; and by her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the Child was cured in few weeks, but continued the uſe of the Truſs till it was grown ſtronger, and had bred his Teeth.</p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:95669:87"/>
                     <p>A Youth aged eleven years had been ſome months diſeaſed with a Rupture before his Friends diſcovered it:<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis.</hi>
                        </note> through which neglect it fell into the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and indiſpoſed him with Colicks. I was ſent for, and ſaw it an <hi>Hernia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis</hi> on the left ſide. I endeavoured to reduce it, but could not. I then took meaſure of his Loyns, and the next morning found him in bed, and placed him on his Back, with his Hips high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with warm cloaths reduced the Rupture: then put him on a Boulſter-Truſs made of ſtrong <hi>Holland,</hi> with a couple of Straps faſtened to the lower part of the Boulſter; and having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened the Truſs about his Loyns with Points, I brought the Straps between his Legs, and tied them behind. Thus I retained the Rupture. The next day I made him a viſit, and ſeeing the Rupture well retained, I looſened the Bandage, applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> and braced it on again, leaving Directions with his Servant to take care in the bracing the Truſs cloſe every morning. This Patient was very active in running and playing daily; yet by the uſe of theſe Emplaſters and carefull Bandage, he was cured in few months, I ſcarce making him ſix viſits the while.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about ſix years of age was brought out of the Country,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis.</hi>
                        </note> having ſomewhile ſuffered under a <hi>Hernia in Scroto.</hi> He had a Truſs, but it was not well made. I laid him upon his Back, with his Heels retracted to his Hips. It did not preſently yield to a Reduction; whereupon I cauſed ſome warm cloaths to be applied, and then preſſed it moderately upward: it returned up with a murmuring noiſe. I then applied my Emplaſter and Bandage, and, having adviſed them concerning the uſe of the Truſs, I left them to proſecute the Cure, ſupplying them with Emplaſters and Bandage. About half a year after I ſaw hm cured.</p>
                     <p>A Youth of about nine years of age was brought to me out of the Country with a Swelling in his right Groin:<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> it was ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> and to that purpoſe Emplaſters and Truſſes had been put on, and the Part thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. I felt the Swelling, and, as I thought, the Teſticle which was wanting in the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> Upon which conſideration I forbad the uſe of the Truſs, and applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. oxelaei:</hi> by which the heat was removed, the Child freed of his Bandage, and the Teſticle left to fall down by degrees; which accordingly it did, and his Parents were well pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pneumatocele,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia ventoſa.</hi>
                        </note> or <hi>Hernia ventoſa,</hi> appeareth often <hi>in Inguine</hi> in the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> and maketh a Tumour not unlike that of the Teſticle. Such a one was brought to me in the Groin of a Child of about ſeven years of age. It was as big as a Pullet's egge, ſoft, but withall ſo tenſe that it yielded little to preſſure. It had been treated by Bandage, but yielded not thereto, but became more painfull. I preſcribed a Fomentation and Emplaſters, as hath been ſet down in <hi>Flatulent Tumours,</hi> and cauſed a ſoft Boulſter-Truſs to be put on, rather to keep it warm and retain the Dreſſings on, then to make any ſtreight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. I treated him by internalls proper in ſuch Tumours, by which he was ſome time after cured.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman brought a Son to <hi>London</hi> with a Swelling in his left Teſticle.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia ventoſa.</hi>
                        </note> Severall of our Profeſſion had ſeen it, but delivered no certain Judgement of it, nor preſcribed ought in order to the Cure. The Swelling was Wind gotten into the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> which encompaſſed the Teſticle round, ſo as I could not feel it. By reaſon of the Tumour, which was ſo tenſe that it would not yield to the preſſure of my fingers, I propoſed Diſcutients and a Bag-Truſs. They were diſſwaded from my Opinion by ſome who had rather their Friend ſhould fail of his Cure then receive it from me. Which hath ſomewhat appeared in this caſe: for two years after the Father of this Child told me he continued as I had formerly ſeen him.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95669:87"/>
                     <p>A Child about two years old had one of theſe Tumours lying the whole length of the Production the Teſticle,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia ventoſa.</hi>
                        </note> like unto the uppermoſt of thoſe Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which we find in Carps: and the ſame Wind, having raiſed up the <hi>Tunica vaginalis,</hi> made the Teſticle not unlike to the lower round Bladders that are united with the forementioned upper Bladders in the ſame Fiſh. The Cure was performed by Diſcutients and a Bag-Truſs.</p>
                     <p>I was fetcht to ſee a Child who was (as I ſuppoſe) not two months old:<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia ventoſa.</hi>
                        </note> it was a very ſmall Infant, much emaciated. A Swelling had been newly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>in Scroto,</hi> and ſuppoſed a Rupture: it affected the right <hi>Inguen</hi> down into the <hi>Tunica vaginalis.</hi> The Tunicle of the other Teſticle was likewiſe diſtended. And the next day, when I brought a Bag-Truſs, I found that <hi>Inguen</hi> alſo affected with the ſame Diſeaſe. Whilſt the Infant cried, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was much; but by an eaſy preſſure with warm cloaths it leſſened. I deſigned a Fomentation: but the weakneſs of the Child, together with its fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, deterred me. Whereupon I applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è cymino</hi> over the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and <hi>Inguina,</hi> and put on the Bag-Truſs. The next day I met the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, took off the Truſs and Emplaſters, and ſhewed them that it was a <hi>Hernia ventoſa,</hi> not capable of Reduction nor of other Bandage. There was alſo a <hi>Hernia umbilicalis,</hi> which was likewiſe from Wind, which I treated as hath been ſhewed in the firſt Obſervation. The Phyſicians reſolved the Milk ſhould be changed: upon doing of which the Child began to thrive. But this Nurſe not keeping the Child very dry, the Piſs fretted the Thighs and Cod: upon which account I put on a <hi>Diachalciteos</hi> Emplaſter, and renewed it daily. It not onely cured the Excoriations, but alſo ſupplied the place of the other Plaiſter. During the Cure, I obſerved that upon good Bandage the Tumour appeared very inconſiderable, and ſome times would be quite diſcuſſed: but then through neglect in bracing the Truſs cloſe, it would appear very big. The laſt time I ſaw the Child it was grown fat, and the Flatulency ſeemingly diſcuſſed: but a Rupture appeared in both Groins. Upon which account a double Boulſter-Truſs was put on, whereby it is kept up, and in a hopefull way of Cure.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about thirty years of age, of a full Body,<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of <hi>Bubonocele.</hi>
                        </note> having ſome time a Swelling in his left Groin, conſulted me. I declared it a <hi>Hernia inguinalis,</hi> and adviſed the uſe of a Boulſter-Truſs, which accordingly I brought the next day, with an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam;</hi> which, after I had ſhaved the Hair, I put on, and left him Directions how to wear it. He carefully obſerving the Direction, it was in ſome months happily cured.</p>
                     <p>A Man of a full Body, by a Fall in riding,<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of <hi>Bubonocele.</hi>
                        </note> bruiſed his left <hi>Inguen</hi> and that ſide of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> againſt the Pummell of his Saddle, by reaſon whereof a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made in his Groin, and much bloud was extravaſated in the <hi>Inguen</hi> and <hi>Scrotum</hi> to the very Praepuce. It was too late to apply Repellents, therefore I preſcribed this following Fomentation: ℞ <hi>ſummit. majoranae, abſinth. flor. cham. ſambuci, an.</hi>

Theſe were boiled with ſome of the Fomentation, and towards the latter end ſome Spirit of Wine, <hi>mel commun. ol. rutac.</hi> which was applied upon the diſeaſed Parts with a Bag-Truſs. We let the Patient bloud, preſcribed him Clyſters, and keeping of his bed during the Cure. This method of Dreſſing continued till the Swellings were diſcuſſed: then I ſhaved the Hair, and applied to the Groin a mixture of <hi>Emplaſtr. Paracelſ. &amp; diachalciteos,</hi> with a ſoft Boulſter-Truſs, to which a Bag was fitted for the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> to retain the Dreſſings on. Some few days after,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95669:88"/>obſerving that the <hi>Scrotum</hi> was over-moiſtned as in an <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> which hindred the corrugation of it, I applied <hi>Emplaſtr. diaſulphur.</hi> by which the Humour was dried up. After the tenderneſs of the Groin was removed, I applied <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> with a Quilt under the Boulſter, and braced it ſtreighter; then, having cauſed a leſs Bag to be ſtitched on to retain the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> I gave him leave to ſit up. His Rupture having been reduced from the firſt night I ſaw it, there was little doubt but his lying in bed had diſpoſed it to Cure. Indeed from that time I heard no more of it; but he continued the wearing his Truſs longer.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to one of about thirty ſix years old,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of <hi>Bubonocele.</hi>
                        </note> of a full Body: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a Swelling in his left Groin. It was a <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> and, by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reducing it, ſeemed to be of the <hi>Omentum.</hi> I applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> with a Boulſter-Truſs, and adviſed him how to govern it. I heard not from him again in five or ſix years; about which time being ſent for I found him in bed, bemoaning himſelf that his Rupture was fallen into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and he could not reduce it. I felt it lie unequally in the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> He had, it ſeemed, neglected the bracing of the Truſs while it lay <hi>in Inguine,</hi> and ſo it happened that in progreſs of time it ſlipped down under the Truſs; upon which he conſulted ſome, who put him on a Steel-Truſs: but that pinching and gauling, he cauſed others to be made, of which he ſhewed me at leaſt half a dozen; but they all hurt him, and did not keep his Rupture from falling down. But now it was ſo great, that he could not reduce it but with warm cloaths: which being done, I fitted to it a Boulſter-Truſs with a Quilt and Bag. To thoſe Excoriations occaſioned by his Steel-Truſs I applied <hi>Emplaſtr. oxelaei</hi> ſpred upon courſe linen, which ſoon cured them; and if his occaſions would have permitted him to have kept his bed, he might have been reſtored to a better condition: but this ſerved his turn as a palliative Cure.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about 30 years of age,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of <hi>Bubonocele.</hi>
                        </note> of a healthy Conſtitution, came to me with a <hi>Bubonocele.</hi> I adviſed him the wearing a Boulſter-Truſs with an Emplaſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: which for ſome time he did with much eaſe; but afterwards became more ſecure and careleſs in the bracing it, upon which the <hi>Omentum</hi> ſlid down half way into the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> It being yet within the Proceſs, I eaſily reduced it, and applied a freſh Emplaſter, and ſupplied him with more and new Truſſes. His affairs would not permit him to ſtay within doors, yet by his well ordering it he was cured in a few months, and for a triall he left off wearing the Truſs three or four days: but, having been uſed to it, he could not be without it; ſo that he continued the uſe of it, but without the Bag or Quilt.</p>
                     <p>Another of that age,<note place="margin">15. Obſervat. of <hi>Bubonocele.</hi>
                        </note> but not of ſo good a Habit of body, being diſeaſed with a <hi>Bubonocele,</hi> had for ſome time worn a Steel-Truſs: but the <hi>Hernia</hi> ſlid down <hi>in Scrotum</hi> notwithſtanding, though often reduced, and the Truſs braced more cloſe. Upon an extraordinary relapſe, when endeavours of his own failed, I was ſent for, and upon examination found the Inteſtine and <hi>Omentum</hi> both <hi>in Scroto.</hi> I could not reduce them by warm cloaths, therefore preſcribed him a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and after it a Fomentation, Cataplaſm, and Bag-Truſs. The next morning I fomented the Part again, and, placing him in a convenient poſture, reduced the Rupture; then ſhaved the Hair, and applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> with a Compreſs made of brown Paper which had been all night ſoaked in an aſtringent Decoction, and faſtened thereon a Boulſter-Truſs, with a Bag fitted to it, for to bear up the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> that, in caſe the Rupture ſhould ſlip down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet it ſhould meet with a check. Having thus by Bandage truſſed it up, I adviſed him to keep his bed ſome days, at leaſt till the Excoriations which the Steel-Truſs had made in his Hips were cured. During which his Diet was ſlender, and his body kept ſoluble by lenient <hi>Bolus's,</hi> and conſolidating
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95669:88"/>Drinks were preſcribed him. He was one that had no great imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ſo was perſwaded to keep his bed the longer; during which the lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Parts did unite, and he was cured.</p>
                     <p>One Summer, whilſt I attended the King at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">16. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis.</hi>
                        </note> an Officer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Larder, a man of above ſixty years of age, having been long afflicted with a <hi>Hernia inteſtinalis,</hi> which frequently ſlipt into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> had it then fallen down paſt his skill of Reduction. I, finding him vomiting and in a Fever, endeavoured by warm cloaths to reduce it, but could not. I therefore preſently cauſed a Clyſter to be given him of fat Broth with a little Salt in it, and applied a Fomentation made of the ſame Broth, and at length, putting him in a declining poſture, I reduced the Rupture, and put on his Truſs with a Compreſs under the Boulſter; by which I retained the Rupture up. I would have preſcribed him other helps, but he was ſatisfied that it was reduced. After two or three days he went abroad again, and, for ought I know, is yet alive.</p>
                     <p>A perſon having been long afflicted with a <hi>Hernia</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">17. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                        </note> through ill fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Truſſes had it much increaſed, till at length he threw them off, as not onely uſeleſs, but painfull to him. The Rupture was ſo large, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines did their office in the <hi>Scrotum</hi> without Reduction. But the weight of them was uneaſy, and often accompanied with Colicks, and would by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees have proceeded to worſe inconvenience. I helped it by the palliative way of a Bag-Truſs, with a perforation for his <hi>Penis.</hi> This ſuſtained the weight, and enabled him to follow his occaſions without farther trouble.</p>
                     <p>In ſome people I have ſeen the Ruptures ſo great that they have not been able to goe; yet not any of them would admit of the moſt probable of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Operations, but contented themſelves with ſuch accommodation as a Bag-Truſs would afford them.</p>
                     <p>A young Woman, after hard Labour, had a Rupture in her left Groin.<note place="margin">18. Obſervat.</note> I ſupplied her with a Boulſter-Truſs with one Strap and Emplaſter, by which ſhe was cured, or at leaſt palliated. In others, where they have not timely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, whether through ignorance or ſhame, they have increaſed to a greater bigneſs, and have made in progreſs of time ſuch a ſwagging Tumour as became extreamly troubleſome to truſs up.</p>
                     <p>One of about thirty years of age, of a groſs fat Body,<note place="margin">19. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia umbilicalis.</hi>
                        </note> laboured of a <hi>Hernia umbilicalis</hi> about the breadth of the palm of a hand. He had worn the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Navell-Truſſes; but they, not ſitting ſteady upon the diſeaſed Part, pinched him ſometimes in one place, ſometimes in another, and did not retain the Rupture. I being adviſed with, and conſidering his Belly very great, and likely to ſuffer greater Ruptions, if the weight of it were not timely born up, perſwaded him to permit a Bracer to be made to lace in his whole Belly, under which a Boulſter might be placed on the Navell. I took meaſure of it, and fitted him with ſuch a one as reached from the <hi>Pubes</hi> to the <hi>Cartilago enſiformis,</hi> and laced behind. Under this I applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> with a quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Boulſter, which was worked upon Sole-leather: this was tacked to the Bracer. In ſome others I have made a Bandage over that Bracer; but here it was needleſs.</p>
                     <p>One had three <hi>Herniae</hi> beſides that of the Navell, <hi>viz.</hi> one in each Groin,<note place="margin">20. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia.</hi>
                        </note> whereof the one deſcended <hi>in Scrotum,</hi> and the other not; the third lay on the left ſide of his Belly, raiſing up a Tumour under the Skin like half an Apple. The <hi>Herniae in Inguinibus</hi> were kept up by a Steel-Truſs with a double Boulſter; to which a Bag was tucked to retain the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> To that on the ſide of the Belly was applied an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam,</hi> with a Compreſs in the middle of it, made of ſome folds of the ſame Emplaſter, and a quilted Boulſter over

To the Navell there was an <hi>Emplaſtr. ad herniam</hi> applied, and ſuch a like Boulſter as was uſed in the like caſe in the former Obſervation of a <hi>Hernia um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicalis:</hi> and, to retain theſe cloſe, a Bracer was fitted to the Belly with Straps, which went from the lower part of it between the Legs, and faſtned behind, where the Bracer was laced. This perſon being fat was alſo gauled between the wrinkles of his Belly, which was for ſome time dreſſed daily with Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of quality,<note place="margin">21. Obſervat. of <hi>Hernia umbilicalis.</hi>
                        </note> of a full Body, having been ſometime ſubject to a <hi>Hernia umbilicalis,</hi> which through defect in Bandage increaſed much, ſo that the Skin was excoriated by the unequall ſitting of the quilted Boulſter, I was conſulted. The Rupture in the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> was great, and the <hi>Omentum</hi> and Inteſtines had made their way out to the externall Skin of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> ſo that between them and the Boulſter it was worn very thin. The Excoriation was dreſt with Epuloticks, as <hi>unguent.tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. and a ſoft Compreſs applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Quilt and Emplaſter. A Belly-piece was made to bear the weight, and retain the Compreſſion. After this was cured, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was adviſed with. He made a Boulſter with a Bracer to ſit under the Belly-piece, which retained the Rupture, and the Patient went abroad daily. But one day, whilſt he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his affairs, the Boulſter ſlipt off, and the Inteſtines ſtarted out between the Muſcle and external Skin, ſo that he was brought to his Lodgings very ill. Phyſicians were conſulted, and I was ſent for, and reduced it with a warm cloath in their preſence, and an Emplaſter and Bracer were put on. From which time he hath not been ſo ſubject to a Relapſe.</p>

                     <p>The accidentall Differences are taken from thoſe things which are not intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall to the nature or conſtitution of an Ulcer; as, to have Inflammation, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Putrefaction joyned with them, as <hi>Phlegmon, Eryſipelas, Cancer, Gangrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Callus, Varix,</hi> or <hi>Caries:</hi> Alſo from the Symptoms; ſome Ulcers are painfull
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95669:91"/>with Pulſation, and pricking burning heat, others with itching and Excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: From the quality; Ulcers are malign, benign, contagious, or not; rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, or eaſie of Cure: Alſo from the age of the Ulcer; ſome are recent, others annuall; alſo ſome in their ſtate, others in their declination, onely requiring Deſiccation.</p>
                     <p>From theſe fountains the Differences and Diſtinctions of Ulcers do ariſe; the methodizing of which hath already pozed able Writers: we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put them into ſuch order as ſhall be moſt plain to the young Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p>Therefore firſt we ſhall ſpeak of Ulcers in generall: 2. of a Simple Ulcer: 3. of Ulcers with <hi>Intemperies:</hi> 4. of Ulcers with Pain: 5. of Fluxion: 6. of Ulcers with <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> or ſuperfluous Fleſh: 7. of Ulcers with <hi>Caries:</hi> 8. of Sordid Ulcers: 9. of Callous Ulcers: 10. of Ulcers called <hi>Phagedaena</hi> and <hi>Dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epulota:</hi> 11. of Ulcers with <hi>Varix:</hi> and, laſtly, of Sinuous Ulcers. I ſhould alſo treat of Fiſtulous Ulcers from <hi>Gangraena</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus;</hi> but they have been heretofore occaſionally put into the Treatiſe of <hi>Wounds,</hi> to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin with Ulcers in generall,<note place="margin">Cauſes of Ulcers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> and treat firſt of their <hi>Cauſes;</hi> of which ſome are internall, others externall: both are (if we ſpeak of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſes) corroding Humours, which eat away the Fleſh, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this corroſive quality arrive from Internall Cauſes, it oweth its Originall to the exceſs of an acrid <hi>Serum:</hi> which <hi>Serum</hi> if it mixeth with any other Humour, whether Choler, Phegm, Bloud, Melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gets a denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from that.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Humours, when they abound ſo far in the Body as to exceed that Temperament <hi>ad juſtitiam</hi> which is always neceſſary to health, (to which Temperament a latitude muſt be allowed,) are apt to ſeparate from the whole Maſs, and flow either quite out of the Body by natural Excretions, or elſe upon ſome Members of it; whether they be carried thither by their own ſource, or drawn by ſome attractive cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Being ſo caſt out from the Maſs of bloud, they are no longer ſubject to the Balſam of that, but become acrimonious and corroſive: and by how much the longer the Humour hath been extravaſated, by ſo much the more acrid it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and is the more corroding; acquiring in its degeneration a quality ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Humour out of which it is engendred.</p>
                     <p>The External Cauſes are Poiſons, corroſive and cauſticall Medicaments. Nor do we exclude actuall Fire, Hot water, ſcalding Oyl: to which may be referred the Contagions of Scabby, Leprous and Pocky perſons, which are communicated to the Skin, and exulcerate it, and beget the like Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>From theſe diverſities of Cauſes different ſorts of Excrements flow: three forts whereof give name to Ulcers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The one is a thin ſerous Humour, called <hi>Sanies,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks Ichor;</hi> by others <hi>Virus,</hi> from whence they are called <hi>virulent. Celſus</hi> reckoneth two ſorts of <hi>Sanies;</hi> the one he calleth <hi>Ichor,</hi> and the other <hi>Meliceria.</hi> They are taken notice of by <hi>Fabricius Hildanus.</hi> The <hi>Ichor</hi> is a thin whitiſh Gleet incident to ill-diſpoſed Ulcers, eſpecially amongſt the Nerves and Tendons. The <hi>Melice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is a thick glutinous Humour of a pale colour, and it may be yellowiſh, not unlike Honey, from whence it taketh its name. This alſo affects Ulcers of ill condition near and in the Joynts, where the Membranes and Tendons are eroded. But that which we generally in our common Chirurgery call <hi>Sanies</hi> is, a thin excrementitious Humour begotten from abundance of ſeroſity in Ulcers, and rendering them humid. Of which Humours ſome are hot and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95669:91"/>reddiſh-coloured, others cold and pale-coloured. Theſe are called <hi>Sanious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond ſort of Matter affecting Ulcers that is thick, generated of abundance of groſs tough Humours, and rendering the Ulcer foul; whence it is called a <hi>Sordid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi> This kind of <hi>Sordes</hi> differeth as it is white or grayiſh, though unequally coagulated, or elſe as it is blackiſh and foetid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third ſort of Matter is of a middle conſiſtence between thick and thin; ſometimes of a greeniſh or yellowiſh colour, and then it hath a rank ſmell; but for the moſt part it is of a white colour, and is called <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter. And this is ſuppoſed to proceed from a benign <hi>Serum</hi> flowing to the Part affected for its nutriment; which, by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Part, is not aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but converted into a whitiſh ſubſtance, and giveth the name of a <hi>Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Differences of Excrement in a Sore are beſt underſtood by conſidering the Cauſes of their generation. For if the nutritious <hi>Serum</hi> be well conditioned, and the Part not affected with Wound, Tumour, or other preternaturall weakneſs, it is by Nature converted into nouriſhment: but if there be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity, then ſhe, failing of her firſt intention, acteth according to her ability, and according to the quality of the <hi>Serum.</hi> If the Conſtitution be good, and the <hi>Serum</hi> well-conditioned, then we find a laudable <hi>Pus</hi> to ariſe, which is white, ſmooth, and eaſy to the Part, and every day approacheth nearer and nearer to the true nutritious Juice, till by degrees the Ulcer fills up with Fleſh and heals. But if it degenerate towards a ſharp virulent <hi>Serum,</hi> then the Ulcer appeareth full of a thin <hi>Ichor</hi> or <hi>Sanies,</hi> Nature's Balſam being weak, and her heat inſufficient for a due concoction of the Matter. If the Bloud grow phlegmatick, its <hi>Serum</hi> is ſo too, and groweth groſs and ſlimy, and wanting heat, doth corrupt into a thick glutinous Matter, which we call <hi>Sordes;</hi> and ſometimes a ſtinking Matter, which makes a <hi>Putrid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Ulcer, if it be in the outward Parts, is diſcoverable by the ſight.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> If it be inward, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Ventricle, Guts, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus, Kidneyes,</hi> &amp;c. it muſt be gueſſed at by the Excrements that come from it, and other Symptoms. The greatneſs and littleneſs is likewiſe diſtinguiſhable by the eye, if it be in the Superficies. But Ulcers that are deep require farther ſearch of Probes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, if inward, muſt be preſumed proportionable to the quantity of the Matter that floweth from them. Equality and Inequality are alſo judged by the view; ſo Sinuoſity and <hi>Caries</hi> by Probing.</p>
                     <p>Sanious Ulcers are known by the undigeſted <hi>Serum</hi> that gleets from them: and if the Gleet be corroſive, we find the fleſh waſte apace. If that Eroſion be with jagged and callous Lips, it is <hi>Phagedaena,</hi> or at leaſt virulent. If the Matter iſſuing out be ſlimy and groſs, it is a ſordid; if foetid and corrupt, it is a putrid Ulcer. If it be onely ſuperficially corroſive and ſpreading, it is a <hi>Herpes exedens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The nearneſs of a Nerve, Tendon or Ligament, is beſt underſtood by the pain, which is commonly acute. If a Nerve ly near, and cauſe pain, it is apt to contract the Lim, or cauſe Convulſion. An Artery if near, is diſcovered by Pulſation.</p>
                     <p>To make a right <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> in the Cure of Ulcers,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> we ought firſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe, and what ſtrength the Patient hath to overcome it: for if that be deficient, our endeavours to cure them will prove vain.</p>
                     <p>The greatneſs of the Diſeaſe is known, either by the quality of the Part affected, or by the depth or other conditions of the Ulcer.</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:95669:92"/>
                     <p>As to the quality of the Part: Thoſe in the Skin are not dangerous, nor difficult of Cure, but as they are accompanied with <hi>Intemperies.</hi> Ulcers in the Emunctories, by reaſon of the great Veſſells, may be dangerous, and through moiſture of the place are difficult of Cure. Thoſe near any principall Part are not without danger, for that by their penetration the neighbouring <hi>Viſcera</hi> may ſuffer. Ulcers in the Muſcles of the Spine of the back and in great Joynts are of great danger and hard Cure: amongſt the Tendons and Bones of the Hands and Feet they are painfull, by reaſon of their exquiſite ſenſe, and of difficult Cure.</p>
                     <p>The depth and largeneſs of the Ulcer makes the Cure hazardous: for in great and wide Ulcers the native heat is much weakned; and if they penetrate under any great Artery, Nerve or Tendon, that you cannot ſafely lay them open, the Cure muſt needs be ſlow, and the great diſcharge of Matter may exhauſt the Spirits of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The Condition of the Ulcer is of great moment in Prognoſtick: where we are to conſider both the quantity and the quality of the Humour flowing to it. If it be in a depending Part, and the Body plethorick, the very multitude of Humours (though otherwiſe not bad) is a ſufficient impediment of a Cure: ſo alſo if the quality be amiſs, though the quantity be not great. For when the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is accompanied with a dry <hi>Intemperies,</hi> it frequently eludes your Medicines. The caſe is as bad when Ulcers have continued ſo long as to bring an habituall Dyſcraſy upon the Part: as we ſee in the <hi>Nomae</hi> and annuall Ulcers, which are either not cured at all, or with danger to the life of the Patient. A degree beyond theſe are the Phagedaenicall Ulcers, and worſt of all the Cancerous and Sphacelous: of all which in their due places.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of Ulcers in generall,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> we ſhall conſider the Ulcer firſt as it is ſimple, with Solution of continuity and Eroſion; then as it is compounded, and hath other Symptoms or Indiſpoſition joyned with it.</p>
                     <p>The Simple Ulcer, as it conſiſteth in a Solution of continuity, requireth Union; and as it hath loſt of ſubſtance, Reſtauration: and this is effected by Exſiccation; for ſo long as the Ulcer continueth ſanious or ſordid, it cannot heal: therefore in ſuch caſes Digeſtion or Deterſion are required.</p>
                     <p>The loſs of ſubſtance is either of Skin or Fleſh. If onely the Skin be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Fleſh is ſo to be dried with Medicaments, as the Juices coming thither may be hardened into a callous ſubſtance reſembling Skin; for that it is a ſpermatick Part, and cannot be regenerated. If the Fleſh be wanting, it muſt be renewed: which work is performed by the benefit of Nature out of a part of that bloud which was deſigned for the nouriſhment of that Member. But foraſmuch as in the generation of Fleſh in an Ulcer there is a twofold Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeparated, the one thin, the other thick; the thin, as I ſaid, requireth to be dried up, and the thick to be deterged.</p>
                     <p>But in the Cure of Compound Ulcers many Indications are requiſite, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of Cauſes and Symptoms which attend them. In the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Medicaments to thoſe Ulcers you ought to conſider their beginning, augment, ſtate, and declination. In the beginning the <hi>Sanies</hi> is crude and wateriſh, and requireth the benefit of Concoction, whereby it may be made thicker, and turned into good Matter; in which caſe Suppuratives are of uſe: which is not allowable in putrid Ulcers, for in that caſe they increaſe Putrefaction; and in purulent ones alſo they render the Ulcer more lax, and at length ſordid. If the indiſpoſition of the Ulcer be cauſed meerly by the pain, Suppuratives are convenient; for by their digeſtive and lenient quality they mitigate the pain, and thereby remove the Cauſe: which Suppuratives are to be continued till the Matter be well concocted. And for this reaſon it is we uſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95669:92"/>them in the beginning, leſt the extravaſated Humours ſhould corrupt, and ſtir up pain and Inflammation. In the Augment, when the Matter is leſs in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and thicker, we uſe Detergents to cleanſe it. In the State, when the Ulcer is well cleanſed, it may be reaſonble to uſe Sarcoticks: and in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, as the Ulcer fills with Fleſh, we do our endeavours by Epuloticks to cicatrize it.</p>
                     <p>But if the Ulcer labour under any Diſtemper of Symptome, whether it be internall or externall, as Influx of ſharp corroſive Humours, whether they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the whole Habit of body, or affect onely the Part it ſelf; they are all to be removed before you can hope for Cure. The conſideration of which indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many Intentions: we ſhall reduce them to four heads. The firſt ſhall be of a regulation in Diet and the other Non-naturalls: the ſecond of Evacuation, Revulſion, and Derivation of the antecedent Matter: the third ſhall have a regard to the Part in which the Ulcer is ſeated, to ſtrengthen it againſt the Influx: and the fourth and laſt treateth of a due application of Medicines to the Ulcer it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſatisfie the Firſt Intention, their Diet ſhall be proportioned to the ſtrength of the Patient, according as the Humours are peccant in quantity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and abound in the whole Body, or in ſome particular Part; that their heat and acrimony may be contemperated. To which purpoſe there is regard to be had that the Air be good, and their Exerciſe, Paſſions of the mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, according as hath been ſaid, in the former Treatiſe, of <hi>Tumours in generall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second Intention conſiſteth of Evacuation, Revulſion, and Derivation of the Humours. If they abound in quantity, or offend through their evill quality, it may be made either by Bleeding, if their ſtrength permit, and other things be conſentaneous, which alſo makes Revulſion; or by Purging or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.</p>
                     <p>Derivation is always made in the remote Parts, and according to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Veſſells, either by opening a Vein by Lancet, or by the application of Leeches, Cupping-glaſſes, Bliſtering-plaiſters, Friction, Binding <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which I refer you to the Treatiſe of <hi>Tumours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Intention hath regard to the weakneſs and <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Part affected: to which purpoſe the Humours may be intercepted in their courſe by the application of aſtringent and repellent Medicaments on the ſound Parts above the Ulcer, in the nature of Defenſatives. If the Member be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the raiſing of it up, and placing it equall with or higher then the reſt of the Body, may be of great advantage: the Influx may alſo be reſtrained, and the Part ſtrengthened by expulſive Bandage. We may alſo by Alteratives correct their acrimony, and, if the Humours be too ſerous, incraſſate them, or, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they offend, rectify them by their contraries. How farther to reſiſt the various Symptoms attending Ulcers ſhall be ſet down in the particular Cure of each ſeverall Species.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Fourth Intention is in curing the Ulcer it ſelf; which is, as I have already ſaid, by drying up the excrementitious ſerous Humour, and deterging the more groſs. The Medicaments proper thereto, with the method in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them, ſhall be treated of in the particular Cure of each Ulcer, to which I haſten.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of a Simple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Simple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer</hi> is a Solution of Continuity with Eroſion,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> having no other Symptome or remarkable Affection joyned with it. Of theſe Authours make two kinds;<note place="margin">Kinds.</note> the one onely with Skin off, and the other with the loſs of Skin and ſome part of the Fleſh. As they call the firſt <hi>planum</hi> or equall, ſo they call this latter <hi>cavum.</hi> The former is inconſiderable: the Cure of the latter I ſhall here deliver.</p>
                     <p>In the doing of which two things offer themſelves:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> the one is the generation of Fleſh, to fill up that Cavity; and the other is the making a <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> to unite the ſeparated Lips of the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>To the proſecution of the firſt Intention, in reſtoring the loſt Fleſh, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Part affected be free from diſtemper: for the generation of Fleſh is the work of Nature, and her ſtrength conſiſts in the juſt temperament of the Part; which being ſo, our endeavour ought to be, that the <hi>Succus nutritius,</hi> whereof the Fleſh is generated, be good, and that it flow moderately into the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. To which purpoſe a good Diet muſt here alſo be obſerved, with a regulation of the Non-naturalls; that the Air be temperate, Exerciſe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and in ſome caſes none at all. In Sleeping and watching a mediocrity ought to be obſerved; naturall Evacuations are to be continued, and the Quiet of the mind to be preſerved. If theſe things be duly obſerved, and the tone of the ulcerated Part preſerved by the moderate inflowing of good Juices, and the Matter in the Ulcer well digeſted, it is then capable of being healed: but if the Ulcer be too dry, moiſt, or crude and undigeſted, it cannot incarn. Therefore it behoves that we conſider the temper of the Part ulcerated, and the Excrements flowing thereout, and thence take indication whether to uſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puratives or Detergents, and when Sarcoticks are convenient, or one more then another. Suppuratives ought to be of a lenient quality, temperately hot and moiſt, proportioned to the Habit of body, as it is weak or ſtrong, and to the temper of the Part they are to be applied unto. The common Digeſtive is <hi>terebinthina</hi> in tender bodies, with <hi>far. tritici,</hi> a little <hi>crocus pulv. cum vitell. ovi.</hi> In drier bodies we adde <hi>far. hordei, fabar. colophon. thus, pulv. ſem. foenugraeci:</hi> to which we ſometimes adde <hi>mel roſat. &amp; ſyr. de roſ. ſicc. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent. baſilicon</hi> is not inferiour to any. Theſe Medicaments ought to be of a moderate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence: not too liquid, leſt they make the Fleſh too lax, or run off the Pledgits, and leave them uneaſy to the Soar. For the ſame reaſon your Medicaments are not to be of too hard a conſiſtence. The deeper Ulcers may admit of the more liquid, that they may reach to the bottome. They are to be uſed upon Lint in the form of Pledgits, Doſſills, or Tents; and over them may be applied Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerants, to contemperate the heat of the Part, and reſiſt the Fluxion.</p>
                     <p>Suppuratives are of no longer uſe then till the Matter be well digeſted; for through the too long uſe of them the Ulcer may be made ſordid: therefore when the Matter appears well digeſted, we mix Detergents with them, to cleanſe the Ulcer. Of the milder ſort is this: ℞ <hi>terebinth. lot. in aq. acetoſ.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>ſucc. apii</hi> ℥vj. <hi>coq. ad conſumpt. ſucci, deinde adde vitell. unius ovi.</hi> Such is <hi>mundif. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſi.</hi> In theſe kind of Ulcers I have frequently digeſted, deterged and incarned by the uſe of <hi>Merc. praecipit.</hi> mixt with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> more or leſs. The Ulcer deterged, (which you may know by the good condition of the Matter, together with the ruddy colour and firmneſs of Fleſh,) you may then proceed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95669:93"/>by Sarcoticks. In the uſe of which you are to remember, that in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Fleſh two ſorts of Excrements ariſe, the one thin, called <hi>Sanies,</hi> the other thick, diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Sordes.</hi> How they diſturb the Ulcer in its healing, I have elſewhere told you, and now adviſe you that you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temper of the Part, and what Senſe it hath, and fit Sarcoticks according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moderately to dry and cleanſe; leſt through errour therein by over-drying you conſume the Fleſh you deſigned to raiſe, or by too moiſt Applications ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it corrupt. The ſeaſon of the year is herein to be obſerved: for in the hotter ſeaſon Medicaments more cooling are required, and in cold weather more heating. Therefore at ſuch times we put thicker Compreſs, and take more turns with our Rowls, then in hot weather. The Habit of body is alſo to be regarded. For in lax and tender Bodies Sarcoticks require to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately drying, ſuch as are <hi>olibanum, thus, aloe, cort. thuris, far. foenugraeci, orobi,</hi> &amp;c. The Compounds are, <hi>unguent. matriſylv.</hi> or <hi>baſilicon magn. diapom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholyg. unguent. tutiae, calaminaris:</hi> or this, ℞ <hi>myrrhae, aloes, an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>thuris</hi> ℥j. <hi>maſtich.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>gum. elemi</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iij. <hi>terebinth. Venet.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>ol. hyperici q. ſ. fiat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> The more drying are, <hi>rad. ireos, ariſtoloch. rot. far. lupinor. ſarcocoll. aſa foetida</hi> made up with <hi>mel deſpumat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If theſe Medicaments be well proportioned to the nature of the Ulcer, the Matter will appear of good colour and conſiſtence, and in leſs quantity, and the Fleſh of a natural colour, firm, and drawing into a healing condition. But if the Medicaments were too drying, the Fleſh in the Ulcer will be pale, the Matter thin, and the Parts about heated with the diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>The Ulcer incarned, you are to endeavour to cicatrize it by drying the Fleſh into <hi>Callus:</hi> and foraſmuch as <hi>Callus</hi> is drier and harder then Fleſh, therefore your Medicaments ought to be more drying then thoſe you incarned with, and to be endued with an aſtringent Quality.</p>
                     <p>The making of this <hi>Callus</hi> is the work of Nature, yet is furthered by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Medicaments, (as I have ſaid.) If the temperament of the Part be well diſpoſed, you may obſerve the Ulcer to skin from the edges while it is filling with Fleſh within, and without the help of Epuloticks: but where the Part hath been long affected with Ulceration, it is uſually weak and out of temper, and is very difficult to cicatrize; therefore it requires Epuloticks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly more drying and aſtringent.</p>
                     <p>The milder cicatrizing Simples are, <hi>bolus Armen. ſang. dracon. creta, pulv. oſtreorum combuſt. roſ. rub. balauſt. ſumach, calx lota, ceruſſa, plumb. uſtum, tutia.</hi> A mixture of ſome of theſe may be ſprinkled upon the Ulcer, or a Decoction of them applied upon Lint. The ſtronger are, <hi>ſacchar. Saturni, vitriol. Rom. aes uſt. ſquamae aeris, ferri, croc. Martis aſtringens.</hi> Theſe Powders may be mixed with Unguents. Or, ℞ <hi>unguent. calaminaris, Emplaſtr. griſei, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>liniment. Arcaei</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ſacchar. Saturn.</hi> ℈ j. <hi>cerae q. ſ. fiat Emplaſtrum.</hi> Or ſome of the aboveſaid Powders may be decocted or diſſolved in proper Waters, and applied upon Lint, taking care that you do not by the uſe of them conſume the Fleſh, in ſtead of condenſing it into Skin.</p>
                     <p>The time of applying Epuloticks is, when the Fleſh is riſing up near the Lips of the Ulcer, (before it grow too high) that it may be dried to cicatrize even with it; for Nature is not wanting the while to incarn. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you defer the uſe of Epuloticks till the Fleſh be grown equall with the Skin, you will be forced to uſe Eſcaroticks, or make an unſeemly <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrix:</hi> to avoid which we generally apply Epuloticks to the edges while we are incarning the middle. For by the way you muſt take notice, that none but ill-conditioned Ulcers begin to cicatrize from the middle. If the Lips of the Ulcer lie not levell with the Ulcer, it will not eaſily cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95669:94"/>therefore in ſuch caſe you muſt make a more ſtrict Compreſſion by Bandage.</p>
                     <p>AMongſt the various and ſundry ſorts of Ulcers that happen daily under my Cure, I find it difficult to make out one Simple Ulcer, as Authours have deſcribed it to us, without other Symptom or Affects joyned to it; every Ulcer having ſomewhat of diſtemper till it be digeſted and brought into a healing condition. In which regard we ſhall call that a Simple Ulcer which hath feweſt Accidents attending it, and ſhall give you an Inſtance of one in a Gentleman,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a Simple Ulcer.</note> who having a ſmall incomſiderable Puſh riſen upon one of his Legs on the outſide, he not taking notice of its mattering, it adhered to his Stocking, and became ulcerated in the Skin, with a ſmall Inflammation and Swelling. I dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> upon a Pledgit of Lint, applying <hi>Emplaſtr. oxelaei</hi> with a ſoft Compreſs lf linen over it, and rowled it up from the Small of the leg to the Gartering, adviſing him to favour his Leg what he could, by laying it ſometimes upon a Stool. Thus in two or three days it was digeſted, and freed of the Inflammation and Swelling. From that time I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. tutiae Vigon.</hi> by which I cicatrized the Ulcer to the compaſs of a ſilver Half-peny. The Patient ſuppoſing himſelf cured left off the uſe of the Bandage, and gave himſelf the liberty to walk abroad: upon which the Lips of the Ulcer grew high, and became inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of cicatrizing that way. I therefore made a Paſte of Ceruſe with <hi>unguent. roſat.</hi> which with Compreſs and Bandage preſſed the Lips even with the Ulcer, and cicatrized it in three or four days, whilſt he was attending his affairs at home.</p>
                     <p>Such another was commended to my hands by Doctour <hi>Weatherly.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Simple Ulcer.</note> The Ulcer was in the Leg, and had been very vexatious to the Patient: it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome little Fluxion, enough to relax the Parts, and keep the Ulcer from digeſting, and conſequently from healing. I dreſſed it as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obſervation hath been ſaid; onely in ſtead of a Rowler I put on a laced Stocking: by the wearing of which the Humours were reſtrained, and the Patient cured himſelf in few days by the Unguents forememtioned.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with</hi> Intemperies.</head>
                     <p>IT frequently happens that Ulcers are ſubject to various complicated Affects: Therefore the Cure muſt neceſſarily vary accordingly. For which cauſe we ſhall now treat of Ulcers as they have Symptoms or Diſeaſes joyned with them; and begin with thoſe that labour under <hi>Intemperies,</hi> whether from corrupt Juices in the whole Body, or Imbecillity in ſome particular Part. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, that Cauſe muſt be firſt removed, before you can hope to make good Digeſtion in order to the incarning or cicatrizing of the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Intemperies</hi> is ſimple, or compound. The Simple are four, hot, cold, moiſt,<note place="margin">Kinds.</note> and dry: the Compound are, hot and moiſt, hot and dry, cold and moiſt, cold and dry. We ſhall begin our Diſcourſe with the Hot <hi>Intemperies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> may ariſe from a Fermentation of the <hi>Serum</hi> in the bloud,<note place="margin">Hot <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                        </note> and that from ill Habit of body, ill Diet, or the like; alſo from heat of the Air, or keeping the Part affected too hot, by lapping too many Cloaths or Rowlers upon it, or by reaſon of too ſtrict Bandage, or by the application of too ſharp Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>A cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> is cauſed by abundance of pituitous Humours,<note place="margin">Cold <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.</hi>
                        </note> or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Ulcer too much to the air in the time of dreſſing, or by the not enough defending it in cold weather by good Compreſſes and Bandage, or through the application of Medicaments too cooling.</p>
                     <p>A dry <hi>Intemperies</hi> may be occaſioned by the exhauſting of the naturall heat,<note place="margin">Dry <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                        </note> as in long chronick Diſeaſes, Hecticall indiſpoſitions, or by too ſlender Diet, or the like; alſo through defect of Aliment in the Part it ſelf for want of uſe, as it frequently happens where Ulcers have long affected the Member.</p>
                     <p>A moiſt <hi>Intemperies</hi> may proceed from abundance of Humours in the body,<note place="margin">Moiſt <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.</hi>
                        </note> and Imbecillity of the Part affected from hard Bandage or too ſlabby Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or poſſibly want of Bandage. Wet and foggy weather is frequently a cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Intemperies</hi> be hot, the Ulcer and Parts about it are red,<note place="margin">Signs of hot.</note> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient complains of heat in the Ulcer. Alſo the Matter is ſharp, whence a pricking and burning is frequently felt, and ſometimes an itching in the Part. The Cauſe preceding will ſhew the nature of the <hi>Intemperies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſorts of Ulcers are relieved with cooling Medicaments, and exaſperated by thoſe that heat.</p>
                     <p>The cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed by the livid or pale colour of the Ulcer and Parts about it; the Fleſh in the Ulcer is whitiſh and looſe;<note place="margin">Signs of cold</note> the Patient alſo complains of cold. It finds relief by Medicaments that are heating.</p>
                     <p>A moiſt <hi>Intemperies</hi> may be judged by the too much humidity in the Ulcer:<note place="margin">Signs of moiſt.</note> and if that Humour be not acrimonious, the Fleſh will be luxurious and flaccid. The great diſcharge of excrementitious Humours and the Habit of body will evidently diſcover the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>A dry <hi>Intemperies</hi> is for the moſt part judged by the Habit of the body,<note place="margin">Signs of dry.</note> it being lean and dry; the Member or Part diſeaſed is alſo dry and ſqualid, the Lips thin and lank, and with little moiſture.</p>
                     <p>By the Signs of theſe Simple <hi>Intemperies</hi> the Compound may be judged of.</p>
                     <p>As all Ulcers complicated with great Diſeaſes are of difficult Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and therefore called Cacoethe: ſo theſe Ulcers labouring under <hi>Intemperies,</hi> though they be well handled, are hard of Cure, and may be truly reckoned among
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95669:95"/>the Cacoethe, malign and rebellious Ulcers. But thoſe accompanied with Siccity are the worſt; for that we are neceſſitated to neglect the Cure of the Ulcer, to ſuccour the Part affected. The Cure is alſo long in effecting, by reaſon that the whole Habit of body requires by Humectation to be altered, which is a work of time: whereas the Ulcer diſtempered with heat, cold, or moiſture, may be cured while you are removing the <hi>Intemperies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Ulcers conſiſts in the removing of the <hi>Intemperies.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure of a hot <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.</hi>
                        </note> Therefore in the firſt place you are to conſider whether it be hot, cold, moiſt, or dry, and endeavour to reſtore the diſeaſed Part to its naturall temper by its contraries; as if it be hot, treat it with Refrigerants, to the moiſt apply Deſiccants, and ſo the reſt: having care the while that you do not neglect the Cure of the Ulcer. But if it be ſo that both may not be relieved at one and the ſame time, then you are to regard that which moſt requires your help. If the Ulcer be accompanied with a hot <hi>Intemperies,</hi> that muſt be firſt removed by Refrigerants of an aſtringent and repellent quality, milder or ſtronger accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the Diſtemper. Alſo a cooling and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening Diet is to be obſerved, with regulation of the Non-naturalls. If there be <hi>Plethora,</hi> Purging and Bleeding are neceſſary, as well for Evacuation as Revulſion. The Ulcer it ſelf requires detergent and exſiccant Remedies: But in conſideration that the hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> conſumes the humidity in the Ulcer, and renders it leſs moiſt, therefore theſe Ulcers are to be treated with the milder Driers, yet with regard to the greatneſs of the <hi>Intemperies,</hi> and the quantity of Matter the Ulcer diſcharges. The Topicks are <hi>unguent. diapom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phol. tutiae, album, unguent. è plumbo, è calce, baſilicon,</hi> with Praecipitate.</p>
                     <p>The externall Remedies to be applied over the Part affected, to abate the heat of the <hi>Intemperies,</hi> may be <hi>unguent. album camphorat.

                        </note> having laboured ſome months under an Ulcer on the inſide of his right Leg along the Shin-bone with much pain, ſent for me. The Part affected was diſtempered with great heat, and the Ulcer diſcharging a <hi>Sanies,</hi> endeavours had been uſed to digeſt it <hi>cum terebinth. &amp; vitell. ovi,</hi> and ſuch like, unſucceſsfully. I fomented the Ulcer and Parts about with Claret-wine, and dreſſed it with two parts of <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and one part of <hi>unguent. baſilicon maj.</hi> with Praecipitate. Upon the Lips of it I applied Pledgits ſpred with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> and an Emplaſter of ſome of the ſame <hi>diapomphol.</hi> over all, with Compreſs wrung out of the Wine, and rowled it up lightly, placing his Leg in bed as before. The next day I brought a Decoction of <hi>fol. plantag. ſummitat. rubi, equiſeti, flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt.</hi> to which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome Wine; and while it was heating I took off the Dreſſings, and found the heat ſomewhat allay'd, and the Ulcer well diſpoſed to Digeſtion. I ſtuped the Ulcer, dreſſing the Parts about with <hi>unguent. tutiae. mag. Vig.</hi> and rowled it up as before. By this method the hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> removed, and the Ulcer digeſted: after which by the help of <hi>unguent. deſiccativum</hi> and the Alume-ſtone I cicatrized it firm, to the ſatisfaction of the Patient and his Relations, leaving him again to the care of his Phyſicians Sir. <hi>Alex. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>Fr. P.</hi> by whoſe order I made him a Fontanell, and ſome while after put him on a laced Stocking.</p>

                     <p>IN the Cure of an Ulcer with a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> there is required an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in Diet and other Non-naturalls,<note place="margin">Cure of a cold <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries.</hi>

The Medicaments proper to dreſs the Ulcer ought to be drying and detergent. The degrees of theſe qualities muſt be taken from the diſtemper of the Ulcer and Part affected, as it is much or little; alſo from the Age of the Patient, and Seaſon of the year; and from the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the Ulcer.</p>

He endeavoured the curing it by healing Medicaments, but it was thereby the more exaſperated, and ſpred larger. I, obſerving the too moiſt <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Part, and the Matter cruſted about upon the ſound edges, bathed it with <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> dreſſed the Ulcerations with <hi>unguent. de lithargyr.</hi> and applied a Compreſs wrung out of the ſaid <hi>aq. calcis</hi> over that with good Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. After I had thus dreſſed him, I let him bloud in the Arm about ten ounces, and the next day purged him with half an ounce of <hi>Elect. caryocoſtin.</hi> But notwithſtanding theſe endeavours, I found in the taking off Dreſſings a great diſcharge of a hot ſerous Humour, which increaſed the Ulcerations much. I therefore cauſed a Fomentation to be made of ſome of the forementioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, to fortify the weak Part againſt the Influx, and to dry up the Ulcer, and applied my Pledgits, ſpred with Epuloticks, ſomewhat more diſtant one from another, that the thin Humour might get out between them; then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Compreſs ſpred with <hi>unguent. nutritum</hi> over all, rowled it up equally, repeated the Purgation, and ordered him each other night <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> vj. <hi>ſyr. de meconio in aq. papaveris rhoead.</hi> with a little <hi>aq. cinnamom. hordeat.</hi> Obſerving in taking off my Dreſſings, that the Matter would in ſpite of my endeavours be here and there ſhut in by the Pledgits which lay upon the edges of the Ulcerations, I ſprinkled them with <hi>pulv. lap. tutiae praeparat.</hi> and forbore the uſe of Pledgits there, ſuppoſing that way to give vent to the Matter, and at the ſame time to cicatrize them, and the while dreſſed the Ulcer with Pledgits preſſed out of a ſtiptick Decoction in ſome places, and in other with <hi>unguent. è plumbo.</hi> But I found on the next Dreſſings that the Powder cruſted upon the edges, and by retention of the Humour cauſed Eroſion underneath.

                        </note> you are to apply your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours more immediately to the removing the <hi>Intemperies,</hi> and content your ſelf the while in digeſting the Ulcer, and keeping it clean. You are here to conſider the Cauſe of the Drought; whether it were from defect of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the whole Body, or in ſome particular Part, or in both. If the firſt, then a good Diet muſt be directed of ſuch meats as are of eaſy and good nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this caſe Wine is allowed to be moderately drank. In the ſecond and third caſes, you are to endeavour that the aliment be attracted into the affected Part by putting it upon action, if it may conſiſt with the Cure of the Ulcer. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Friction, Pitch Emplaſters, Fomentations, Embrocations, Fontanells,

The Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are to be applied moderately warm, and the Member to be bathed till it looks red and begins to ſwell: then you are to deſiſt; for if the Member be longer fomented or chafed, you may diſſipate what you attracted. The Medicaments afterwards to be applied ought to be humecting, as a mixture of Water and Oil; alſo ſuch like Cerote may be applied: ℞ <hi>ſucc. biſmalvae &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietariae an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ol. amygdal. dulc.</hi> ℥vj. <hi>cerae albae q. ſ. fiat Ceratum.</hi>

                     <p>A Youth of about thirteen years of age was brought out of the Country,<note place="margin">Obſervat. of an Ulcer with dry <hi>Intemperies.</hi>
                        </note> and lodged near me. He laboured under ſeverall Ulcers in his right Leg, one eſpecially upon an <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> on the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> on the inſide near the Ancle. The Ulcer was large, and of an ovall figure, the Lips pale, dry and thin, the Matter little and ſanious, the Leg it ſelf emaciated and ſqualid; which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was by the weakneſs of the native heat from not uſing of the Lim. I cauſed his Leg to be bathed with warm water, and dreſſed the Ulcers with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and Praecipitate, applying a Cerote over all of a mixture of <hi>unguent. dialthaeae, ol. expedibus bovinis,</hi> and Wax; then rowled a ſoft Compreſs on it, to retain the Dreſſings on and keep it warm, and ordered his Diet as above ſaid. The leſſer Ulcers digeſted and cured by the ordinary Epuloticks; but the larger upon the <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> would not digeſt for three days together with any Medicaments: which gave me cauſe to ſuſpect the Bone under it to be carious, and that I ſhould be neceſſitated to lay it bare: but I could not by ſearch of my Probe feel it. I continued to nouriſh the Part by bathing it with emollient Decoctions and Embrocations, with <hi>ol. ex ped. bovinis,</hi> and gave the Patient liberty to uſe his Leg by ſetting his Foot on the ground; by which it ſwelled, and became more humid. After ſome while, when I ſaw the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Member alter, I ordered a laced Stocking to be put on, for that I could not with a Rowler make ſuch a Compreſſion ſo near the Ancle as I would, without cauſing a ſwelling in his Foot. I dreſſed it with Pledgits of Lint dipt in a Solution of Tincture of Vitriol <hi>in aq. rubi,</hi> and made the Compreſſion over it; by which method the Ulcer cured with a firm <hi>Cicatrix</hi> upon that <hi>Exoſtoſis.</hi> He went well cured out of my hands, and I ſuppoſe is well to this day. Theſe kind of Ulcers are frequently ſeen in Hecticall and emaciated Bodies and withered Lims.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with Pain.</head>
                     <p>PAin is alſo one of the Symptoms which interrupts the Cure of Ulcers, and affects the Part ſometime after the Ulcer is cured, whence various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents are ſtirred up, as Fever, Watching, and a Proſternation of ſpirits. Therefore it requireth our utmoſt endeavours ſpeedily to remove or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Pain are acrid ſharp Humours corroding the Ulcer,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Parts about; proceeding either from a repletion of evill Juices aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Body, or through miſapplication of Medicaments in Chirurgery, as not timely digeſting the Ulcer, or from too long uſe of Abſterſives.</p>
                     <p>The Complaint of the Patient will demonſtrate the Pain, and the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms will ſhew the Cauſe;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> whether it ariſe from want of Digeſtion or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Matter will teſtify.</p>
                     <p>The removing of the Pain requireth a right diſtinguiſhing of its originall Cauſe.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> The Habit of body is alſo to be conſidered, how it is fault: and accordingly as there is <hi>Plethora</hi> or <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> you ought to make Evacuation by Purging, or Bleeding, or both, and uſe contemperating Juleps, Opiats, and the like. Alſo the Patient's eating and drinking ought to be regulated proportionately.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things premiſed, you are to apply your ſpeedy endeavours to remove the Pain by proper Anodynes. If the Ulcer be ſanious, it wants Digeſtion; and that is furthered by ſuch Medicaments as have a temperate heat, as we have already ſhewed. The heat in the Parts about may be mitigated by Lenients, as is before ſaid in <hi>Tumours,</hi> and after in <hi>Wounds,</hi> or by ſuch like; as the Mucilages of <hi>ſem. cydon. pſyllii, althaea,</hi> extracted in <hi>decoct. malvar.</hi> and <hi>far. hordei, croc. &amp; vitell. ovi, axung. gallin. porcin.</hi> made into the form of a Cataplaſm, or with Wax into a Cerote, or <hi>ceratum Galeni,</hi> or that with <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon:</hi> if more cooling be required, <hi>unguent. nutritum, alb. camphorat. Emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain ariſe from hot acrid Humours fretting the Ulcer, it may be dreſſed with <hi>unguent. diapompholygos, or unguent. è plumbo, unguent. tutiae</hi> ſimply, or mixed with <hi>baſilicon,</hi> with a little Praecipitate, with Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> or red Wine, whereby the heat may be contemperated, and the Part ſtrengthened to reſiſt the Influx, by which the Cure of the Ulcer may happily be effected.</p>
                     <p>If the Pain be cauſed by a ſordid Matter ſticking to the bottom of the Ulcer, and hindering tranſpiration, you cannot remove the Pain without Deterſives; of which <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> is the beſt and mildeſt.</p>
                     <p>Pain is ſo familiar an attendant of Ulcers, as it is not eaſy to repreſent you any one without it: but in complicated Ulcers it may not poſſibly be ſo eaſy to diſtinguiſh its Cauſe, nor yet ſo directly to demonſtrate the way of relieving it, as in a Simple Ulcer, where there is no other Symptome joyned with it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which I ſuppoſe it may appear moſt conſpicuous in Fontanells, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have choſe to give you a few Inſtances of ſuch, but ſhall begin with one ariſing from an Accident.</p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:95669:97"/>
                     <p>A Perſon of about forty years of age, of a full and ſcorbuticall Body,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> by ſome accident broke her Shin, and endeavoured the curing of it: but it daily growing more painfull, and not to be endured, I was ſent for, and, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ulcer ſanious, propoſed Digeſtion as the onely way to remove the Pain. I dreſſed the Ulcer with two parts of the common Digeſtive <hi>ex tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binth.</hi> and one part of <hi>unguent. tutiae mag.</hi> ſpred upon a Pledgit. The Ulcer was of ſo exquiſite ſenſe, that it would ſcarce bear the Pledgit. I applied <hi>unguent. alb. camphorat.</hi> ſpred Emplaſter-wiſe, with a Compreſs of ſoft Linen over it, and rowled it up from the Foot to the Gartering lightly, a little to reſtrain the Influx. This method I continued three days, by which the Ulcer was pretty well digeſted, and leſs painfull; but the Leg was ſubject to Fluxion: and I doubted how it would cure ſo ſuddenly as was expected without the help of a more ſteady Bandage, meaning a laced Stocking. But ſhe replied, they had alway made her ſick. I then propoſed Purging. To which ſhe objected the want of convenience. I continued the dreſſing of the Ulcer as before, till it was digeſted well; then I dreſſed it with Pledgits dipt in <hi>aq. calcis</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the ends of the Ulcer, with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent tutiae</hi> in the middle, to cicatrize if from the end, and applied <hi>unguent deſiceativ. rub.</hi> over them as an Emplaſter, then rowled it up; by which it cicatrized in a few days. After the Patient ſaw her ſelf ſo ſuddenly cured, ſhe became well inclined to have a laced Stocking put upon that Leg, and, finding no inconvenience by it, beſpake ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the other, and returned well ſatisfied to her houſe in the Country.</p>
                     <p>Some months after this perſon being again in the Town was grievouſly pained with a Fontanell in her left Arm,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of Pain from <hi>Sordes.</hi>
                        </note> which ſhe had kept for the ſpace of eight years; but now, not being able to eaſe her ſelf by the uſuall method, ſhe threw out the two Peaſe, and endeavoured to cure it: but it became more painfull, and would not heal. I, being ſent for, obſerved the Ulcer to retain the form the Peaſe had given it, by reaſon of a grayiſh viſcid ſordid Matter that covered the bottome and ſides thereof. This hindered the Tranſpiration, and ſtirred up a great heat about and in the Ulcer: the Lips grew turgid with the anguiſh, and ſo painfull that ſhe could not endure the wiping the thin <hi>Ichor</hi> from it with a ſoft Rugin with her own hands.</p>
                     <p>This Ulcer required Deterſion, and the beſt Anodyne had been to have filled it with Praecipitate, and to have applied Lenients over it. But her complaints put me upon the dreſſing it with ſuch Medicaments as ſhe had leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, which were <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> with Praecipitate upon a Doſſill, which I laid in the Ulcer lightly with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> over the Lips, and <hi>unguent. album</hi> over all; ſhe faſtning a Cloath over it, according as it would bear. She then complained grievouſly of the pain ſhe felt by the Doſſill in the Ulcer, and was, as ſhe told me next morning, in a Fever all that night. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame Dreſſings, onely applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over all that Part near the Ulcer, which remitted the heat and pain thereabout; but the Ulcer was exceſſive painfull for the ſpace of two hours after dreſſing: yet the Lips of the Ulcer had caſt off part of the <hi>Sordes,</hi> and the Ulcer it ſelf looked better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three or four days Dreſſings. The Parts without were ſo well tempered, that ſhe could bear a Compreſs and Bandage: but the Pain in the Ulcer continued for ſome hours after dreſſing, and returning again in the evening, laſted a great part of the night. Upon which conſideration I deſired her to give me leave to dreſs it with Praecipitate, aſſuring her eaſe from it. She permitting me, I dipped my Doſſill in the Praecipitate, and ſprinkled ſome of it where the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was thickeſt. I then applied my Doſſill over it, and a Pledgit with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> over that, with Emplaſter and Bandage, as before, and reſolved not to open it again till the third day after; but was called the next morning
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95669:98"/>and informed by her ſelf, that ſhe had been much eaſier ſince the dreſſing: and indeed at the next dreſſing I found a Slough come away with the Dreſſings, which was the <hi>Sordes.</hi> I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and Praecipitate mixed as at firſt, with the other Applications and Bandage; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day after dreſſing it again, and finding it well digeſted, and free from Pain, I put an Orange-Pea in the Ulcer, and continued it as a Fontanell with much eaſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus in ſcorbutically-habited ill Bodies, abounding with <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> we frequently ſee theſe ſimple Ulcers afflicted with ſharp Humours, which corrode them, and render them painfull fordid Ulcers; which, if not timely relieved by Deterſives and Lenients, do terminate in putrefactive Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour of about thirty ſix years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of Pain from Putrefaction.</note> labouring under ſharp Humours, was ordered a Fontanell in her Thigh, which a Chirurgeon made, and fitted with an Orange-Pea. It grew very painfull; but the Patient, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it ſhould be ſo, endured it ſo long till ſhe could not ſtand with it. I was ſent for, and ſaw the Thigh much ſwelled and heated with the exceſſive Pain, and the Ulcer covered with a brown <hi>Sordes,</hi> and a quantity of a thin Gleet iſſuing from it. I threw out the Pea, fomented the affected Part and Ulcer with Wine, filled the Ulcer with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> with Pledgits over it, with <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over all, rowling it up, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing her to keep her Chamber and Pallet. The third day after I dreſſed her again: the Slough came in part away. I dreſſed it up again as before; and the third day after found the Ulcer digeſted. The Pain mitigated the firſt night, and the heat went off the next dreſſing. I healed this Fontanell in few days, and made her one in her Arm.</p>
                     <p>But in ſuch indiſpoſed Bodies Pain doth not affect the Ulcers onely, but the Parts alſo where they have been, after they are cured.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of about thirty five years of age,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> of a ſcorbutick Habit of body, had an Iſſue made in her left Arm, which was continued running many years; but at length, whether through negligence, or from ſome other reaſon, ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to dry up. The Winter following ſhe grew very much out of order by reaſon of a great complication of ill Symptoms, of which the moſt important was an intolerable pain in that Arm and place where her Iſſue had formerly been. After various courſes of Phyſick and externall applications, ſhe was in ſome meaſure relieved, and was pretty free all the following Summer: but in the Winter, <hi>viz.</hi> 1672. her pain returned with ſuch violence, as to afflict not onely the place of the Iſſue with ſuch pains, that ſhe likened it to the cutting off of the Arm, but it ſtretched it ſelf in a while after to the whole Arm, Shoulder, yea the very Side it ſelf; ſo that many Attempts being made, the Chirurgeons in the Country opened two Iſſues on each ſide of the ſeat of the old one. Many other things were done, till at laſt ſhe came into my hands. Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> was her Phyſician, and upon examination found her afflicted with a <hi>Rheumatiſmus,</hi> for which he inſtituted a convenient courſe, and judged withall that the Pain of the Part was from the uſuall way Nature had taken to the old Iſſue, whither the ſharp Humours making their paſſage, and finding no vent, did diſperſe themſelves through all the branches of the Axillary Artery on that ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Scapulary and Thoracick branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Pain being everywhere found according to the places of their diſtribution.</p>
                     <p>To the Cure of this, beſides what was inwardly adminiſtred, it was thought requiſite to eat down deep by a Cauſtick into the place where the old Iſſue had been, and thereby to divide the Fibres of the Membrane of the <hi>Biceps,</hi> which lay juſt under it, and ſeemed to be the place of the principall Pain. When this was done, we divided the Eſoar, and cut it out, then filled the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95669:98"/>Opening with Praecipitate, and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilicon.</hi> with <hi>ol. liliorum</hi> upon it, and dreſſed it up. We dreſſed it every other day, till the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eſcar and Slough ſeparated; then we incarned and cicatrized the Ulcer even. From the time of the Opening this her Pain ceaſed, and ſhe was well of that, but laboured under a <hi>Rheumatiſmus</hi> in great meaſure, it ſwelling her Thighs, Legs, Hips, and lower Belly: but by frequent Phlebotomy, Purging, and other Preſcriptions, ſhe was by my ſaid Friend happily cured.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with Fluxion.</head>
                     <p>BUT it rarely happens that Pain afflicts an Ulcer without Afflux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: we ſhall therefore ſay ſomewhat of that, it being a great cauſe of the difficulty we meet with in the Cure of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>What the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Fluxion are,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> hath been delivered when I treated of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in generall,</hi> viz. the Part mittent, and Part recipient: That vicious Humours peccant in quantity or quality are either thruſt forth by the Part mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, through the ſtrength of nature; or attracted by the Part recipient, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of heat or pain; or are moved to it by reaſon of its weakneſs, or low ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which rendreth the deſcent of the Humours more eaſy.</p>
                     <p>An Ulcer with Afflux of Humours is diſcerned by the tumefaction of the Lips and Parts about it;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and from the abundance of excrementitious Humours flowing from the Ulcer. It is alſo accompanied with Inflammation proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the quality of the Humours.</p>
                     <p>All Ulcers with Fluxion are of difficult Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſticks.</note> the Ulcers being thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lax and indiſpoſed with Pain, Tumour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by how much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Influx of Humour is, ſo much the more difficult is the Cure.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Ulcer, the Cauſe of the Fluxion is to be enquired into;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> whether it proceedeth from Humours peccant in quantity or quality, thruſt forth by the Part mittent upon the inferiour weak Parts, or that it was attracted to it by reaſon of heat or pain. If Heat was the Cauſe, that muſt be removed as hath been ſaid in the Chapter of a <hi>Hot Intemperies.</hi> If Pain was the Cauſe, you muſt endeavour to mitigate that by Lenients, as hath been ſhewed in the preceding Chapter. If Plenitude be the Cauſe, a ſlender Diet ought to be preſcribed, and Venaeſection if nothing hinders, and the Body kept ſoluble by Clyſters and the like.</p>
                     <p>If the Humours offend by reaſon of their evill quality, Purgatives are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according to the quality of the Humour: and if they be too fluid, they muſt be incraſſated and contemperated by Alteratives, as Endive, Succory, Sorrell, Purſlane, Lettice, in Broths; alſo Barly-cream, Emulſions, Violets, Citron, Rasburies, and the like: and the Humour flowing to the weak Part may be averted by Revulſion, Interception, and Repulſion. What they are, and where they ought to be applied, you may ſee more particularly in the Treatiſe of <hi>Tumours in generall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Medicaments proper to ſtrengthen the weak Part, and reſiſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, ought to be of a cold and aſtringent quality; as <hi>fol. plantag. polygon. ſummit. rubi, equiſeti, cort. ulmi, flor. roſ. rub. bacc. myrtill, balauſt. nuc. gland.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95669:99"/>querc. cypreſs. gallor.</hi> Some of theſe may be juiced, others powdered and mixt with Unguents, or boiled in <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> or red Wine, and applied with Stupes to the Part. In great Fluxion and in ſtrong Bodies <hi>aq. aluminis</hi> and <hi>aq. calcis</hi> may be of uſe; to the latter of which may be added a few grains of Sublimate.</p>
                     <p>The Unguents may be <hi>unguent. nutritum, alb. camphorat. unguent. deſiccativ. rub. cerat. Galeni, Emplaſtr. de minio, è bolo,</hi> &amp;c. But foraſmuch as theſe Ulcers are frequently diſturbed by ſharp Humours impacted in the Pores, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repelled, and by their acrimony may ſtir up pain and Inflammation; you ſhall therefore have regard to the Ulcer, to digeſt and deterge it, while you outwardly reſiſt the Influx upon the Parts about it: and let your Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents be ſuch as are more drying then in ſimple Ulcers, but with little acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: of which ſort you may find choice ſet down in the Chapter of the <hi>Moiſt Intemperies,</hi> to which I refer you. The Ulcer deterged, you may incarn with ſuch like: ℞ <hi>terebinth. Venet.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſevi vaccini</hi> ℥j. <hi>plumb. uſti</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>tutiae praepar. corn. cerv. uſti, an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Miſc.</hi> To which may be added <hi>thus, ſarcocolla, reſina pin.</hi> &amp;c. For in the dreſſing of Ulcers the proportioning of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to be left to the diſcretion of the Chirurgeon, avoiding greaſy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications in theſe Ulcers as much as may be. The Ulcer incarned, you may proceed by Epuloticks, as hath been all along ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>A Maid-ſervant living in a Noble Family had cut the inſide of her right Leg by a Fall upon a hot Grate-iron,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of an Ulcer with Fluxion</note> and, having ſuffered about eight weeks under ill Chirurgery, was commended to my care. The Ulcer was with loſs of ſubſtance and ſanious, with ſome pituitous Swelling in the Lips and Parts about. I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> mixed with Praecipitate, as it is uſually in my Salvatory, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. of it to one ounce of the Unguent. I applied over it an <hi>Emplaſtr. diachalcit.</hi> ſprinkled with a little <hi>acetum,</hi> and a Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> then rowled it up with the expulſive Bandage; the Cure indeed conſiſting mainly in the well rowling, the want of that cauſing frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Crudity in the Ulcer. By the uſe of it both the Influx was reſtrained, and the Member ſtrengthened, and with the help of the Unguent aforeſaid it was digeſted: as the Lips flatted by virtue of Compreſſion it, incarned, and by <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and Pledgits dipt in <hi>aq. calcis</hi> cicatrized in few days, without Purging or Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>A Man about fifty years old,<note place="margin">2 Obſervat.</note> of a groſs Body, frequently afflicted with the Gout, and labouring then under it in his left Leg, (as I remember) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to an Empirick, who pretended extraordinary skill in the Cure of that Diſeaſe, but underſtood no more then what he had learned by Books. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Leg was much ſwelled with pituitous Humours, as moſt fat Bodies are that have long laboured under the Gout, and no Medicaments or Bandage were uſed to fortify the weak Member. He began the Cure by Purging, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by bathing his Leg in a Tub with ſome Decoction of Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Bath might poſſibly be good; but the putting his Leg into it, as it ſeemed, ſerved but to lead the Humours more powerfully down to it, and encreaſed the Swelling. Whereupon he was again purged by ſtrong Catharticks, it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Lockyer</hi>'s <hi>Pills:</hi> he was alſo frequently vomited as roughly; but without ſucceſs, the Gout continuing, and the Leg growing more weak and ſwelled. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were uſed by Emplaſters of various ſorts, and Purgatives repeated, till the Patient's ſpirits and ſtrength were near exhauſted, the Empirick confidently promiſing a Cure thereby. But the Patient not able longer to endure his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, I was ſent for, and found him extreamly weak, and complaining much of Pain. I took an Emplaſter off his Leg, I ſuppoſe <hi>Emplaſtr. de ranis cum
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95669:99"/>Mercurio,</hi> or ſome Solution of Mercury with Gums; it was ſpred thick upon Leather, and lay in great wrinkles about the whole Leg: under it was great Excoriation, with Tumour and Inflammation. I cauſed ſome water to be warmed, and while it was held over a Veſſell my Servant bathed it with a Sponge, to cleanſe it, and give a breathing to the Humour. I then dreſſed the Ulceration with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and applied <hi>ceratum refrigerans Galeni,</hi> cut into pieces, to give way for the diſcharge of the Humour, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Leg from the Foot to the Knee. After I had continued this method of dreſſing a few days, mitigated the pain, and digeſted the Ulceration, I left off the uſe of the Cerote, dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. deſiccativ. rubr.</hi> applied <hi>unguent. nutritum</hi> over all, then rowled the Member more ſtrictly, and thereby cicatrized the Ulceration, and he was free from the Gout. I ordered him a laced Stocking, and by moderate and equall lacing it reſtored the Leg to a better ſhape then it had been in many years before, and left him well recruited in his ſtrength; forewarning him again to truſt ſuch Braggers.</p>
                     <p>A Servant to a Nobleman in the Country, by a Fall upon a ſharp piece of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat.</note> bruiſed and cut his left Leg from the Shin-bone tranſverſe the outſide of the Calf of his leg. Through neglect in the Country it inflamed and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very much, and the Ulcer became undigeſted. He was ſent up to Town, and lodged near me. I fomented the Part affected with Wine, dreſſed the Ulcer <hi>cum terebinth. vitell. ovi &amp; far. hordei,</hi> applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs wrung out of the ſaid Fomentation, and rowled it up; then let him bloud. The next day I fomented his Leg with a Decoction of ſome of the Simples above mentioned, dreſſed his Ulcer as before, and applied an Emplaſter of <hi>farina fabarum, pulv. roſ. rubr. balauſt. bacc. myrtill. ſumacb,</hi> decocted in Wine, adding ſome <hi>mel commune</hi> to it. Thus in few days the Ulcer digeſted, and the Tumour waſted. Then I deterged with the ſame Digeſtive, adding <hi>pulv. rad. ariſtoloch. ireos, ſarcocoll. &amp; mel roſ.</hi> touching the Ulcer with the Vitriol-ſtone daily more or leſs, and applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> as at firſt; then by a more ſtrict Bandage diſpoſed the Lips of the Ulcer to incarn; and by <hi>unguent, è plumbo &amp; deſiccativ. rubr.</hi> I cicatrized it, and directed him a laced Stocking to be put on, and returned him to his Lord.</p>

                     <p>THE ariſing of luxurious Fleſh in Ulcers ſometimes createth a difficulty in their Cure.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is either from abundance of ſerous Humours flowing into them;<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> or the ignorance of the Chirurgeon, in not diſtinguiſhing the ſuperfluous Fleſh from the good, who thereupon continueth the uſe of mild Detergents or drying Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are ſo evident that they need no Remarks.</p>
                     <p>The Indication of <hi>Cure</hi> is taken from the Cauſe.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> If Fluxion were the Cauſe, Purging and Bleeding may doe good, and a regulation of Diet, with the uſe of ſuch Remedies as may reſiſt the Fluxion; as you may ſee in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if too mild Detergents or Sarcoticks cauſed the Fleſh to grow lax and ſpongie, then more powerfull Driers are required, yea cathaeretick or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Medicaments, as you ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The milder are <hi>ſpong. uſt. cort. granat. nuc. gallar. lapis tutiae, alumen uſtum;</hi> and amongſt them <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> may well be reckoned, if uſed alone. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds are theſe: ℞ <hi>nuc. gallar. cort. granat. an.</hi>

                     <p>A Gentleman of about twenty years old,<note place="margin">Obſervat. of an Ulcer with looſe Fleſh.</note> of a good Habit of body, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my hands for the Cure of an Ulcer on his right Side the breadth of the Palm of a hand. It was occaſioned by a Burn, and had been bigger. The cauſe why this remaining part of the Ulcer did not cicatrize was moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it being over-grown with looſe Fleſh. I applied Pledgits of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> with two parts <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> upon it, with Bandage: but obſerving it not to yield to that ſo ſoon as I deſigned, I levelled it with the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick-ſtone, and after ſeparation of the Eſcar digeſted the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and afterwards cicatrized it with ſome of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above mentioned.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bones.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Caries</hi> or Rottenneſs in the Bone is frequently found in Ulcers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giveth riſe to them: but however it is, it alway prolongeth and rendreth the Cure of them difficult.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bones are either internall,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> as through retention or acrimony of the Matter, or ſome occult quality, as in <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> where the Bone is carious, and the Skin is whole; or in ſtrumous Ulcers near the Bones, where the Eroſion begins in the Bone it ſelf; or they are corrupted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally by the Air. Bruiſes, Wounds in the Head, through ill Chirurgery, may corrupt both Tables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this I never met with in any Patient of my own, or where I had power to govern. The Bone may alſo be fouled by over-ſharp Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>If the Bone be bare, its Corruption is eaſily diſcerned,<note place="margin">Signe.</note> though ſometimes it be covered with a grumous or viſcous Matter, which rubb'd off, the Bone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth white, brown, or black. If the white be pory, the <hi>Caries</hi> may be deeper and more dangerous then if it were black and hard. If the Bone lie ſo hid as that you cannot feel it with your Probe, yet you may judge it carious from the quantity or quality of the Matter. If the Bone lie near, and the Fleſh lax and white, it is ſhrewdly ſuſpicious that the Bone is carious: but if the Matter ſtink or be oily, it is a more certain ſign of a Rottenneſs. Ulcers of long continuance near a Bone do alſo foreſhew a <hi>Caries,</hi> according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Si <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera annua aut etiam diuturniora fiant, oſſa corrumpi neceſſe eſt.</hi> Alſo the difficulty in cicatrizing them, and the frequent and ſudden Eruption of them after they are cured, giveth a ſuſpicion of a foul Bone. But if the Bone be much corrupted, the Matter is foetid, and the Probe will penetrate into it.</p>
                     <p>Ulcers with <hi>Caries</hi> or Rottenneſs in the Bones are of difficult Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and reckoned amongſt the Cacoethe and malign Ulcers; but are more or leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous where the great Joynts or heads of the Bones are affected, where the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon cannot ſafely apply ſuch Remedies as are proper for Exfoliation.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of Ulcers with <hi>Caries</hi> a good Diet is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and the peccant Humours to be evacuated and averted by Bleeding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> left they cauſe Fluxion. And foraſmuch as in the Cure of theſe Ulcers the corrupt Bones muſt be firſt removed, and a <hi>Callus</hi> generated, before you can hope for Sanation; therefore you muſt in the firſt place make way to the Bone, that, if it be poſſible, you may have it in your ſight. To which purpoſe, if the outward Orifice be ſmall, you muſt enlarge it proportionably according as the <hi>Caries</hi> is greater or leſſer, and ſcrape the rotten Fleſh away, or conſume it by Eſcaroticks. But if by reaſon of the nervous and great Veſſells, as in the Hands, Feet, and in the great Joynts or Spine, you cannot ſafely doe it; you ſhall then by prepared Sponge, Gentian roots, or the like, dilate the Ulcer till the <hi>Caries</hi> be bared. But if the <hi>Caries</hi> lie juſt under ſome comſiderable Nerve, Tendon or Artery, ſo that you cannot well come to apply your Medicaments to the Bone; you are then to conſider whether the <hi>Caries</hi> can be removed without laying the Bone more bare: and if that be not fecible, you are then to conſider the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice may happen to the Patient in the cutting off thoſe Veſſells, and, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95669:101"/>the Worthineſs of them with the Inconveniences which may behappen the Patient from the <hi>Caries,</hi> proceed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The Bone laid bare, you are then to conſider the <hi>Caries,</hi> whether great or ſmall, deep or ſuperficiall, hard or ſoft; and proceed by Medicaments or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Operation accordingly. The Bones of the Head do not admit of the hot Iron, nor need it. The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back will neither admit of Cauteries, Rugin, or ſharp Medicaments, the Spine of them excepted: nor will the <hi>Sternon</hi> or Rib admit of the Cautery. The Heel-bone requires alſo great caution, for that it is ſoft, and rarely exfoliates by rough handling. In the reſt you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by Cautery, actuall or potentiall, Rugin, or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Caries</hi> be ſuperficiall, and the Bone firm, you may by Medicaments of a moderate drying quality conſume the moiſture in the <hi>Caries,</hi> and thereby dry the Bone, and diſpoſe it by virtue of its oſſifick faculty to thruſt out a <hi>Callus,</hi> and make ſeparation of its <hi>Caries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The milder ſort are, <hi>rad. ireos, peucedanum, rad. ariſtoloch. myrrha, aloe, cort. pin.</hi> and <hi>ſpir. vini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſtronger are, <hi>euphorbium, unguent. Aegyptiac. ol. garyophyll. ſpir. vitriol. ſulphur, paſtill. Andronis, Muſae, polyid.</hi> But theſe require to be uſed with caution, and the ſound Parts to be well defended from their acrimony.</p>
                     <p>The Powders above mentioned may be applied upon the Bone with Doſſills of Lint over them, to keep the Lips of the Ulcer diſtended; or may be mixed with <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſicc. aut mel roſat. vel commun.</hi> or uſed in a ſpirit of Wine, or with <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> or thus in the form of Injections: ℞ <hi>ſymphyt. maj. gentian. ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoloch. rot. &amp; long. rad. ireos, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>flor. roſ. rub. ſumach, balauſt. an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>coq. in vin. alb. ad</hi>

                     <p>The ſpongie Bones in the Hands or Feet are to be kept bare by Doſſills, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the <hi>Caries:</hi> and if the whole Bone be corrupt, it will dry and ſeparate from the Joynts in time, and the Ulcer happily cure; yet, to haſten it, you may dry it with an actuall Cautery. But if the Bone be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carious in one part, as in the middle or at the end, to haſten the Cure you may nip it there in pieces with a pair of Pincers, pull away the broken bits, and dreſs it lightly with ſome of the above milder Driers; whereby in few days the <hi>Caries</hi> will caſt forth, a <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt out, and unite the two ends, as in fractured Bones, if the native heat of the Part be preſerved the while.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Caries</hi> be in the great Bones, and lie deep, and be ſubject to the inflowing of Matter; your ſpeedieſt way will be by manuall Operation, <hi>viz.</hi> either by Rugines or actual Cautery. If you can come eaſily to the Bone to ſcrape it, as in the <hi>Cranium,</hi> that way will be moſt proper. You are to ſcrape till you find it firm, or that you diſcern a ruddineſs in the Bone; and not onely till it look white, for that is the naturall colour of the outer Shell of the Bone: yet in ſome it is frequently found pory and carious while it retains that colour; and if you do not rugine that away, the <hi>Callus</hi> will be ſlow in thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out; and if you do rugine it, the deeper you enter into it, the browner and ſofter the Bone will be. Therefore you muſt be cautious in this Work, leſt you penetrate to the Marrow of the Bone, when poſſibly you needed not have taken away more then the external Shell of it.</p>
                     <p>The Bone rugined, dreſs it up with the milder Sarcoticks: or, if you had rather uſe an Unguent, ℞ <hi>terebinth. clarae</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>gum. elemi</hi> ℥ij. <hi>reſin. pineae,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95669:101"/>maſtich. an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>thuris, ſarcocolae, an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>Miſc. ſuper ignem.</hi> Apply this warm upon Lint, and in few days you may ſee the Fleſh thruſt forth in ſmall grains, which is <hi>Callus,</hi> and in a few days more thruſt off ſmall Speels from the Bone you ſcraped.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Caries</hi> be ſo deep that you cannot rugine it, then with a <hi>Terebellum</hi> make penetration into it to the found part, or by an actual Cautery conſume the Rottenneſs. In order to this work, if the Ulcer be narrow, you are to paſs it through a <hi>Cannula</hi> fitted to go down through the Ulcer to the Bone: which <hi>Cannula</hi> or Pipe ought to be covered with an Emplaſter or Linen ſtarched on, and oiled, to paſs in more eaſily. Then having a Baſon of Water ready to cool the Pipe, you ſhall place the <hi>Cannula</hi> upon the carious Bone, having firſt cleanſed the Matter from it with armed Probes: then paſs the actuall Cautery down through the <hi>Cannula</hi> to the Bone ſo often till you have dried it, pulling out the <hi>Cannula</hi> after each heat. So you may perform the work without ſcorching the Lips of the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>According as the Bone is rotten, ſo the Humour will ſpurt out from it upon the firſt application of the Cautery: but upon repeating it, that Bone will be ſo dry that you ſhall not hear it hiſs; beſides, you may feel the Bone firm. Then dreſs it with the white of Eggs beaten with the Mucilage of Quince-ſeeds extracted in <hi>aq. germ. querc.</hi> or the like, and dreſs the ſcorched Ulcer and Lips with <hi>unguent. refriger. Galeni,</hi> and a Cerote of the ſame over that and the neighbouring Parts. Continue this way of dreſſing till the heat of the Ulcer be mitigated: then, if the Lips be veſicated, dreſs them with <hi>unguent. album, tutiae,</hi> or the like, and the Bone with the milder Exfoliatives, and keep the Ulcer open till the burnt Bone caſt off; then throw out the Doſſills, and you ſhall ſee the Ulcer incarn and cicatrize by the moſt familiar Epuloticks.</p>
                     <p>IN the year 1652. paſſing from <hi>Cheſhire</hi> into the County of <hi>Rutland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> taking <hi>North-Luffenham</hi> in my way to <hi>London,</hi> I was deſired there to viſit a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, who had laboured under a Fever, and had been long Bed-rid by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a grievous pain in his right Thigh, which was ſuppoſed the <hi>Criſis</hi> of that Fever. I ſaw him much emaciated, and his pained Thigh was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the bigger of the two, but it retained its ſhape without any viſible Tumour, Inflammation or hardneſs; nor was the Fluctuation ſo diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as that I could poſitively ſay there was Matter, it lying ſo deep and equally in the outſide of it: but, ſuſpecting Matter, I opened it on the outſide accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the length of the Member, and feeling my Knife in the Cavity, I made the Apertion large, and diſcharged a putrid Matter like the Lees of Beer. After I had diſcharged a Porringer-full, I dreſſed the Opening <hi>cum unguent. baſilic.</hi> upon a Tent, with an Emplaſter <hi>de minio</hi> over it, and with Compreſs and Bandage rowled it up. The next day, finding the Patient relieved, and the Matter plentifully diſcharged, I fomented the Tumour with a Decoction of <hi>abſinth. flor. cham. roſ. rubr.</hi> and ſuch like, and making a ſearch with my Probe, found the Bone bare a great length. I enlarged the Opening, to make more way for the Matter, and the better to apply my Medicines to the Bone; then dreſſed it up as before, and againſt the next day made an Injection <hi>ſummitat. hyperici, centaurii, rad. conſolid. maj. biſtort. tormentill. gentian. ireos:</hi> to which ſtrained liquour I added <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and caſt ſome of it daily in warm to deterge the Ulcer. His body was kept ſoluble by Clyſters of Milk and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and his Spirits relieved by a morſell of <hi>theriac. Lond.</hi> with <hi>couſ. lujulae.</hi> I alſo ordered him a Julep made with a few Strawberry-leaves and roots, a little Ivory, and a cruſt of Bread, infuſed a ſtick of Cinnamon in the ſtrained De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, put in a few drops of <hi>ſpir. ſulphur.</hi> and ſweetned it with Sugar. His
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95669:102"/>Diet was Oatmeal-Caudle, Broth, Grewells, and Eggs; and as his Appetite increaſed, we allowed him a more liberall Diet. Although the Opening was large, and the Thigh very bare of Fleſh; yet, by reaſon of the diſtance the Bone lay from the Opening, and the hollowneſs of the Ulcer, it was not poſſible to make any Applications to the Bone by Medicaments to exfoliate it, that ſhould not be offenſive to the Ulcer, if they were ſo powerfully drying as the Bone required. Therefore I cauſed an actuall Cautery to be made at the next Smith's, and dried the Bone that way, and the while continued the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid method of dreſſing, keeping the Orifice moderately dilated with Doſſills preſt out of the Injection; then by good Compreſs and Bandage ſqueezed out the Matter, inſomuch as it leſſened daily, the more remote Cavities aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and the Ulcer was like to cure, if the <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bone did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it. That it might not, I got the Cautery made in the form of a Wedge, but thicker, to retain heat; and having fitted it with a <hi>Cannula,</hi> I placed it upon the Bone according to the length of the <hi>Caries,</hi> paſſed the Cautery through it to the Bone, and repeated it again and again, cooling the <hi>Cannula</hi> each time in a diſh of water near me: then I covered the Bone, and dreſſed the Opening with Doſſills dipt in a Mucilage of Barley and Comfrey-roots, faſtning a Thread to thoſe Doſſills which I conveyed firſt in towards the Bone, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring them out again, and applied <hi>unguent. refrigerans Galeni</hi> outward upon the Ulcer, with an Emplaſter of <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> over all. This way of dreſſing I continued daily till the Excoriation was healed without: then I repeated the uſe of the former Injection, adding <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. ſumach,</hi> with a little <hi>alumen,</hi> and by Compreſs and Bandage haſtned the unition of it within, leaving the Exfoliation of the Bone to nature. While I ſtay'd in that Country, the Cavity filled up, and by the well-digeſted and little Matter the Ulcer ſeemed near cured; and I was afterwards informed that the Patient followed his Husbandry ſome one or two months after. The Exfoliation was here inſenſible, as it moſt frequently happens, the Scales mouldering away, and diſcharging with the Matter.</p>

Obſervat. of an Ulcer with <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Tibia</hi> and <hi>Fibula</hi> of the right Leg.</note> having been long afflicted in the Country with Ulcers on his right Leg and Foot, came to <hi>London,</hi> and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my hands. There wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> one large Ulcer upon the <hi>Fibula</hi> near the Ancle here and there ſuperficially cicatrized. Upon ſearch with a Probe I found the Bone carious in ſeverall places, but covered with the Tendons of the <hi>Pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neïs.</hi> On the inſide of the Leg upon the <hi>Tibia</hi> near the Ancle there were alſo Ulcers with <hi>Caries:</hi> the Foot was alſo ulcerated, and the Leg and Foot ſwelled. I began with the laying open of that Ulcer on the outſide upon the <hi>Fibula</hi> by the application of a Cauſtick, and dividing the Eſcar took out ſome ſmall pieces of Bones which lay looſe in the Ulcer. The <hi>Fibula</hi> it ſelf was covered with the Tendons of the Muſcle <hi>Peroneïs,</hi> ſo as there was no poſſibility of applying Medicaments to exfoliate the Bone, nor indeed of curing the Ulcer, whilſt thoſe Tendons lay in the way. Wherefore I cut them tranſverſly; upon which diviſion the upper part of them contracted, and then the <hi>Fibula</hi> appeared bare and black. I applied dry Lint upon the Bone, and dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> hot, to haſten Digeſtion and ſeparation of the Sloughs. The other Ulcers and Excoriations I dreſſed, ſome with Deterſives, and others with Epuloticks, according as they required; and with Compreſs and Bandage endeavoured to preſs out the pituitous Humours affecting thoſe Parts. As the Eſcars began to ſeparate, I deterged by the uſe of the Vitriol-ſtone and Praecipitate, and dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>tinctura vitrioli dulc.</hi> of Felix Wurtz. The upper ends of the Tendons ſuffered Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with great <hi>tremor</hi> upon the application or taking off Dreſſings; but it was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95669:102"/>without pain: yet, ſuſpecting the worſt, I cut as much off of the Tendons (with a pair of Sciſſors) as lay bare, then dipt them <hi>cum oleo terebinth.</hi> hot, and dreſſed them with Praecipitate. By this way of dreſſing the remaining ends of the Tendons digeſted and incarned with the fleſhy Parts, and by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Epuloticks cicatrized: ſo alſo the main Ulcer cicatrized round from the edges to the carious Bone, thruſting off the rotten edges of them before it. During this I healed the Ulcers and Excoriations on his Foot, and by the help of a laced Stocking preſt back the pituitous Humours, and reduced the Member to its true ſhape. Having thus happily ſucceeded, I began with the laying open the Ulcer upon the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> by Cauſtick, and in dividing the Sloughs took out ſeverall fragments of Bones which lay intangled in the Fleſh. After ſeparation of the Eſcar, i deterged that Ulcer after the ſame manner as the former; and indeed by rubbing the carious Bones with the Vitriol-ſtone I haſtned the Exfoliation of them. They came away in bits at ſeverall times, but that of the <hi>Fibula</hi> was thruſt off by the <hi>Callus</hi> underneath in one piece. After the Exfoliation of the Bones I purged the Patient with a cathartick Apozeme, and preſcribed him a Decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> &amp;c. and ſoon after cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized the Ulcers; but adviſed him to continue the wearing of the laced Stocking.</p>
                     <p>A Young man by ſome accident bruiſed the Back of his hand:<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of an Ulcer with rotten Bones in the Hand.</note> it inflamed and apoſtemated, and after ſome while terminating in a ſinuous Ulcer, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath corrupting the Bone, I was conſulted, and adviſed the way of dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it: but that method not being obſerved, other Bones of the Hand became carious, and the Hand in great hazzard of being loſt. Upon which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to my care. Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> being preſent, I took off the Dreſſings, made a ſearch with a Probe, and felt the Bones leading to the two middle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bare, rough, and, as I ſuſpected, rotten. The Orifice being ſmall, I applied a Cauſtick large enough to make way for the taking out thoſe Bones; then divided the Eſcar, and dreſſed up his Hand with Digeſtives, Emplaſter and Bandage. Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> preſcribed him a vulnerary Decoction, and left the proſecution of the Cure to me. As the Eſcar ſeparated, I ſaw the Bones lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the two middle fingers black, and ſoftned with Putrefaction. I laid hold on the one with my <hi>Forceps,</hi> and pinched it into pieces with much eaſe, bringing part of it away. I fomented the Hand with <hi>decoct. abſinth.</hi> &amp;c. in Wine, diſſolved a little <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> in ſome of it, waſhed the Ulcer, and applied a Doſſill dipt hot in it upon the Bone, and <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> over the Eſcar. I then pinched out what was moſt rotten, dreſſed the remaining ends of them with a mixture of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. ſpirit. vini</hi> and <hi>extract. ſcordii</hi> actually hot with an armed Probe, applied Pledgits of the ſame upon the Bones, rubb'd the looſe Fleſh in the Ulcer with a Vitriol-ſtone, and laid <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> upon Pledgits over the tender edges of the Ulcer. By this way of dreſſing I deterg'd the Ulcer, and at ſeverall times pinching out thoſe rotten Bones that led to the two middle Fingers, diſpoſed the reſt to caſt off. During which I laid the Ulcer higher open to the Joynt of the middle Finger: which Knuckle I alſo found rotted to pieces, and took out what would come eaſily away; then dreſſed the remaining <hi>Caries</hi> as the other in the Hand, and after ſome time made a ſeparation of the <hi>Caries</hi> there. Having the while digeſted and healed the Ulcer I firſt laid open, I alſo cicatrized this Part, and diſmiſſed the Patient well cured, as I thought. But ſome while after he came to me again with a Tumour upon that Knuckle of the middle Finger, from ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Splinter of a Bone. I laid it open, and took that out. While I was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, I obſerved a ſmall Opening, with a Tumour near it as big as a ſmall Hazell-nut, upon that part of the Bone which led to the Fore-finger. I opened
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95669:103"/>this by Cauſtick, and, diſcovering part of the Bone black, pinched it off, and dreſſed the remaining end with <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> ſcalding hot upon an armed Probe. I kept the Ulcer open with Doſſills preſt out with <hi>ſpirit. vini</hi> till I made ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, then cured this Ucler alſo. And from that time, which is more then five years, he hath continued well, and his Hand is firm and ſtrong; Nature having ſupplied that loſs of Bones with <hi>Callus.</hi> But he beareth the Marks of the Diſeaſe, which wil aſſert the truth of what is here delivered. You may ſee more of this work in the Treatiſe of <hi>Struma.</hi>

                     <p>An Officer of the King's Regiment of Foot,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat.</note> of a Sanguine and healthfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, marching at the head of his Company in a hot Summer's day, heated his Bloud, and was ſeized with a pain in one of his Teeth of the lower right Jaw. He ſent for a Tooth-drawer, who pulling out the Tooth brake the <hi>Alveoli</hi> off from the Jaw according to the length of it. The pain made great Fluxion, and required Evacuation and Revulſion by Bleeding and the like. But this being omitted, and the Part affected not treated as it ought, the pain increaſed, the neighbouring Parts ſwelled and apoſtemated, and all his Teeth and part of the <hi>Alveoli</hi> caſt off. After ſome weeks continuance in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, finding his Diſeaſe increaſe upon him, he came to Town, and ſent for me. That ſide of his Head, Face and Neck were extreamly ſwelled outwardly, ſo was the Cheek and Tonſill within, and the fractured Bones hidden within the Tumour. Upon a preſſure with my hand on the outſide of his Cheek, ſeeing the Matter flow into his Mouth out of a ſmall Opening near the farther part of that Jaw, I made a ſearch with a Probe, and felt the Jaw bare. There was a neceſſity of laying that Orifice open, for the more eaſy diſcharging of the Matter: which being done, I employed my endeavours to take off the Fluxion and Fever he laboured under, let him bloud from that Arm ten ounces, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Fomentations and Cataplaſms to be applied outwardly to diſcuſs the Tumour, and inwardly an Injection to deterge the Ulcer of <hi>rad. ireos, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till. biſtort. ariſtoloch.</hi> with <hi>ſyr. è roſis ſiccis,</hi> and a little <hi>ſpirit. vini;</hi> alſo a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to waſh his mouth of <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. plantag. ſummitat. rubi,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>diamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and <hi>ſpirit. vitrioli dulcificat.</hi> Doctour <hi>Warner</hi> being conſulted, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Anodyne draughts, Cordialls, Juleps, Emulſions, and purging Apozems. The <hi>Cacochymia</hi> thus evacuated, and the Humours contemperated, we hoped the outward and inward Swellings and diſcharge of Matter would have leſſened: but they not yielding one jot to our endeavours, I laid open the Cheek from the Orifice I had enlarged forward alongſt the Bone, with intention to take it out; but it was ſo ſhut in that I could by no means get it out, till with Watch-makers Files I cut through that Bone; then the ends thruſt out into his mouth. Theſe I pulled out: they proved to be pieces of the <hi>Alveoli.</hi> Then I felt the Jaw it ſelf ariſe; and, conſidering that if it were looſe it muſt out, I paſſed the end of my Probe under it, whereupon it roſe up, having been ſome while looſe, and was onely held down by the foreſaid <hi>Alveoli;</hi> which being removed, the Jaw came away without the leaſt pain or one drop of bloud, he onely crying out of his Ear, as if it had made a hole through there.</p>
                     <p>The Jaw being extracted, the ſide was ready to fall in: to prevent which I cauſed the Patient to hold it ſtretched out with his fingers in his mouth, and a Looking-glaſs held before him, that he might the better ſee to keep it more exactly even, whilſt I by agglutinative Powders <hi>cum albumine ovi</hi> made a Cruſt upon the outſide; which with Paſtboard wet <hi>in aceto</hi> applied over it ſate cloſe to it, and after it was dried kept that ſide of the Cheek firm, and by Bandage it continued ſo, he helping it as hath been above ſaid. It alſo was ſomewhat ſtiffned by the hard Swelling which was in the Cheek.</p>
                     <p>To haſten the <hi>Callus,</hi> I gave him daily <hi>oſteocoll.</hi> as I had read in <hi>Fabr.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95669:103"/>Hildanus</hi> his Works. Whilſt his Chaps were thus bound up, I continued to waſh his Mouth with the Decoction aboveſaid injected often in a day with a Syringe; by which means the Ulcer was cleanſed and cured, and diſpoſed to a <hi>Callus,</hi> which grew and hardned in leſs then twenty days ſo equall with the other, as without looking in his Mouth it could not be diſcerned.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with Callous Lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT alſo frequently happens that Ulcers become callous, hard and livid, and are thereby rendred difficult of Cure.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Ulcers are generally annuall,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and through length of time contract this Calloſity and hardneſs with a livid colour. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of theſe are the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent defluxion of a hot <hi>Serum,</hi> which hath been condenſed by the Air, or by over-cooling or drying Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are evident from what hath been ſaid of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> of them is,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> that the Ulcer cannot cure till the Calloſity be removed: and if the Ulcer be of a round figure, that ought alſo to be changed.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Ulcer you are to conſider the hardneſs of the Lips;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> for from what cauſe ſoever it ariſeth, that muſt be removed, or depreſt to cicatrize with the Ulcer; for no Ulcer skinneth well but from the edges. Therefore if the Lips be hard and callous in the Superficies, you ſhall endeavour by emollient and diſcutient Medicaments to ſoften them, and by good Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage diſpoſe them to cure firſt, by a Fomentation of <hi>rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, lilior. mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae, ſem. lini &amp; foenugraeci, flor. cham. melilot. ſambuci.</hi> By this you may alſo rarefy the condenſed bloud, which maketh the lividity in the Parts about the Ulcer, and preventeth the generation of good Fleſh. Then you may embrocate the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Lips with <hi>unguent. dialthaeae, ol. amygdal. dulc. ol. lilior. lumbricor.</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>cerat. oeſypi, cerat. Galeni, Emplaſtr. è mucilag. diachyl. ireat.</hi> or, if ſtronger be required, <hi>Empl. de ranis cum Mercurio,</hi> or a plate of Lead rubb'd with Mercury, or a Paſt of Ceruſe or <hi>calx lot.</hi> made up with <hi>axung. porcin.</hi> and over this a good Compreſs and Bandage; of which ſort the laced Stocking is beſt for the Leg, which being well made preſerveth the other Parts from Fluxion better then a Rowler doth. But if the edges of the Lips be inverted and callous, or the Ulcer be in ſuch a place where you cannot make good Bandage, your beſt way then will be by Cauſtick or Knife to remove it, and then digeſt and heal the Lips even with the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>A Young man of about eighteen years old, of an ill Habit of body,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> having laboured long under an Ulcer on the inſide of the Ancle of a round figure, with the Lips thick and callous, and the Parts about livid, put himſelf into my hands for Cure. There was in this caſe no hopes by Emollients or Bandage to flat the Lips ſo as to diſpoſe them to cicatrize; therefore I rubb'd them with a Cauſtick-ſtone round, dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and Praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and applied <hi>Emplaſtr. diachyl. ireat.</hi> over all, with Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95669:104"/>deſigning to diſpoſe the Lips to unite with the Ulcer. But the Eſcar ſeparating ſlowly, the Lips skinned underneath, and diſappointed me. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the inverted parts being removed with the <hi>Callus</hi> underneath, I made a Paſte with <hi>calx lota</hi> and <hi>axung. porcin.</hi> and with good Compreſs forced the Lips even wih the Ulcer, then united it with a ſmooth and firm <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix.</hi>

The ſpeedy Cure of this I imputed to the laced Stocking, it performing all the Intentions neceſſary to the curing of many ſuch like Ulcers.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Putrid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</head>
                     <p>ULcers labouring under Fluxion of ſharp acrid Humours are (as I have elſewhere ſaid) for the moſt part ſordid. The <hi>Sordes</hi> as it increaſeth in the Ulcer rots the Fleſh, renders the Ulcer putrid, and the Matter foetid.</p>
                     <p>The immediate <hi>Cauſe</hi> of theſe Ulcers are groſs viſcid Humours heated in them by the <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Part,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> whence they contract a malign quality, and corrupt. They alſo happen through the unſeaſonable application of lenient or greaſy Medicaments, or by too-powerfull Detergents, which reſolve the ſound Fleſh, and ſtir up a putrefactive heat in the Ulcer, whereby the Humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſharp that they corrode the Parts about: whence they are ſometime deſervedly called <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera ſerpentia &amp; depaſcentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preceding <hi>Cauſes</hi> are excrementitious groſs Juices abounding in the body from ill Diet,<note place="margin">Cauſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.</note> Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Malign Fevers are alſo the Cauſe, by tranſmitting their malignity outward.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sign</hi> of a ſordid Ulcer is a viſcous tough Excrement ſticking in it with great heat and pain.<note place="margin">Sign.</note> As the <hi>Sordes</hi> increaſeth, it changeth its colour, by reaſon of the ſuffocation of the naturall heat, and the Ulcer corrupts, and the Matter ſtinks.</p>
                     <p>If from abundance of <hi>Sordes</hi> Tranſpiration be hindred,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> a corruption of the Part follows, and it terminates in a corroſive or putrid Ulcer: and if that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction be not checked, a Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> follows.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Ulcers a good Diet is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> with a regulation of the Non-naturalls: the viſcous Humours require to be purged, and Revulſion is to be made by Bleeding and otherways. Vulnerary Decoctions are alſo to be preſcribed, to waſte the excrementitious Humours. The Topicks or outward Medicaments are to be proportioned according to the quality of the Ulcer. In ſordid Ulcers made by too ſtrong Detergents <hi>unguent. baſilicon cum Merc. praecipitat. unguent. diapompholyg. mag.</hi> be proper to dreſs the Ulcer with; and ſome cooling Unguent or Cerote, as <hi>refrigerans Galeni,</hi> may be applied over it, with a Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:95669:104"/>
                     <p>If the Ulcer became ſordid by the uſe of Lenients, and be lined thick with the <hi>Sordes,</hi> doubt not to fill the Ulcer with Praecipitate, and apply ſome mild Detergent on Pledgits of Lint over it, with a Compreſs wrung out as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in humid Ulcers, and dreſs it not till the third day after: thereby the pain will leſſen, and the <hi>Sordes</hi> come away in a Slough. After which digeſt the Ulcer till it look more fleſhy and naturall; then proceed with milder Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and incarn.</p>
                     <p>In the common ſordid Ulcers <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and Praecipitate, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. to an ounce, <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> with <hi>alumen uſt.</hi> and <hi>unguent. apoſtolor.</hi> are proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergents.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer be putrid, waſh it with a good <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein <hi>abſinth. ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> &amp;c. have been boiled, or with <hi>ſpirit. vini</hi> and <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> or ſprinkle the Ulcer with <hi>pulv. ſine pari Joan. Ard.</hi> or <hi>pulv. troch. Andronis,</hi> &amp;c. and outwardly defend the Parts from Fluxion.</p>
                     <p>If the Ulcer be corroſive, and undermine the Lips, and render the Fleſh ſoft and unfit for healing, dreſs it as ſhall be ſhewed in a <hi>Phagedaena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the putrefaction increaſe, and the Ulcer tend to Mortification, treat it as is ſaid in <hi>Gangraena</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Woman of about forty years of age, ſcorbutically and hydropically affected,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Putrid Ulcers.</note> having long laboured under a ſordid Ulcer in the Country on the inſide of her Leg, with great pain, came at laſt to Town, and put her ſelf into my hands. The Ulcer was large and deep, with great putrefaction; the Leg was much ſwelled, inflamed, and had been excoriated in the Parts about by the acrimony of the Matter; and by the application of <hi>Nutritum</hi> or ſuch like the Matter was cruſted in, and alſo a <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> was riſen underneath very large. I fomented the Parts affected with wine, and waſhed the Ulcer with <hi>ſpirit. vini</hi> and <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> then with a <hi>Spatula</hi> thruſt out the putrid Fleſh, and ſtrewed the Ulcer with Praecipitate, dreſſing it with Pledgits preſt out of the ſame Solution, and applying an <hi>Emplaſtr. diachalcit.</hi> over it with Compreſs and Bandage. The next morning I took off the Bandage and Emplaſter, fomented the Ulcer with a <hi>Luxivium</hi> as above mentioned, applied <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. cum oleo terebinth.</hi> on the Ulcer, and a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. fabar.</hi> with <hi>oxymel,</hi> and rowled it up as before, cauſing her to keep her bed. The day after I purged her with an Infuſion of <hi>Sena,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum ſyr. de ſpina cervin. &amp; de roſ. ſol.</hi> and preſcribed her a <hi>Decoct. ſarſae, lign. guaiaci,</hi> with Antiſcorbuticks. Having by the Dreſſings aboveſaid remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Putrefaction, I endeavoured to incarn with the ſarcotick Unguent, and applied <hi>cerat. oxelaei</hi> over it with good Bandage: but it would neither deterge nor incarn nor yet digeſt for two days, till I put on a laced Stocking; by the uſe whereof the Influx was reſtrained, and the Lips preſſed down. Having diſpoſed the Ulcer to a healing condition, I incarned it with the foreſaid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of <hi>mel deſpumat.</hi> mixed with ſarcotick Powders. While I was doing that, I rubb'd part of the Lips which were callous with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and alſo rubb'd the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> off by ſome of the ſame Cauſtick. After ſeparation of the Eſcars I cicatrized the Ulcer and neighbouring Ulcerations with Epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loticks, then made her a Fontanell in the other Leg, and returned her into the Country cured.</p>

Londinenſ.</hi> and once a week purged with <hi>pulv. cornachin.</hi> I furthered the Deterſion of the Ulcer by rubbing it with the Vitriol-ſtone, and afterwards digeſted it, and endeavoured to incarn with Sarcoticks, as in the former Obſervation: but on a ſudden, without any cauſe, the Matter became ſanious and flowed in great quantity. I then dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>pulv. Andronis</hi> mixt with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> fomented the Part with <hi>ſummitat. abſinth. centaurii, hyperici, flor. roſ. rubr. bacc. myrtillor. balauſt.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in Wine, and by Intercipients upon the Knee and good Bandage endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reſiſt the Influx. Upon my complaint to the Patient and her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the difficulty I met with in the Cure, I perceived by them that the Ulcer had been frequently ſubject to ſuch diſcharge. The Phyſician was again conſulted, who concluded they were the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> that thus periodically af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Ulcer. She was again let bloud and purged, and put into a chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beate courſe, a Fontanell was alſo made in her other Leg: during which I proceeded again by Deterſives, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vitriol-ſtone, <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> alone, and with <hi>mundificat. Paracelſi,</hi> &amp;c. and applied Defenſatives, with Compreſs and a laced Stocking. By which method the Ulcer ſeemed a while well diſpoſed to incarn: but the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> being ſtill obſtructed, the Ulcer became again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, and rendred all my endeavours fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>I having ſpent ſome months in this work to little purpoſe, they grew weary of me, and were deſirous to make uſe of an Empirick, who had been it in my abſence, and promiſed a ſpeedier Cure. I gave way to the entertaining him; he alſo dreſſed the Ulcer after his way: but his endeavours proving alſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull, they came to me again. I, finding the Leg much inflamed and ſwelled, and more ſordid, dreſſed the Ulcer with Detergents as above ſaid, applying <hi>ceratum Galeni</hi> over the diſeaſed Parts with Compreſs and Bandage as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and by Sir <hi>Fran. Prujean</hi>'s leave gave her a few grains of <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> The next day it gave her four or five Vomits and a Stool or two. The next day after I fomented the Ulcer as at firſt, continued the uſe of the former Dreſſings, put her on a laced Stocking, and repeated the uſe of the <hi>Turbith</hi> three or four times, avoiding Salivation. We alſo put her into a <hi>Decoct. ſarſae, lign. guaiaci,</hi> &amp;c. and by this method incarned the Ulcer, and by a <hi>malagma</hi> of <hi>calx lot.</hi> beaten up with <hi>axungia</hi> cicatrized it. By the continuing of the laced Stocking ſhe remained well, and after ſome months thoſe Evacuations came naturally down of themſelves, which by no Art would be perſwaded, and ſhe remained well.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of</hi> Phagedaena, Nomae, Dyſepulota.</head>
                     <p>BEſides all the difficulties we find in curing of Ulcers upon the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Accidents, there yet remain divers others which are not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, nor eaſily reconciled to the ancient Nomenclature of Ulcers: I mean thoſe called <hi>Annua, Phagedaenica, Depaſcentia, Nomae.</hi> Out of which words that I may pick ſome ſenſe, I ſhall refer them to two Heads.</p>
                     <p>One, of the corroſive Ulcers, which from their corroding the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Parts have obtained ſeverall names in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine;</hi> as <hi>Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daenica, Depaſcentia,</hi> and <hi>Nomae:</hi> all which depend upon an acrimony of the Humour.</p>
                     <p>The other are rather the effect of ſome continuance of an Ulcer, which after long <hi>Intemperies</hi> doth by degrees ſo weaken the tone of the Fibres, deſtroy the naturall Balſame of the Part, and by frequent Fluxion induce Calloſity, that the Diſeaſe groweth very hard of Cure, and when cured is apt to break out again. Theſe, from their continuance, are called <hi>Annua;</hi> from the evill diſpoſition of the Part, <hi>Cacoethe;</hi> from the hardneſs of cicatrizing, <hi>Dyſepulota;</hi> from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaur had in Chirurgery, <hi>Chironia;</hi> and <hi>Telephia,</hi> from the hard fate of <hi>Telephus,</hi> whoſe Wound could not be cured but by the Spear that wounded him. Theſe latter being inſignificant names, not deſcribing the nature of any Ulcer, I ſhall content my ſelf onely to have explained them in few words: but the former, namely <hi>Phagedaena,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcus depaſcens, Nomae</hi> and <hi>Dyſepulota,</hi> deſerve farther conſideration, and are our preſent task.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phagedaena</hi> ſtrictly ſo called is an Ulcer with ſwelled Lips,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> that eats the Fleſh and neighbouring Parts in the bottome and edges of the Ulcer. It differs from <hi>Herpes,</hi> becauſe that always begins in the Skin, with little moiſture, this always affects the Fleſh, and abounds with Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noma</hi> is a deep Ulcer that eats and ſpreads without Tumour, but hath a Rottenneſs and Putrefaction joined with it.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe are venomous malignant Ulcers, and both ſpread:<note place="margin">Difference.</note> but they differ, in that one hath Tumour, and no Putrefaction; and the other Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and no Tumour.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Ulcers do all take their Originall from vicious Humours abounding in the Body. Whether they be ſimple Choler, or a ſalt Phlegm mixt with it,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> or that the Humours are made ſharp and corroſive from a hot and dry <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the Part affected, I leave others to judge: but in Bodies abounding with <hi>Cacochymia</hi> it is frequently ſeen, that an <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> ariſeth in the Noſe and Face from a ſmall Wart or fiery Puſtule, which being heated by ſcratching or picking with their Nails will terminate corroſive, and from an <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> become Phagedaenicall, and by a farther exaſperating cancerate; they differing but as the Humour becomes more or leſs fierce.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are evident from what hath been delivered of them.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> Some take their Originall from Abſceſſes deep in the Fleſh, others begin more ſhallow, and in time ſpread and eat, not onely the Skin to the Fleſh, but the Parts about, and diſſolve the Fleſh in the bottome of the Ulcer very ſenſibly.</p>
                     <p>All theſe kinds of corroſive eating Ulcers are accounted malign:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but ſome are leſs malign then other. Thoſe which ariſe in venerall Diſeaſes are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95669:106"/>difficult of Cure; but by reaſon of the Specificks that Diſeaſe hath for its help, they become eaſy. The other are extream difficult, and do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terminate cancerous.<note place="margin">Cure.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Ulcers a good Diet ought to be preſeribed, to prohibit the increaſe of ſharp Humours. The Body is alſo to be purged, the Humours contemperated, and the Matter to be diverted by Revulſion, Dervication and Interception, if it be poſſible. The virulent Humour affecting the Ulcer requires to be dried up, and the <hi>Intemperies</hi> to be corrected. But foraſmuch as theſe Ulcers differ one from another in their corroſive quality, the Medicaments muſt accordingly vary. If the <hi>Intemperies</hi> be hot, and the Ulcer corroſive, your Applications are to be cold and dry, with ſome little aſtringency; as <hi>unguent. tutiae, è plumbo, de calce, &amp; de lithargyro.</hi> If theſe anſwer not expectation, you muſt proceed with more ſtrong Medicaments. But by the authority of the Ancients you muſt ſcarify theſe Ulcers, or ſome way provoke them to bleed, that the ſharp Humours may thereby be diſcharged. Then waſh them with ſome drying Medicaments, which may alſo reſtrain the Influx of the Humours; as <hi>aq. calcis, aeruginoſa,</hi> or <hi>aluminoſa,</hi> or a <hi>Decoct. plantag. equiſeti, rubi, flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ. gallar.</hi> in a Chalybeate water. After which the Ulcer may be ſprinkled with any of theſe, <hi>pulv. tutiae praeparatae, corn. cervi uſti, pulv. oſtreor. combuſt. cort. granat.</hi> Or they may be made into Unguents, as thus; ℞ <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>bol. Armen. ſang. dracon. balauſt. an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ol. roſ. q. ſ. Miſc.</hi> a Compreſs being applied wet over all, wrung out of ſome aſtringent Decoction. The Ulcer thus dreſſed is not to be opened again in three or four days: for in theſe Ulcers the temperament of the Part is weak, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent expoſing it to the Air rendreth it more weak, and the Medicaments leſs effectuall.</p>
                     <p>But if this Ulcer be with Rottenneſs and Putrefaction, you are to proceed with Detergents, as <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. Merc. praecipitat. pulv. Andronis, Muſae,</hi> alſo Cauſtick and actuall Cautery. To theſe Applications Objections have been made; and, but a little above, Medicaments are by my ſelf propoſed drying without Eroſion: but when thoſe take no place, we proceed to ſtronger; and where there is Putrefaction, you will find uſe for the ſtrongeſt ſort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, as the actuall Cautery, it not onely ſerving to remove the corroſive Fleſh, but to check the malignity, and ſtrengthen the weak Part. But in caſe that will not be admitted of, you muſt proceed with the other, and the while defend the parts about with refrigerants, and after ſeparation of the corrupt Fleſh, treat it by Sarcoticks and Epuloticks, as hath been elſewhere ſaid.</p>
                     <p>A Man aged ſixty odd years, of a lean dry Habit of body,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of an Ulcer hard of Cure.</note> had a long time been troubled with an Ulcer on the inſide of the Ancle on his right Leg: it had been often cured, but it broke out again ſoon after. I found the Ulcer ſanious, the Parts about it ſwelled and livid, and endeavoured to cure it by the common method ſet down in the generall Cure of Ulcers; but it would not digeſt two days together. I then propoſed a laced Stocking: but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied there was no need, his Rowler kept off the Swelling. Obſerving him to be ſo very wiſe, I omitted my accuſtomed attendance, upon which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed another, who found much difficulty in it. Whether he cured it or no, I do not know; but about half a year to more after, the Patient ſent for me again. The Ulcer was undigeſted, and the Fleſh in it ſoft and rotten, of a florid colour, and the Parts about it as it were bruiſed; which proceeded from the frequent Fluxion and unequal ſtrict Bandage. I propoſed a laced Stocking which he willingly permitted. Mean time I deterged the Ulcer with <hi>Merc.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95669:106"/>praecipitat.</hi> applied Pledgits of <hi>unguent. baſilicon mag.</hi> over it, with an Emplaſter of <hi>cerat. Galeni,</hi> Compreſs and Bandage. The ſecond day after I fomented the Ulcer and Parts affected with a diſcutient and aſtringent Decoction, and digeſted it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> After I had thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and deterged the Ulcer, and rarefied the impacted Humours in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Parts, I fomented it with <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> applied Pledgits dipt in the ſame over the ends of the Ulcer, and dreſſed the middle with Compreſs, and laced on a ſtreight Stocking; by which the Fluxion was moderately reſtrained, and the Ulcer diſpoſed to cicatrize: yet through the acrimony of the Humour, and the indiſpoſition of the Lips and adjacent Parts, the work was not without ſome difficulty, the Matter being apt to ſhut in and bring part of the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> with it. But it was cured in leſs then two months ſpace; whereas without that Stocking it would ſcarce have cured in ſix months. It was uſually painfull after it had been cured by former methods, but was now free.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about fifty years of age, much ſubject to the Gout,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an Ulcer of hard cure.</note> having long laboured of a ſoar Leg, ſent for me. There was one large Ulcer with callous Lips on the inſide of the Small of his leg, with an Ulceration down below the Ancle. This Leg had been formerly ſubject to pituitous Swellings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the endeavouring to reſiſt the Influx had impacted the Matter, and made the Tumour ſcirrhous. The Ancle-joynt was ſtiff, and the Knee as bad, by reaſon of a contraction in the Ham. Upon theſe conſiderations the Soars were of difficult Cure. I dreſſed the larger Ulcer, which was ſordid, with Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate and <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> the leſſer with <hi>unguent, è plumbo,</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage, and againſt the next Dreſſing provided a Fomentation of red Wine with Stipticks, hoping that way to cicatrize the leſſer Ulcers at leaſt: but they would not cure ſo, for the indurated Parts required to be made ſoft, and the Matter to be diſcuſſed firſt: but this was a hard task, while the Patient laboured under the Gout, or pain from the weakneſs and indiſpoſition of the Parts. Therefore, having deſigned a Fomentation <hi>ex rad. &amp; fol. althaeae, malvae, parieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, ſem. lini,</hi> &amp;c. I bathed the Leg as it was held over the Liquour, continued my Applications to the Ulcers, and applied <hi>cerat. dialthaeae</hi> over the ſcirrhous Parts; continuing this method till I had relaxed the hardneſs. Then I put on a laced Stocking, by which I ſtrengthened the Part againſt the Influx, and uſed all my endeavours to cicatrize the Ulcers, by Pledgits preſt out of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Liquours applied upon Lawns, alſo by epulotick Unguents, Powders, and <hi>Malagma:</hi> but as faſt as I healed them in one place, they brake out in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that with much difficulty I cicatrized them at laſt by the help of a laced Stocking.</p>
                     <p>A Maid of about ſeventeen or eighteen years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of an Ulcer difficult of cure.</note> with an Ulcer in her right Leg about a hand's breadth on the inſide near the Ancle, deſpairing of Cure, ſent for a Woman who had ſome credit in the curing ſuch Ulcers. She came, and ſeeing a foul Ulcer with thick hard Lips, applied a Cauſtick to it, I ſuppoſe <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> It put the Patient to grievous pain for the ſpace of a day and night, cauſing great Inflammation and Tumour. Upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the Woman was ſent for again. She ſaw the effects of her Medicine, and would have applied ſomewhat to eaſe the pain: but the Patient's Friends ſeeing the diſturbance in the Ulcer, and doubting whither it might tend, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now to put her into the hands of a Chirurgeon, and ſent for me. I came, and found the Leg ſwelled, and the Eſcar large covering the Ulcer, and taking in the callous Lips round. It was ſo thick and deep, that I much feared it would leave the Bone bare under it. My work was to haſten the ſeparation
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95669:107"/>of the Eſcar, and mitigate the Accidents of pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which purpoſe I fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Part affected with Milk, dreſſed the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilicon cum ol. liliorum,</hi> and applied <hi>cerat. Galeni,</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Thus in few days the pain ceaſed, and the Eſcar ſeparated, leaving a Fleſh of a colour as it were bruiſed. I dreſſed the Ulcer with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. far. hord.</hi> &amp;c. and fomented the Tumour and Ulcer with <hi>Decoci. abſinth. flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. then applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> as an Empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with Bandage. After Digeſtion, I incarned with <hi>mel deſpumat.</hi> &amp;c. and continued the uſe of the Fomentation, hoping thereby to give a breathing, and dry up the bruiſed Parts with made that lividity about the Ulcer, and were the cauſe of its difficult curing. As the Ulcer incarned, I endeavoured by Bandage to keep the Lips flat to cicatrize with the Ulcer, and to that purpoſe dreſſed them and the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. è calce,</hi> touching the lax Fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, to dry it, and fit it to cicatrize, and with much pleaſure cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized it to the compaſs of a Silver peny, and thought the work very eaſy. But, when I leaſt ſuſpected it, the Skin crack'd in the ſound edges, and the Fleſh in the Ulcer looked of a dark red colour. I dreſſed it with Epuloticks, hoping it would yet cicatrize: but the <hi>Cuticula</hi> afterwards crack'd in three places more, and the Patient ſuſpected the cauſe to be from a fault in the Bone; as in truth I ſhould my ſelf have doubted it, if I had not ſeen the ſeparation of that Eſcar; for the Fleſh appeared rotten under the broken <hi>Cuticula,</hi> and as the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer healed in one corner, it broke out again there, or in another place. But this was from the <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Part, and required again to be digeſted before I could hope to cicatrize it. To which purpoſe I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> and Praecipitate, let her bloud, purged and vomited her, preſcribed her a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> put on a laced Stocking, and uſed my utmoſt endeavours to cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize it, as in ſuch Ulcers I was accuſtomed to doe; but all to no purpoſe, the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> would not hold two days. I then left off the uſe of the laced Stocking, and deſired the Patient once more to give me leave to try whether it would cure without it; and to that purpoſe perſwaded her to keep her Leg upon a Stool levell with her Body a few days, I hoping thereby to keep off Fluxion, and ſuppoſing, if I could once more breath out that groſs Bloud impacted in the Part, I ſhould be able to cicatrize the Ulcer; and if the Ulcer were cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized without Bandage, it would be the more laſting. I repeated the Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, digeſted the Ulcer, and with a Solution of the Tincture of Vitriol in a <hi>Decoct. equiſeti,</hi> &amp;c. applied Pledgits over bits of fine Lawn, and ſmeared the edges of the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> that it might not adhere to them. With ſuch like endeavours I cicatrized it firm, then put on a laced Stocking again, with a Compreſs under it ſpred with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> moderately to dry the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and dreſſed it once it two or three days for fear of the worſt. A dry Scale aroſe upon it doe what I could. I anointed it with <hi>Pomatum</hi> to ſupple it; then raiſed it lightly up, and took it off: and ſo I did two or three times, and at laſt left it firm and naturall as the reſt, and ſo it continueth to this day.</p>
                     <p>This Ulcer from its continuation might be <hi>Annuum;</hi> from its difficulty of cure, <hi>Chironium,</hi> or <hi>Telephium;</hi> from its rottenneſs of the Fleſh, <hi>Noma;</hi> from its callous Lips, <hi>Calloſum;</hi> from its frequent cracking of the Skin after cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing, <hi>Dyſepulotum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I was paſſing one day through <hi>Brainford</hi> to <hi>London,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a <hi>Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daenous</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Ulcer.</note> I was deſired to ſee a poor Servant lying under an Abſceſs in his left Leg, the <hi>Criſis</hi> of a malign Fever. The Abſceſs poſſeſſed the outſide of his Leg, from the head of the <hi>Fibula</hi> to the Ancle, the Orifice being three fingers breadth below the ſaid <hi>Fibula.</hi> The Matter could not diſcharge it ſelf till it overflowed; therefore I applied a Cauſtick upon the lower part of the Tumour to give vent to it, and left him Dreſſings till
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95669:107"/>he ſhould be able to follow me. Some days after he came to Town: I viſited him, and found the lower Opening diſcharged the Matter well, as I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; but it was ſanious, and abounded in quantity more then was reaſonably to be expected from the Abſceſs. I endeavoured to deterge it with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi</hi> mixed with Praecipitate, and fomented the Part affected with a <hi>Decoct. abſinth, ſalviae, betonicae, flor. roſ. rubr. bacc. myrtill. balauſt.</hi> in red Wine; then applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> with a Compreſs wrung out of the Fomentation, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it up, and applied a Defenſative over the Knee to reſtrain the Fluxion: I alſo let him bloud, and purged him with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, rhabarb.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum ſyr. de ſpin. cervina.</hi> But finding the Ulcer would not deterge, I laid it open the whole length, and ſeeing it ſordid, filled it with <hi>pulv. Andronis,</hi> applying the Mundificative upon Doſſills between the Lips, with an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over all, and rowled it up. The third day after I dreſſed it again with the Mundifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as before, onely adding ſome <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> to it. This method I continued ſome days, rubbing the looſe Fleſh with a Vitriol-ſtone, dipping ſome of the Pledgits in Praecripitate, and applying it under ſome of the Lips of the Ulcer which was undigeſted; then cut off ſome part of the Lips where they were very hollow and troubleſome, and put on a laced Stocking. Thus I deterged and diſpoſed the Ulcer to incarn under the Lips and elſewhere; and that it might doe ſo, I put the Patient into a Traumatick Decoction, and vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and purged him as occaſion offered. But after ſome days, obſerving the Lips of the Ulcer did not unite with the neighbouring Fleſh, nor the Ulcer contract as I expected, I made a ſearch with my Probe, and found the Fleſh, which was ſeemingly good, to be ſoft, and the Lips hollow and thin, and in ſome part callous. I dreſt them with that <hi>unguent. aeruginis, Cadmiae,</hi> &amp;c. as it is ſet down in Ulcers with moiſt <hi>Intemperies,</hi> rubb'd the callous Lips with the Cauſtick-ſtone, and applied <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> to haſten the ſeparation of the Eſcar; ſuppoſing by theſe drying Medicaments to diſpoſe the Ulcer to Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But as they incarned and cicatrized in one end or part, the Fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſoft and rotten in another, and here and there the Lips were hollow, which I cut off, and thereby freed the Ulcer of them; and by the help of the former Sarcoticks I incarned it again: but frequently in the cicatrizing ſome part of the Ulcer would be corroded from the acrimony of the Humour, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I was neceſſitated to dreſs this Ulcer with various Medicaments. In ſome parts of it I applied Pledgits in drying Waters, as <hi>aq. calcis, lapidis medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentoſi,</hi> and Epulotick Unguents, to cicatrize it; while in ſome others I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Detergents, yea and Digeſtives in others; and was not wanting the while by Mercuriall Remedies and good Diet to contemperate the acrimony in the bloud: yet was it a moſt hard and difficult work. My Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was my Aſſiſtent in the dreſſing of him, and ſaw this Ulcer with much adoe cured: but he continued the uſe of a laced Stocking for ſome while after.</p>
                     <p>Such an ill-conditioned Ulcer affected the Thigh of a Gentleman of about fifty years of age, of a full Body:<note place="margin">5.

The Ulcer was of the compaſs of a Five-ſhilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, but lay onely in the Skin, extreamly corroſive, with Lips ſtanding ſtiff up round the Ulcer: and although I took them down with Cauſtick, yet they aroſe again in the ſame form; and, being in a place difficultly managed by Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, would not cicatrize, but thruſt out in the middle little hard Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of red Fleſh like pins heads, which increaſing grew bigger, firſt one, then another. While I was endeavouring to deterge theſe Excreſcences, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came callous, united with one another, and made an unequall <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my endeavours by the Cauſtick-ſtone to rub down thoſe that roſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95669:108"/>higher then their fellows. At laſt it joined it ſelf to the Lips round, making a firm and hard <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> which after ſome while caſt off a dry Scurf, and became ſoft as the naturall Skin.</p>
                     <p>In the year after the great Plague I was ſent by Sir <hi>Fran. Prujean</hi> to a Gentleman of about fifty years of age,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat.</note> of a lean dry Habit of body, labouring under a corroſive Ulcer, running from the left ſide of the upper Lip near that Noſtrill, cloſe along by the Noſe, to the great <hi>Canthus</hi> or Corner of the Eye, penetrating the Skin here and there deeper then elſewhere: it ſpred alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the edges of the Ulcer, making as it were a double furrow alongſt the ridge and ſide of the Noſe ſuperficially in the Skin. Theſe latter did not matter much, nor were they very painfull. His Phyſician had purged him with an <hi>infuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenae, rhabarb.</hi> and the like, in which were diſſolved <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>ſyr. de pomis purg.</hi> and put him into a <hi>Decoct. ſarſae, Chinae, corn. cervi, eboris, ſantal.</hi> with vulnerary Herbs, alſo purged him once in four or five days with <hi>calomel.</hi> and <hi>reſina jalap. cum Elect. lenitiv.</hi> And thoſe days he did not purge, he took <hi>ceruſſ. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonii in confect. Alkermes,</hi> with <hi>pulv. corallii &amp; perlar.</hi> &amp;c. I began my Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <hi>cum unguent. tutiae Vig.</hi> with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> upon Pledgits in ſome parts where there wanted Digeſtion, and in others with <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> ſimple, and applied <hi>unguent. Comitiſſ.</hi> over all. The next day I took off the Dreſſings, ſomented the affected Parts with a <hi>Decoct. fol. plantag. roſ. rubr. balauſt. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach &amp; aluminis</hi> in Wine, and continued to dreſs the deeper Ulcers with the <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> The other, which were more ſuperficiall, I ſprinkled <hi>cum pulv. è corn. cerv. uſt. balauſt. &amp; croc. Martis aſtring.</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>unguent. Comitiſſae</hi> over all. By this method I dried up the upper Ulcer on the ſide of the Noſe, but the <hi>Cicatrices</hi> were unſeemly, as in moſt ſuch rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Ulcers they are, we being glad to dry them on any faſhion as we may. The other Ulcers alſo fill'd up with Fleſh, and afterwards cicatrized in ſome parts. The deepeſt Ulcers were alſo well diſpoſed to it. The ſeaſon of the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, the Patient retired into the Country, taking the foreſaid Medicaments with him, they agreeing well with the Ulcer. His Wife, having often dreſſed him in Town, knew how to apply them, and dreſſed him in the Country, where he continued all the Summer. He not giving us the leaſt account of his Ailment, I concluded him cured: but in the Fall of the leaf he returned, and then I found the Ulcer much exaſperated, and diſcharging a virulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it having corroded deep the whole length from his upper Lip along the Cheek into the great <hi>Canthus</hi> dividing the lower Lid of the Eye, and was paſſing between the <hi>Glandula lacrymalis</hi> and the Eye: it had alſo ſpred beneath into that Noſtrill, and had paſſed its Matter through; and in truth the caſe was moſt deplorable; for whatever theſe Ulcers may bear of ſharp Medicaments in another Part, here they would not: and poſſibly this was exaſperated by ſuch in the Country amongſt thoſe buſy-bodies. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recover it by Lenients powerfully drying without acrimony, ſuch as I had formerly uſed in the like caſe, and waſh'd the Ulcer with a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Salt drawn off from the flowers of Antimony <hi>in aq. veronicae.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Prujean</hi> was again conſulted, and Doctour <hi>Bate,</hi> alſo Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> and other Chirurgeons. The Phyſicians repeated the former courſe, with ſome additions, and ſweat him, and after that preſcribed him a Diet of Milk, which he lived ſtrictly upon a long time. Many Topicks were propoſed by us, but they were onely drying Medicaments without acrimony, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed well with the Ulcer, and thoſe ſerved onely to palliate it. Whilſt I attended it, the Ucler ſpred it ſelf under that Eye, fretting off the Muſcles ſo that the Eye was drawn by the contrary Muſcles to the externall <hi>Canthus,</hi> and diſtorted ſo as it was eaſy to ſee the Optick Nerve. I was not able to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95669:108"/>ſerve him. He lived under Palliation till within this twelvemonth. The Humour afterwards affected the other ſide: what progreſs it made there I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of an <hi>Herpes exedens.</hi>
                        </note> of a ſanguine Complexion and Plethorick, came to me with an <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> affecting the Eye-lids. It had been of ſome years growth: it began on the middle of the upper Eye-lid near the <hi>Cilia</hi> or edge in a ſmall Puſtule, (as it is deſcribed in the Chapter of thoſe Tumours,) and in continuance ſpred along the edge to the externall <hi>Canthus,</hi> where it eat deeper into the Skin, and by eroſion cauſed an Ulcer of a round figure the breadth of a Silver-peny, eating into the corner of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana conjunctiva,</hi> and thence the length of the lower Eye-lid, conſuming it downwards, leaving the neighbouring Parts ſcirrhous. Its Eroſion in theſe Parts was increaſed by the continual Fluxion from the inflamed Eye: for the upper Lid where the <hi>Herpes</hi> firſt aroſe was not ſo much concerned, the original <hi>Herpes</hi> lying there not unlike a <hi>hordeolum.</hi> Upon view of this Ulcer I deſired a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to that purpoſe Doctour <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> met me. <hi>Collyria</hi> of a refrigerant and exſiccant quality were preſcribed, Venaeſection in the Arm, Purging with <hi>decoct. epithymi,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſecond day after the external Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar was opened, and about ten ounces of bloud was taken: Fontanells were alſo made <hi>inter Scapulas,</hi> &amp;c. a Seton was alſo adviſed. The Patient thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted took a Journey upon extraordinary occaſions into the Country. About a month after he returned, and put himſelf again into my hands. I treated the Ulcer with Epuloticks of various ſorts and forms, applied Frontalls to intercept the deſcent of Humours, purged him with <hi>Calomel. cum rhabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baro,</hi> preſcribed Vulneraries in a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lign. lentiſcin.</hi> &amp;c. with Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamicks to contemperate the acrimony of the Humours. This method not ſucceeding, we conſulted a Phyſician, who preſcribed cooling Juleps of diſtill'd Milks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he growing hereby indiſpoſed in his Stomack, and the Ulcer raging, he returned to his former Preſcriptions; and by the taking <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> thoſe days he intermitted Purging, and by the application of <hi>unguent. calaminar.</hi> he was reſtored to better health, and the Ulcer more ſedate: upon which he ſupplied himſelf with ſome of the ſame internall and externall Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and retired into the neighbouring Country. About ſix weeks after he ſhewed himſelf to me. The Ulcer in and near the externall <hi>Canthus</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cicatrized, and the other Parts well diſpoſed. He then recruited himſelf with more of the ſame Medicaments, ſince when I have not ſeen him; but hear it increaſed in the Country, and he hath almoſt loſt the fight of that Eye.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with</hi> Varices.</head>
                     <p>WE have already treated of <hi>Varix</hi> as it affects the Thigh, Leg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have there ſhewed you that it is a Dilatation of the Veins with groſs Bloud: we alſo have there delivered the Cauſe and Signs, and how it differs, as dilating ſome one Vein, or all the branches of that Vein to the very Capillaries; and ſo the <hi>Varix</hi> may lie deep between the Muſcles and Skin, or more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially. I have alſo there ſhewed the advantage and diſadvantage that may happen in repreſſing them. It remaineth now that I ſay ſomewhat of them as they are ulcerated by the acrimony of the Humour, or by ſome accident of Bruiſe, Wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they become painfull, inflame, and ſwell the Member.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Ulcers with <hi>Varix</hi> are real, or palliative.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> The Real or perfect Cure propoſed by the Ancients I have delivered to you in the Chapter of a <hi>Simple Varix:</hi> it is by making an Inciſion in the Skin, and taking up the Vein and tying it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this way hath not been admitted (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) amongſt us; nor have I often ſeen that a Varicous Ulcer could be cured by cutting off the branch leading to the Ulcer, there being commonly more Veins concerned in it.</p>
                     <p>The Palliative Cure conſiſts in dreſſing the Ulcer with Digeſtives and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſives, according as the Ulcer is ſanious or ſordid, and the while by good Bandage or a laced Stocking to repreſs the Humours impacted in the Part; by which Bandage the Lips of the Ulcer are diſpoſed to cicatrize with the Ulcer. I call this method Palliative, for that it commonly laſts no longer then the laced Stocking is worn. In the Cure of theſe Ulcers, if there be <hi>Plethora,</hi> it may be neceſſary that the Body be purged, and a Vein opened.</p>
                     <p>A Woman of a full Body, aged 54 years, was grievouſly pained with an Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration on her right Leg.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat.</note> Severall Medicaments had been ineffectually applied. I being conſulted ſaw the Ulceration large, and the Capillary Veins lie dilated ſuperficially in the Skin; from whence I judged the Ulceration to ariſe. The Leg was much ſwelled, and ſomewhat inflamed. I dreſt the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration with <hi>unguent. tutiae Vigon.</hi> applied over it a mixture of <hi>unguent. nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> and <hi>populeon,</hi> rowled it up with Compreſs and Bandage, and beſpake a laced Stocking againſt the next day; which being then laced on, and the former method of Dreſſing repeated, the pain ceaſed from that day, and, the Humours being repreſſed by virtue of the Bandage, the Ulceration cicatrized in ten or twelve days.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1654.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> I was ſent for to an Inhabitant of this City, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his ſoar Legs, and that his Chirurgeon who uſed daily to dreſs them was lately dead: he deſired me I would ſupply his place, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would allow me the ſame Salary. I unrowled his Legs, and ſaw the Ulcers lying in the Skin in ſeverall places amongſt the <hi>Varices</hi> without Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or SWelling: but towards night they ſwelled, and were painfull. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the nature of his Diſeaſe, and propoſed the Cure by laced Stockings. I dreſſed the Ulcers with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> and rowled them up. Within a day or two his Stockings were brought him, and after I had dreſſed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95669:109"/>his Legs they were put on, with Compreſs under them upon the Ulcers. There were alſo pieces of Vellum laid between to defend them from the wrinkles of the Stockings. By the wearing of theſe the Humours were reſtrained, and the Ulcers diſpoſed well to cure. I made him a Fontanell in each Leg, and left him ſome Epuloticks to finiſh it, which they effected in few days. The Iſſues he continued to good purpoſe, for he is alive to this day.</p>
                     <p>A Nobleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of more then ſeventy years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a varicous Ulcer.</note> being diſeaſed here in Town with a large varicous Ulcer in the inſide of his left Leg, was commended to my hands by Sir. <hi>Fr. Prujean.</hi> The Ulcer reached from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to the Small of the leg deep amongſt the Fleſhy parts; it was crude and undigeſted. I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and Praecipitate, applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> ſpred as an Emplaſter with a Compreſs wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> and with good Bandage rowled it up from the Foot to the Knee. The next day I fomented it with a Decoction of <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. baec. myrtill. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> in Wine and Water; then dipt the Pledgits ſpred with <hi>baſilicon</hi> in Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and applied <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> as before, with Compreſs and Bandage. The third day I opened it again, and dreſſed it as before. The fourth day after, finding the Ulcer well deterged, I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> mixed with Praecipitate; and after I had digeſted it, put on a laced Stocking; then incarned with this, ℞ <hi>aloes &amp; thuris an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>asſae foetid.</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>mellis deſpumati</hi> ℥vj. <hi>Miſc. &amp; fiat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum.</hi> I afterward added a third part of <hi>unguent, è plumbo</hi> to one part of this Sarcotick, and by the help of the Vitriol-ſtone, and Pledgits dipt in a ſtiptick Wine, cicatrized the Ulcer. Mr. <hi>Pearce</hi> was his Lordſhip's Apothecary.</p>
                     <p>One having been troubled with a ſoar Breaſt about a year after Child-bed,<note place="margin">4.

It was hard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inflammation or diſcolouring in the Skin, and diſcharged a well-concocted Matter out of the Nipple and ſome ſmall Openings near it. I wondred what ſhould be the reaſon it did not cure. At laſt, in handling the Breaſt, I felt a <hi>Varix</hi> lying under the Skin: it felt like Network. I dreſſed the Ulcer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and others with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> applied <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over the Breaſt, with Bandage to ſupport it, and adviſed the wearing of fine Tow ſprinkled with Ceruſe under that <hi>Axilla:</hi> by which method it was afterwards cured in a month's ſpace or thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>The laſt year, while I was putting theſe Obſervations of Ulcers with <hi>Varices</hi> together,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of a varicous Ulcer with great tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> a poor Woman was brought to me out of the Country, ſuſpected to have the <hi>King's Evill</hi> in one of her Legs. The Swelling was great, and the Ulcer large and ſordid. In handling of it, I felt the Veins dilated under the Skin in the Fleſhy parts of the Leg from the Gartering to the Ancle, by which it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Ulcer was varicous; upon which account I undertook it <hi>gratis,</hi> and commended her to own of my Servants to cure, with directions to keep her Chamber, and that he ſhould the while foment and dreſs her Leg after the ſame method ſet down in the former Obſervations, and by Bandage diſpoſe it for a laced Stocking. Accordingly he fomented the Leg, dreſſed the Ulcers with Deterſives, and with Compreſs and Bandage rowled it moderately ſtreight from the Foot to the Gartering. After he had thus rarefied the pituitous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which were impacted in the Part, and deterg'd the Ulcer, he laced on a ſtreight Stocking with a Compreſs upon the Ulcer, by which the bloud was ſtreightned in its paſſage, and the Humours repreſt, alſo the Lips of the Ulcer were brought even and cicatrized in few weeks without Purging or Bleeding, and this prodigious ſwelled Leg was reduced to its naturall ſtate. Thus may the greateſt Swelling accompanying varicous Ulcers be removed, and the Ulcers palliated, if not cured: for it is confeſſed that they return again for the moſt part upon the diſcontinuing the laced Stocking.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of Sinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</head>
                     <p>HItherto I have treated of Ulcers which take their names from the Humours which affect them: I ſhall now diſcourſe of that Ulcer which derives its name from its hollowneſs, and is called a <hi>Sinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sennertus</hi> places the Chapter of <hi>Sinus</hi> next to that of a <hi>Phlegmon:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> and indeed they frequently ariſe from ſuch, eſpecially where the Orifice hath not been ſufficiently large to diſcharge the Matter: nay, in ſome great Abſceſſes, where the Cavity hath been very large, there, though the Aperture be great, yet for want of good Compreſſion, and diſpoſition in the Humours, the Skin unites ſo unequally with the Fleſh underneath, that it maketh ſeverall <hi>Sinus's,</hi> and doth as it were <hi>cuniculos agere,</hi> make Coney-burrows. Sometimes Abſceſſes do ariſe from within, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and paſs their Matter externally under the Arm-pits, or through the Back, Breaſt, or Sides; or from other <hi>Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> in the lower <hi>Venter,</hi> and raiſe Abſceſſes amongſt the external Muſcles of the <hi>Abomen,</hi> &amp;c. Of which I ſhall give you ſome Inſtances, having already occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally treated of the other ſort in a Treatiſe of <hi>Gun-ſhot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Antecedent Cauſe may be ill Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Humours exceed in quantity, or evill quality, and being too long retained in the Abſceſſe, get a corroſive diſpoſition, and render the Ulcer ſinuous.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Ulcers differ from one another, as they are either ſtraight, or crooked; deep,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> or lying onely under the Skin; or have one or more <hi>Sinus's.</hi> They may be diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> in that the latter is callous, which theſe are not, unleſs it be in the very Orifice.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of Sinuous Ulcers may be taken from the preceding Cauſes,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a tranſlation of Matter from within outward, or from Phlegmon, or other Abſceſs, Wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Sinus</hi> may alſo be judged by the ſearch of a Probe or Wax-candle. The quantity of Matter will alſo ſhew the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
                     <p>Sinuous Ulcers of long continuance are of difficult Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> by reaſon of the weakneſs of the native Heart in the Part, which rendreth it incapable of aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating its proper aliment, and ſubject to the receiving ſuperfluous Humours. Alſo if the <hi>Sinus</hi> run under the Joint, Nerves or Tendons, where it may not be ſafely laid open, the Cure is more hard to obtain.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sinus</hi> proceed from a tranſlation of Matter from within the body, you cannot hope to cure it till the diſeaſed <hi>Viſcera</hi> be healed, during which the Patient is in great danger of a <hi>Maraſmus;</hi> but if the ſinuous Ulcer diſcharge little Matter, and that well digeſted, and be in a place where it may ſafely be kept open, the Cure is hopefull.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of theſe Ulcers Authours have propoſed four Intentions.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> The firſt conſiſts in a regulation of Diet and the other Non-naturalls, accordingly as it hath been ſet down in the general Diſcourſe in this Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the Humours be evacuated and contemperated. If there be <hi>Plethora,</hi> the Evacuation will be neceſſary by Purging and Venaeſection. The contemperating of the Humours may be by Traumatick decoctions and other Balſamicks, as all along hath been propoſed.</p>
                     <p>The third is effected in prohibiting the Humours to flow into the Ulcer, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95669:110"/>that by Revulſion, Interception and Repulſion: which hath been ſufficiently ſpoken of in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Tumours</hi> in generall.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Intention concerns more immediately the Cure of the Ulcers, <hi>viz.</hi> by the removing of thoſe accidents of pain, inflammation, tumour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no hope of Cure. In order to this work, you muſt conſider the <hi>Sinus,</hi> how the Matter may be beſt diſcharged. If the Orifice be in the declining part, inlarge that: but if the <hi>Sinus</hi> run beneath downward, your beſt way will be to open that in the declining and loweſt part by Knife or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick; ſo ſhall the Sinuous Ulcer above be diſpoſed to cure. But if the <hi>Sinus</hi> do run under conſiderable Veſſells, or be in ſuch a place where you cannot ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay it open, you ought then to inlarge the Orifice, and put the Member in ſuch a poſition as may diſpoſe the Matter to flow forth, and by Compreſs and Bandage contribute your endeavours thereto. Having thus made way for the diſcharge of Matter, you are then to deterge the Ulcer with Medicaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the impurity of it. The moſt uſual are, <hi>unguent. Apoſtolor. mund. Paracelſ. &amp; ex apio:</hi> to which may be added <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> &amp;c. If there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Injections, you may with a Syringe caſt in ſome of theſe following Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours; but do not ſtop the Orifice the while, for thereby you will dilate the <hi>Sinus.</hi> The milder may be, a <hi>decoct. bordei, cum ſyr. de roſ. ſice. mell. magiſt. noſt.</hi> Or, ℞ <hi>ſummitat. centaur. min. agrimon. equiſeti, pimpinellae, an.</hi> Mj. <hi>rad. ariſtoloch. rot. rad. iridis, an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>myrrhae, ſarcocollae, an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>coq. in aq. font.</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr>ij. <hi>colat. adde ſpir. vini</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>mell. roſar. q. ſ.</hi> Other of this ſort you may ſee in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sinuous Ulcers in <hi>Gun-ſhot Wounds.</hi> If the Ulcer ariſe from ſome Abſceſs within the body, it will not be ſafe to uſe Injections, till you can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your ſelf how they will come out again. Therefore in ſuch caſes you muſt conſider, as above ſaid, how you may give a vent to the Matter: for while that is retained, there is no hope of deterſion. But that being conveniently made, you may keep it open by <hi>Cannula,</hi> or with a Pea threaded, as a Fontanell, till Nature ſhall be diſpoſed by the Phyſician's help to heal the internal <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and then the externall Ulcer will heal of it ſelf under the Pea, if you leave it not timely out.</p>
                     <p>During the Cure of all theſe Ulcers, you ought to uſe Fomentations diſcutient and drying proportionably as the caſe requireth; <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>ſummitat. abſinth. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joranae, hyperici, betonicae, flor. cham. roſ. rubr. balauſt. bacc. myrtill. nuc. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ.</hi> &amp;c. in Wine and Water, with the addition of Brandie.</p>
                     <p>A Married Woman aged thirty four years,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer in the Leg.</note> having layn a great while lame with a pain in her right Leg, ſuppoſed a <hi>Rheumatiſmus,</hi> after frequent bleeding, purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſwelled on the outſide from the Gartering to the Heel, and diſcharged its Matter near the Ancle. Some neigbouring Chirurgeon and Apothecary were imployed, who dreſſed it and preſcribed her Phyſick accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and after ſome time permitted the Ulcer to cloſe, endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her ſhe was cured. But it ſwelling ſoon after with Inflammation, I was ſent for, and ſaw the Ulcer near cloſed: but the quantity and ill quality of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhewed it ſinuous; and upon ſearch I diſcovered it ſo to the very Gartering, alſo a <hi>Sinus</hi> running down towards the Heel. I dilated the Orifice with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian roots, applied a Cauſtick about an inch and a half in length upon the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> above, and gave vent to the Matter, dreſſing it up with Lenients, as <hi>unguent. baſilicon cum. ol. roſ.</hi> and after the fomenting it, applied <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and Bandage, ſuppoſing the Matter would be intercepted, and the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's</hi> beneath thereby diſpoſed to cure. But after ſeparation of this Eſcar, the Ulcer appeared hollow under the lips; and the Matter flowing from the remaining <hi>Sinus</hi> above, put me upon a neceſſity of laying that open by a Snip
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95669:111"/>with a pair of Sciſſors: and after all my endeavours, I was glad to lay open the lowermoſt <hi>Sinus,</hi> from the Ancle downwards, before I could diſpoſe it to cure. The ſeveral Cavities being laid open, I dreſſed them with Digeſtives, Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives and Epuloticks, accordingly as they required, then cheriſhed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat in the Member by good Fomentations, as above in the method of Cure is ſet down; and by Intercipients and Bandage reſtrained the influx of Humours.</p>
                     <p>To adde to this poor Woman's miſery,<note place="margin">Caution in making Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanells.</note> ſhe had a Fontanell formerly made upon the Tendon of the <hi>Biceps,</hi> which had cauſed a contraction of her Arm, and a hard Tumour on the inſide of the <hi>Radius,</hi> with great pain and convulſion in her Hand and Fingers. This very pain kept her watching day and night, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly exhauſted her ſpirits, and put ſuch a Ferment in her bloud, as it ſeemed to me difficult to cure her Leg whilſt this diſturbance continued on her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began with the Embrocation of the Arm, and ſo downwards, with this; ℞ <hi>unguent. nervin.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ol. lumbric.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ol. vulpin.</hi> ℥j. <hi>ol. origani, lavend. ana q. ſ.

She was alſo purged once a week with <hi>Calomel.</hi> and at other times took <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timon. diaphoret.</hi> &amp;c. Thus I reſolved the Tumour in her Wriſt, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of her Arm, and reſtored the uſe of her Hand: during which the Ulcers in her Leg digeſted, incarned and cicatrized, according to the method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the generall Chapter of <hi>

                     <p>A Maid-ſervant,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the right Breaſt.</note> aged twenty ſix years, had a ſmall Phlegmon on a part of her right Breaſt tending to Suppuration. I, ſuppoſing it ſimply ſuch, confidently undertook the Cure; and having ſuppurated it by the application of <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> open'd it by Cauſtick, and diſcharged a purulent Matter; which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing daily with diminution of the Inflammation and Tumour, I made a ſearch with a Probe, and penetrated into the cavity of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> I then diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with her, informed my ſelf that ſhe had been long diſeaſed with a Cough and frequent Shortneſs of breath. I was much aſhamed of my confident under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it. The rarity of the caſe deceived me, and as many as afterwards ſaw it, every one judging the Ulcer ſimple. But its penetrating (as I ſaid) ſhewed the Cure difficult, and the work of time. Therefore I fitted it with a <hi>Cannula,</hi> which I retained with a ſnip of Plaiſter, and applied a thin piece of Sponge preſt out of Wine upon it, with Compreſs and Bandage over it, directing the dreſſing it twice aday. After I had thus healed up the reſt of the Ulcer, I left out the <hi>Cannula,</hi> put in a Pea, and kept it as a Fontanell, till Nature ſhould diſpoſe the <hi>Viſcera</hi> within to a better condition. But ſhe, growing hecticall, removed into the Country with internal Preſcriptions and directions to dreſs her ſelf; where I ſuppoſe ſhe is ſince recovered of her Fever.</p>
                     <p>Some while ſince I was accidentally conſulted in the Country by a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon there about an apoſtemated Breaſt,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of an Ulcer penetrating the Breaſt.</note> the biggeſt I ever ſaw. The Patient was a Woman of about forty years old: ſhe had a Cough, and was oppreſt with Difficulty of breathing. The Chirurgeon opened her Breaſt in the declining part, and diſcharged a proportionable quantity of foetid Matter. She was ſomewhat relieved by it; but it penetrated into the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and the large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Matter ſoon waſted her.</p>

                     <p>A Child of about four years of age was brought to <hi>London,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of Sinuous Ulcers on the left Sid penetrating.</note> ſuppoſed to have the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi> It had three Ulcers lying near one another on his left Side, between the two lowermoſt of the true Ribs: they were accompanied with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Excoriation. He was much emaciated, and afflicted with a Cough and Shortneſs of breath. Upon ſearch with a ſmall Wax-candle into the upper Orifice, I penetrated between the Ribs, and felt the edge of the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt foul. The other Ulcers were made by the inſinuation of the Matter for want of timely inlarging the firſt Orifice. I dreſt the Excoriation with <hi>unguent. album camph. &amp; cerat. Galeni,</hi> and applied ſome of the mild Cauſtick, by which I inlarged thoſe Orifices. After the ſeparation of the Eſcars, I dreſſed the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and cured them. The uppermoſt I kept open as a Fontanel with a Pea, for diſcharge of the Matter from within, not concerning my ſelf in the exfoliation of the Bone, but leaving that to Nature, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fails where the Ulcer is kept well digeſted. During my proceeding thus with the Ulcers, the Child was preſcribed a Decoction of <hi>Sarſa</hi> with Pectoralls, and his body kept open with <hi>ſyr. de rhab. in aq. germ. querc.</hi> ſomewhat of <hi>Calomel.</hi> was alſo preſcribed, <hi>ceruſſa Antimonii,</hi> &amp;c. and the Child recovered. But while the Attendants grew ſecure and careleſs in dreſſing the Ulcer, the Pea ſlipt out, and the Orifice cloſing in the Matter, he was ſeized with a Cough, Difficulty of breath, and Fever. Upon which account I open'd that Ulcer again, and relieved him. He went ſoon after into the Country, and by the foreſaid method re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about forty years of age labouring under a Fever in the Country,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer in the Breaſt.</note> it terminated in ſome Abſceſs within the Breaſt, and paſſed its Matter at laſt into the right <hi>Axilla,</hi> raiſing a large Abſceſs there, which, being left to Nature, made its way through the Skin; but not having Opening ſufficient nor timely, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invaded the <hi>interſtitia</hi> of the Muſcles, and ſpred it ſelf over all the Breaſt and Side, and did not diſcharge it ſelf outwardly otherwiſe then as it overflowed: by which means the Abſceſs became very large, and the quantity of Matter had wel-nigh exhauſted the Patient. It was my chance to come into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and being deſired to give him a viſit, and ſeeing the cauſe of it, I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a long Inciſion in the lower part of his Breaſt, and gave vent to the Matter; and afterwards made another Opening from the Ulcer in the <hi>Axilla</hi> downwards, where the Matter was ſtreightned by a hard <hi>Callus.</hi> In other parts, where the Matter was alſo contained, and could not be diſcharged by the former Openings, I applied Cauſticks, and the next day divided the Eſcars, thereby giving way to the remaining Cavities to empty themſeves. This being done, I left Medicaments and directions for the dreſſing them: <hi>viz. unguent. ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicon</hi> for Digeſtion; <hi>mundificat. Paracelſi, Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and Vitriol-ſtone for Deterſion; <hi>unguent. ſarcotic.</hi> to incarn; and <hi>unguent. tutiae &amp; deſiccativum rubr.</hi> for the cicatrizing the Ulcer. For whatever people pretend of Cure by Injections, the way is ſlow and hazardous, they often rendring theſe Ulcers more ſinuous, and being of uſe onely where the Ulcer may not be opened by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſiderableneſs of the place. Here in this caſe, after the Matter had free vent, the Ulcer cured moſt eaſily.</p>
                     <p>A Daughter of a ſubſtantial Citizen laboured under an Abſceſs in the Region of her left Kidney, and was long treated by a bold Empirick,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating the left Kidney.</note> who promiſed Cure: but after all his endeavours, the Child languiſhing under the Ulcer, ſometimes by reaſon of the great diſcharge of Matter by Urine, and othertimes through the ſuppreſſion of it, great pains were ſtirred up within the Body, and outwardly in the Abſceſs. I being conſulted, obſerved that the externall Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſs took its originall from the Ulcer within the Kidney, and required other manner of dreſſing, its Cure being the work of time. I propoſed the laying
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95669:112"/>it open to the very Part where the Matter paſſed forth from the Kidney. To which purpoſe I applied a Cauſtick upon the <hi>Sinus</hi> below, divided the Eſcar, and dreſſed it up with Lenients. Then after ſeparation and digeſtion of the Ulcer, ſearching the ſame with my Probe, I found the <hi>Sinus</hi> run up above the Orifice; which being alſo laid open, I diſcovered the paſſage into the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and felt the ſide of the laſt ſhort Rib bared by the Matter in its paſſing out. I dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>mundif. ex apio,</hi> and healed up the remaining <hi>Sinus's</hi> above and below to the very Aperture. While I was doing this work, Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> was conſulted to help us in the Cure by Internalls, who preſcribed a Traumatick decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> &amp;c. with the more temperate Plants, and Balfamick pills to contemperate the Humours. During my diſpoſing of this Ulcer to retain a <hi>Cannula,</hi> the Matter diſcharged by Urine in great quantity, and the Patient was as ſoarly afflicted, and had the ſame Symptome that others have who are diſeaſed with Ulcers or Stones in the Kidney; but after vent was given by a ſhort <hi>Cannula</hi> of Lead, ſhe recovered. Having continued the uſe of the <hi>Cannula</hi> ſome months, I removed it, and kept a Pea juſt in the Opening, and by red Sparadrope and Compreſs retained it on; then left her to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dreſs, and onely called ſome times when they gave me notice of their wants. After a year or thereabout that ſhe had kept this Fontanell open, the internall pains and diſcharge of Impurities ceaſed, and ſhe grew more fleſhy and ſtrong. She went alſo daily to a neighbouring School, where ſhe was exerciſed in Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the ſpace of two years or thereabout, the Ulcer ſeeming not to matter more then might be expected from a ſmall Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell, the Mother caſt out the Pea, and permitted it to heal up. But being ſoon alarm'd by the old Accidents which returned upon the Child, ſhe ſent for me. I opened it again, and left them to keep it ſo. Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> was alſo again conſulted, who repeated the former method with ſome little alteration. The Ulcer was afterward kept open near three years, during which ſhe repeated her courſe of Phyſick Spring and Fall, and was frequently brought to me. At length I ſeeing her well grown and of a fleſhy and healthy Complexion, and the Fontanell in a manner dried up, I adviſed them to throw out the Pea, it being of no uſe. They did ſo: from which time the Patient hath continued ſtrong and well, and is ſince married.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman of about ten or eleven years of age was afflicted with a Sinuous Ulcer on his right ſide of the Spine.<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the right Side.</note> It had taken its originall from a tranſlation of Matter ariſing from within his body whilſt he lay ſick of a Fever in the Country. It came at length to maturation, and was let out by a neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chirurgeon: but it proving difficult of Cure, he was brought to Town. He was hectick, and diſeaſed with a Cough and Shortneſs of breath, the Abſceſs mattering much, but eſpecially when he bowed his body downward, or lay in his bed upon the contrary Side; alſo in lying upon his Belly the Matter ran forth ſome ſpoonfulls, and upon holding his breath it blubbered forth, which ſhewed it came from within. Yet, for that ſometimes upon preſſing with our hands upon the Muſcles of that ſide the Spine, there diſcharged Matter, we were apt to think it lay originally between the Muſcles of that place. Doctour <hi>Micklethwait</hi> was conſulted, and entertained their Phyſician, and was often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the dreſſing the Patient. The Apertion was ſmall, and obſtructed by a <hi>Callus</hi> and luxurious fleſh within the Ulcer, whereby neither the Probe nor Wax-candle could make any conſiderable way. We were ſatisfied that there were more <hi>Sinus's</hi> then that tranſverſe the Back, yet by the ſearch of a Probe we could make no diſcovery: but about three days after a redneſs in the Skin ſhewed us a <hi>Sinus</hi> lying near the <hi>Os ilion</hi> of about two inches long, the Skin ſeeming thin. I opened it with a mild Cauſtick, and having divided the Eſcar,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95669:112"/>I paſſed in a Probe from thence towards the Spine: but that not ſatisfying me, I applied a Cauſtick upon the old Orifice, and another lower, whence I had preſſed out Matter. Then dividing them, I fill'd them with Praecipitate; and by rubbing into thoſe Eſcars afterwards with the Cauſtick-ſtone I penetrated into the <hi>Sinus's.</hi> One of theſe diſcharged the Matter which flowed that way; and the other ſerved our purpoſe to diſcover the <hi>Sinus</hi> penetrating under the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt falſe Rib towards the Breaſt; which I dilated, and by deterſion enlarged the paſſage, then fitted the Ulcer with a <hi>Cannula</hi> of Lead, with an Emplaſter, Compreſs and Bandage over it, by which the Matter diſcharged very well, and the Patient was relieved in his Cough, and recovered his appetite. The other Apertures, having emptied the externall <hi>Sinus's,</hi> were deterged and cured. After the uſe of the <hi>Cannula</hi> ſome days, perceiving looſe Fleſh to ariſe in the Ulcer, which hindred the diſcharge of Matter, and that the activeneſs of our Patient cauſed the <hi>Cannula</hi> frequently to ſtart out of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and ſometimes fit uneaſy, I left it out altogether, and put in a large Pea, with a Thread in it to pull it out at pleaſure. By this, with application of the common Sparadrope for Iſſues, this Ulcer was as a Fontanell kept open, and the Matter plentifully diſcharged thereby; his Habit of body was alſo by the Phyſician's preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Vulnerary decoctions and Balſamicks, with lenient Purgatives, ſo well reſtored, that he returned into the Country with his Parents. Some while after coming again to <hi>London</hi> with them, I gave him a viſit, and found him fat and well recovered. I did not ſee the Ulcer, but was aſſured from himſelf and his Servants, that it was kept open with much eaſe, and that it mattered but little. I adviſed then the keeping it ſo while any Matter flowed to the Part: which they did, and thereby cured him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>VARIX</hi> in generall hath been handled in one of the foregoing Treatiſes. But becauſe there is one ſort of <hi>Varices</hi> more important then the reſt, I mean the varicous Swellings of the <hi>venae haemorrhoïdales,</hi> I thought it convenient to diſcourſe of them particularly by themſelves. Theſe happen very often both in men and women, ſo as ſometimes to break and void bloud; other times onely to ſwell and diſtend. But the conſequences of theſe are very great, both as to the duration and intenſeneſs of the pain, and alſo as to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Ulcers that ariſe from them. Theſe Tumours are ſometimes phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monous, ſometimes ſcirrhous, ſometimes cancerous; many times they are ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous and fiſtulous.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore take occaſion from that Chapter of <hi>Varix,</hi> to adde in this place an intire Diſcourſe of the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> together with all the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are of the ſame kindred and family with them: in which if I ſwarve from that accuracy of method which Learned men may expect in the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parts of this Book, I hope the young Chirurgeon will at leaſt think that fault ſufficiently recompenſed by having all the troubleſome Diſeaſes of that Part brought at once into one view.</p>
                     <p>The perſpicuity of this Diſcourſe will depend much upon a true notion of the conſtitution of the <hi>Anus,</hi> or uttermoſt Exit of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum.</hi> In which place it is bound about with a Sphincter-Muſcle, the contraction of which ſhuts it ſo, as to detain within the Guts whatever Excrements fall down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95669:115"/>till ſuch time as Nature, being ſtimulated either by the fulneſs or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of matter, doth voluntarily relax it, and by the help of ſeveral pairs of Muſcles dilate it, to make way for the diſcharge. All theſe things put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make up that organicall Part which we call the <hi>Anus</hi> in a compound ſenſe; though in a ſtrict ſignification it denote onely the extremity of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> to which all theſe things belong, and for the motion of which they are all deſigned. Theſe Muſcles, and eſpecially the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> it ſelf, are fed by ſeverall Arteries. As, firſt, the <hi>Arteria meſenterica inferior,</hi> which, being almoſt wholly deſigned for the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> doth ſpread branches all over it copiouſly, and very particularly to that end which we call the <hi>Anus:</hi> and, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Arteria hypogaſtrica</hi> doth ſend branches to the <hi>Anus,</hi> but chiefly to the Muſcles belonging to it. Theſe Arteries bringing Bloud hither, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Veins deſtined for its return; one of which is the <hi>haemorrhoïdalis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> uſually ſo called, which is a branch of the Hypogaſtrick vein, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with its cognominall Artery. The other indeed moſt important Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is the <hi>haemorrhoïdalis interna,</hi> which receiving the Bloud from all the parts of the <hi>rectum,</hi> and eſpecially about the <hi>Anus,</hi> unites into a ſlender Trunk, which paſſing along the Gut by degrees creeps into the Meſentery, and uſually inſerts it ſelf up between the Meſentericall branches of the <hi>Porta,</hi> ſometimes into the right, ſometimes into the left, and ſometimes into the Trunk of the <hi>Porta.</hi> More rarely it forſakes this courſe, and is inſerted into the Splenick branch, ſometimes without, and ſometimes within the Spleen. This laſt caſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but ſeldome: yet ſurely it happened to thoſe that firſt conjectured this Vein to be the Evacuatour of the melancholick Humours of the Spleen. How elſe ſhould they gueſs that a Veſſell ſo viſibly inſerted either into the Trunk of <hi>Porta,</hi> or at leaſt into the Meſenterick branches, ſhould derive Humours rather from the Spleen then the Liver?</p>
                     <p>But ſince the doctrine of the Circulation hath quite taken away the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Hypotheſis, we are of late taught clear a new Leſſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Bloud deſcends hither onely by the Arteries, chiefly by the <hi>meſenterica inferior,</hi> by which being caſt into the middle and inward Coats of the Gut, it is carried back by the Vein aforeſaid. Now if any man ask me the reaſon of the frequent Tumours and Apertions of this Vein, I ſhall give him this account. Firſt, that it is ſet in a depending Part; which reaſon is common to it and the Legs, both of which are more ſubject to <hi>Varices</hi> then other parts of the Body. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Legs and all muſculous parts of the Body, when they receive Bloud into them, do contract themſelves more vigorouſly for the expulſion thereof, and promoting of its aſcent, then the Gut, which is a more lax part, and contracts with leſs force at all times, ſave when Nature aims at an expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; in which caſe the tendency of Nature is downwards, quite contrary to that of the motion of the Bloud, and rather hinders the return then furthers it, binding up the Bloud in its own Veſſells. Thirdly, the Veins hereabout are in themſelves ſo very ſmall that they have no Valves, ſo that Bloud being detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, is not ſo eaſily carried up or hindred from reſtagnation, as where Valves are frequent. Fourthly, the place is ſo often moiſtned by the frequent afflux of Humours, that it is very forward to increaſe the naturall Laxity of the Part, to dilate the Veſſells, and to provoke an afflux of Humours; by virtue of which ſometimes ſpongie Fleſh is thruſt out, and ſometimes Tumours of other natures generated. Fifthly, that theſe Veſſels being here not onely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but alſo cutaneous, ſcattered in a very thin tender Skin, are apter upon the impulſe of Bloud to fly open, then where they are bound in by a thick ſtrong cover: and for this reaſon the Noſe alſo (if it be ſeaſonable to ſpeak of it in this place) is apter to bleed then other parts.</p>

                     <p>The naturall conſtruction of the <hi>Anus</hi> being ſuch as I have deſcribed, the preternaturall may eaſily be inquired into. For if by any Fermentation or Ebullition of the Bloud any ſharpneſs ſo affect it as to cauſe a ſtagnation in this place, preſently the Veins, being not ſufficient for the diſcharge, grow varicous: and if the Humour by its ſharpneſs or thinneſs, or both, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Nature, by this means the <hi>rectum</hi> is always offering to ſqueeze and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf, and binds up the Vein ſo that the Bloud cannot aſcend, but is by the violence of the motion thruſt back again, to the burſting open of the mouths of the Veſſell. If the Coats be thick or apt to ſpongineſs, then the Parts ſwell, and either the Veſſels themſelves appear blew and in cluſters like Grapes, or elſe Fleſh groweth about them, and makes <hi>Ficus, Condylomata,</hi> and <hi>Criſta's.</hi> If the Humour be of a ſaline nature, it dries and parches the Skin, and chaps it; from whence comes <hi>Rhagades</hi> and <hi>Fiſſurae,</hi> things frequent in the Noſe and Lips as well as here.</p>
                     <p>This Humour is moſt frequently lodged within the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and ſo appears to the eye: but it likewiſe very often is lodged on the Muſcles near it, where the <hi>Varices</hi> are hidden, and ſeldome diſcover themſelves, but onely an outward Tumour appears which in progreſs often times apoſtemates, and at laſt ends in a fiſtulous Ulcer; which Ulcer, according to the duct of the Veſſells that feed it, ſometimes penetrates the Gut, and ſometimes not.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall firſt treat of the <hi>Varices</hi> themſelves, and the Tumours that are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to them; and then ſhall beg leave of my Reader to tranſlate hither a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the Ulcers of theſe Parts: which I ſhould have placed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Varices haemorrhoïdales</hi> themſelves will admit of theſe following <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;</hi> which are either eſſentiall, or accidentall.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Eſſentiall are thoſe that are taken from the Parts themſelves that are tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: <hi>viz.</hi> either the Vein onely ſwells, or ſome adjacent Bodies ſwell with it,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> or ſome new Body is generated that adheres to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Vein onely ſwells, then either it ſwells without bleeding, which we call <hi>Haemorrhoïdes caecas</hi> or blind Haemorrhoids; or, 2. upon ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it opens and bleeds, which we call <hi>Haemorrhoïdes apertas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When other Parts ſwell with the Vein, other Tumours ariſe, as Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Scirrhi,</hi> Cancers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are ſeated in the Muſcles of the <hi>Anus,</hi> or of the adjacent Parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When new Bodies are generated, they, according to their figure and ſubſtance, are called by ſeverall names, as <hi>Ficus, Condylamata,</hi> Warts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all of them Excretions upon the Veins ſo ſwelled.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Accidentall Differences are many: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. From the place; ſo they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, or externall. 2. From the bigneſs; great, or ſmall. 3. Number; one, or more. 4. Figure; round, as the <hi>Haemorrhoïdes caecae,</hi> or long, as the <hi>Ficus,</hi> and Warts, or triangular, as the <hi>Criſta.</hi> 5. Superficies; equall, or unequall. 6. The <hi>baſis;</hi> broad, or narrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. The Times; periodicall, or uncertain. Many other may be reckoned, as mens fancy leads them.</p>
                     <p>The Internall <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> muſt be either a meer <hi>Plethora,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> or a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymia.</hi> A mere <hi>Plethora</hi> is a rare caſe, and if ever it happens, ſooner affects other Parts then this. But a <hi>Cacochymia</hi> doth produce them ſometimes when it is plethorick, and then is commonly periodicall and breaks: or elſe when 'tis without a <hi>Plethora,</hi> the ſharpneſs of the Humour, or weakneſs of the Part, or both, do concurr to the production. So according to the variety of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the Humour variety of Tumours do ariſe: concerning which we have ſeverally treated already in their particular Chapters.</p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:95669:116"/>
                     <p>But they are not Internall Cauſes onely to which theſe Tumours owe their Originall, they have often Externall Cauſes; as biting of Leeches, pain any way cauſed by Blow, Bruiſe, Friction, or Puncture. So a man living near <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadilly</hi> in eating of Plaice ſwallowed a Bone, which in paſſing ſtuck in the <hi>Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num rectum,</hi> and ſtirred up pain. He adviſed with ſome, who applied Leeches, whereby the Fluxion was increaſed, and made an Abſceſs, which terminated in a ſinuous Ulcer. The Patient pulled out the Bone, and I was called in to the ſight of the Ulcer by the Chirurgeon, who was of my name and relation. So likewiſe there are many inſtances that demonſtrate the Piles to ariſe from Chirurgicall Operations and Applications. Likewiſe ſharp Humours paſſing near that place from the Guts do by their acrimony provoke the Piles. This Humour may be from internall Cauſes in the Bloud, and yet effects external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt paſſing out at the <hi>Anus,</hi> it makes the ſame affections there that a ſharp Clyſter would: or it may be excited by Aloeticall, Scammoniate, or other acrimonious Medicines.</p>
                     <p>After all this Diſcourſe it will be needleſs to ſay much of the <hi>Signs.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs.</note> Your eye will tell you whether it be a Vein or ſome other Tumour that you ſee; alſo whether the Part bleed or not. In other Tumours the Figure will tell you which is the <hi>Ficus, Morus, Criſta, Condyloma:</hi> the laſt of which is like a round penſile Wart with a narrow neck; if it be flat, it is <hi>Ficus;</hi> if it have a broad <hi>baſis,</hi> it is <hi>Criſta;</hi> and ſo forward; their names being given from their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances. <hi>Cancer, Phlegmon, Scirrhus,</hi> have their Signs taught in their proper Chapters.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> flow ſeaſonably and moderately,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> they purge the Body of feculent groſs Bloud, and thereby free it of many dangerous Diſeaſes, as Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, Inflammation of the Lungs and Kidneys, Quartane Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and reſtore health.</p>
                     <p>If they flow immoderately, the Patient groweth weak and faint, is ſubject to <hi>Cachexia,</hi> Dropſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo by the inordinate ſuppreſſion of them the Patient is rendred ſubject to all the forementioned Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>From all which it may be concluded, that there is not leſs danger in unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> then there is from their too great Evacuation; and that they are not unadviſedly to be provoked, nor yet too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to be checked.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> called <hi>caecae,</hi> or blind Piles, be extream painfull, and not timely ſuccoured, there is danger leſt, through the great concourſe of Humours, Inflammation, Apoſtemation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do follow.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> which affect that part next the Neck of the bladder are more vexatious, by reaſon of the conſent they have with it; whence Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Strangury may happen.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> called <hi>verrucales</hi> are the worſt ſort; the <hi>uvales</hi> are the milder, and the <hi>morales</hi> have a mediocrity between both.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> we ſhall begin with the <hi>caecae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure of the <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids;</hi> and firſt of the <hi>caecae,</hi> or blind Piles.</note> as well the externall as internall: in both which the Patient's Diet ought to be ſuch as hath virtue to keep the Body ſoluble; becauſe in theſe Diſeaſes they are generally coſtive, and by ſtraining to eaſe nature do onely excrete a <hi>Mucus;</hi> and if by ſuch excretions they do avoid Excrements, it is with much pain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pannado's, Barly-grewells, Oat-meal-caudle's and Broths of Veal, Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Beets, Spinage, Borage, Bugloſs, Endive, Succory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are proper. Their Drink may be a ſmall Ale, Beer, or Wine diluted with Water, or Ptiſans. Strong Drinks and Salt or ſharp Meats are hurtfull. The Body may alſo be kept ſoluble by Clyſters of fat Broths, emollient Decoctions, or of new Milk. They may be caſt up with Syringes which have a ſhort thick Pipe Taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95669:116"/>Lenient Purgatives are alſo of uſe, <hi>viz. Elect. diacathol. lenitiv. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prun.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If there be <hi>Plethora,</hi> or the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> be inflamed, Bleeding in the Arm is neceſſary, and in the Leg is you repeat it. If the Patient hath been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to a Flux of the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> and they are ſuppreſt, then Leeches may be applied, that the Bloud may have its diſcharge that way: but unleſs in the caſes aforeſaid Leeches ought not to be uſed, and then alſo cautiouſly,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drawing the Humours to the Part, then carrying them off, and ſo are frequently the cauſe of Piles and all the miſchief that attends them. Therefore we take off the <hi>Plethora,</hi> and make revulſion by Bleeding in the Arm, before we apply them.</p>
                     <p>The externall Medicaments proper in the Cure of this Diſeaſe are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds, and ought to be proportioned according as they are internall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, recent or of long continuance, or according to the pain and cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ariſe.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall begin with the externall ones, which, whether they be one or more, do alway thruſt forth with great pain, and are ſubject to Inflammation. In which caſe, if you propoſe to reſtrain the Flux, and dry them up, ℞ <hi>fol. plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag. polygon. ſummit. rubi, equiſeti, an.</hi> M. ſs. <hi>flor. verbaſci,</hi> M. ij. <hi>ſem. lini,</hi> ℥ij. <hi>flor. roſ. rub. cort. granat. balauſt. baccar. myrtill. an.</hi>

                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be in its ſtate, and the pain exceeding great, ℞ <hi>fol. malv. verbaſci, an.</hi> M.j. <hi>flor. hyperic.</hi> M. ſs. <hi>rad. cynogloſ.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſem. lini, foenug. an.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the Cure of the internall Piles the ſame emollient Decoctions and Anodynes which have been propoſed in the externall ones may be injected with a Syringe to good purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If the pain proceed from a groſs viſcid Matter diſtending them, ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments ought to be applied as are moderately heating, and reſolving: <hi>viz. radic. chelidonima, rad. gladioli, caepae, allium, ſquillae,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo <hi>Balſam. ſulph. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landii.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Declination of this Diſeaſe you may treate them with Medicaments that are powerfully drying: for the Parts diſtempered are lax, and, having been much diſtended with that Humour, cannot eaſily recover their former tone. Therefore we uſe <hi>bolus Armen. calx lota, crocus Martis aſtring. ſquam. ferri, aerugo,</hi> &amp;c. alone, or mixed with <hi>mel commune, axung. porciin.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>aqua calcis, aluminoſa, ſulphurat. lap. medicamentoſ.</hi> &amp;c. When they do not yield to ſuch applications but are pendent as <hi>uvae,</hi> &amp;c. they will be apt to ſwell upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little diſturbance, therefore in ſuch caſes I frequently cut them off.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Apertae</hi> or bleeding <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> ought not to be ſtopped while they diſcharge a groſs vitious Bloud,<note place="margin">Cure of the <hi>Haemorrhoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des apertae,</hi> or bleeding Piles.</note> or while the Patient beareth the evacuation well, and laboureth of ſome Diſeaſe, whereof he may hope to be freed by the bleeding of them. In theſe caſes the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> ought to be permitted to flow freely forth. If they do not, you are to endeavour to make them bleed with ſuch Medicaments as have a quality thereto. The internalls are all thoſe which have Aloes, Scammony, <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> &amp;c. Doctor <hi>Read</hi> in his Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Lectures commends <hi>pil. Ruffi;</hi> and a Phyſician in the Country once told me, he had experimented them with good ſucceſs, and freed himſelf of a <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoe</hi> and <hi>Phthiſis</hi> he was falling into.</p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:95669:117"/>
                     <p>The Ancients have offered unto us divers Medicaments to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <hi>viz.</hi> the rubbing of the <hi>Podex</hi> with Fig-leaves; alſo the Roots of wild Cucumber, Sow-bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made in the form of a Suppoſitory, and put up.

It would be of great uſe in the preventing as well as curing of many Diſeaſes, if ſuch evacuations could be made when we would: but ſo far as I could yet ever ſee, outward Medicaments have rather diſturb'd the Parts, then moved them to bleed to any purpoſe: yet I ſuppoſe they may provoke them in ſuch Bodies as have been heretofore ſubject to them, and ſo may be of good uſe.</p>
                     <p>In others who are extraordinarily ſubject to the bleeding of the <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids,</hi> your care will be required in the moderating of them by regulation of Diet and manner of living: in which caſes I refer you to the Chapter of the <hi>Wounds of Veins and Arteries.</hi> If the Flux of bloud be great, you may make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion by Venaeſection, Cupping, and binding the remote Parts, alſo by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of aſtringent Medicaments; or by ſuch internalls as may incraſſate and contemperate the Ferment in the Bloud.

                        </note> of a lean and dry Habit of body, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> called <hi>caecae</hi> affecting the verge of the <hi>Anus.</hi> I let him bloud about ſeven ounces in the Arm, and, in conſideration of his coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, adviſed a Clyſter of Milk and Sugar. The ſame night I fomented the Piles with the Decoction of <hi>plantag. polygon.</hi> &amp;c. and applied a Pledgit of Tow ſpred with <hi>unguent. populeon,</hi> as is preſcribed in the method of Cure: by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof he was eaſed, and in few days cured.</p>
                     <p>Another aged fifty years of a full Body,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat.</note> diſeaſed with the ſame kind of Piles, with great pain. They lay varicous in a great cluſter, ſo as it was not eaſy to find the way into the <hi>Anus:</hi> but in preſſing ſome of them on one ſide, I ſaw a looſe red Fleſh thruſting from within outwards. It was the inner Spongie Coat of the <hi>Recium inteſtinum</hi> relaxed by the Fluxion, and hence a ſerous Humour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſome <hi>Mucus.</hi> I let him bloud in the Arm about twelve ounces at that inſtant, and ſtuped the inflamed Piles with cloaths wrung out of Claret-wine. An hour or two after a Clyſter was exhibited of Milk with the Yolk of an Egge, ſome Sugar, and two ounces of <hi>ol. hyperic.</hi> which brought away hard Excrements, and mitigated the bearing down which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained ſo much of. The ſame night I viſited him again, and fomented with a Decoction of <hi>malv. verbaſ. ſem. lini,</hi> &amp;c. as it is deſcribed, and applied a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95669:117"/>Cataplaſm of the <hi>faeces</hi> beaten and pulped. I adviſed him to a ſlender Diet, and preſcribed him a Barley-cream <hi>cum ſem. melon. papaver. alb.</hi> a few Almonds, a little juice of Lemons, <hi>aq. roſ. &amp; cinnam. hordeat.</hi> He reſted tollerably well that night, and was eaſier in the morning. I continued the ſame method of dreſſing till the pain was aſſwaged, repeating Clyſters as occaſion offer'd; and afterwards fomented them with a Decoction of <hi>ſummit. anethi, hyperici, ſalviae, roſ. rub. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> in Wine, by which I diſcuſſed and dried up the humidity, and thereby cured him.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about forty ſix years of age, abounding with ſharp Humours,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of externall <hi>Haemorrhoids.</hi>
                        </note> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſeaſed with the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> being one time ſorely afflicted with them, conſulted me. I ſaw them lying in a great Cluſter round the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> which was alſo relaxed and turned out. The <hi>Varices</hi> were of different ſizes and colours: ſome were inflamed red, others pale, others livid, and ſome black. At firſt ſight I ſuppoſed them Gangrened: but after a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch I obſerved the different colour of them proceeded from the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Humours which dilated them, and cauſed the Compreſſion they made upon one another. We commonly ſee the ſame in making a Ligature on any of the <hi>Varices;</hi> in which caſe generally they inflame, or if tyed very ſtraight, grow pale and become livid; then, as the heat extinguiſheth they grow black: Yet ſometime, upon tying, the Bloud burſts forth, and they recover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat. Thus in our caſe, through want of timely relief, they inflamed and ſwelled, and ſtraightned themſelves; till by corrupting they wither'd, and made room for their fellows. Whether theſe would have gangren'd if not then ſuccoured, I ſhall not conclude; but in bodies ill-habited they do ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.

The next morning I fomented the diſeaſed Parts with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid diſcutient and drying Decoction, and applied that old Remedy of fryed Leeks with Butter, beaten to a Cataplaſm: by which the pain was mitigated and the varicous Swellings relaxed. The Ulcerations were afterwards dried up by the ſprinkling them with <hi>pulv. nuc. cupreſſ. &amp; balauſt.</hi> and the continued uſe of the foreſaid diſcutient Fomentation; in which, towards the declination of the Diſeaſe, was diſſolved <hi>extract. ſumach,</hi> whereby the humidity was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and the <hi>Anus</hi> reduced; during which his Body was kept ſoluble by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Lenient <hi>Bolus's</hi> of <hi>caſſiae extract.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

I injected two or three ſpoonfull of <hi>ſucc. urticar.</hi> and applied a Pledgit of Tow on the <hi>Podex</hi> dipt in a Solution of <hi>extract. ſumach</hi> in red Wine; then preſcribed him an Emulſion, <hi>ex ſem. hyoſcyam. &amp; papaver. alb.</hi> By this method the Bleeding was ſtopt, but thereupon he grew feveriſh, and the <hi>Haemorrhoids</hi> ſwelled externally.

I let her bloud in the Arm four ounces, and by the application of Diſcutients externally to the <hi>Fauces,</hi> and a Gargariſm of a few diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with <hi>ſal prunellae &amp; ſyr. diamoron,</hi> the Inflammation remitted, and ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

I viewed the diſeaſed Part, and ſaw the <hi>Podex</hi> relaxed ſo much as I believe I might have put up my four fingers. It was varicous round the verge, and had bled ſome two or three ounces. From the internall Piles he frequently bled very much, yet was not the leſs pained. I called for ſoft Napkins well warmed, and applied one after another hot, whereby I ſoon quieted and reduced the relaxed <hi>Anus.</hi> I commended to his uſe an Infuſion of Aſtringents in red Wine, to be applied hot with Scarlet-cloaths immediately upon his coming from the Cloſe-ſtool, and to wear a Pledgit of Tow ſprinkled with <hi>pulv. nuc. cupreſſ. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. by the uſe of which he was frequently much eaſed.

It is a Relaxation of the Sphincter to ſuch a degree,<note place="margin">Deſcription.</note> that the internall rugous Coat of the Inteſtine turneth out, and bearet down, making a Swelling proportionably.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Diſeaſe are Coſtiveneſs, at which time,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> ſtraining to eaſe nature it frequently falls down; alſo Fluxes of the Bowells in <hi>Diarrhaea, Dyſenteria,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Teneſmus.</hi> The Piles are for the moſt part a Cauſe, ſo is hard Labour in Child-bed, and the Stone in the Bladder. In Infants it commonly falleth down through Crudity or over-moiſture of the <hi>Levatores Ani.</hi> In thoſe of Age the Cauſe will be more certainly diſcovered by the complaint of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are evident to the ſight: the inſide is turned outward,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and the Tumour is of a fleſhy colour and rugous, by reaſon of the folds and wrinkles of the Coat; and it is accompanied with an uneaſineſs, and deſire to goe to Stool.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is difficult,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but much worſe in old people then young; and if it ſucceeded a <hi>Dyſenterie</hi> or <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> it is the moſt difficult. In the latter caſe it is ſcarce ever curable. If it happened through Coſtiveneſs, the Cure is hopefull; ſo it is if it was cauſed from the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Child-bed Labour, if in that work the Muſcles or Membranes were not torn.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> the prolapſed Inteſtine ought to be put up with an eaſy hand. The uſuall method is, to apply a Stupe of Flannell or Scarlet-cloath, wrung out of ſome Decoction of red Wine hot; and after the Part hath been a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95669:119"/>while fomented, you are to thruſt up the relaxed <hi>Anus</hi> with your fingers till you have reduced it. If the Tumour be great and hard, you ought then to foment it with Emollients and Diſcutients, <hi>viz. fol. mal. viol. tapſ. barbat. flor. ſambuci, cham. meliloti, ſem. lini, foenugraeci,</hi> &amp;c.

Therefore it is that we deſire the Patient ſhould be ſo well diſpoſed in his Bowells, that, if it be poſſible, he may goe ſeldome to Stool, and when he doth, that it may be with the leaſt ſtraining. He ſhould alſo have a couple of Sticks whittled and fitted for him to place cloſe on each ſide the <hi>Podex,</hi> ſo as in ſtraining the Excrements may paſs out, yet the Prolapſe of the Inteſtine be hindred. For the like purpoſe I have frequently commended a ſmall Tin-hoop to be faſtned in a quilted Boulſter, which being fitted with Bandage may be retained at that time to paſs the Excrements through, and prevent the Relapſe. What you can invent to this purpoſe will much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Cure.</p>
                     <p>An Infant about a month old was diſeaſed with a <hi>Procidentia Ani,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Prociden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Ani.</hi>
                        </note> which being not reduceable by the Women, I fomented it with red Wine three or four times, then with my fingers upon the Stupe preſſed equally upon it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it. I continued the fomenting it a while longer, then applied a Pledgit of dry Tow upon the <hi>Anus,</hi> directing them how to relieve it in caſe of its Relapſe. I afterwards ſent them papers of Aſtringents to infuſe in red Wine, to apply as above ſaid. By which method it was ſtrengthened and cured in few days by the care of the Nurſe.</p>
                     <p>A ſickly Child about four years old had been ſome months diſeaſed with a <hi>Procidentia Ani,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Prociden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Ani.</hi>
                        </note> by reaſon of a preceding Flux of the Bowells with <hi>Teneſmus.</hi> It had been neglected by the Servant that attended it, and was too much ſwelled to yield to a Reduction. I fomented it with the diſcutient and emollient Decoction preſcribed in the method of Cure, then bound on warme Stupes wrung out of the ſame, and kept him in bed. The Swelling being thereby ſomewhat relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I endeavoured again Reduction; but it not yielding thereto, I fomented it with Diſcutients with ſomewhat of Aſtringency, and ſprinkled the inner Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle with <hi>pulv. nuc. cupreſſ. corn. cervi uſti, an. part. aequal.</hi> then applied warm Stupes thereon. After I had thus dryed up the ſuperfluous Humidity, I attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted it again: but as I preſſed upon it on one ſide, it roſe on the other. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the warm Stupes, and with my fingers upon the Stupe I preſſed cloſe upon it, and twiddled it in firſt one ſide, then the other. It being reduced, a Compreſs of Tow made in the form of a great Button, dipt in an aſtringent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, was placed thereon, and retained by good Bandage. His Diet was boiled Rice and ſuch-like, which might prevent a Looſeneſs. At his next go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Stool I was fetched. After he had eaſed nature, I fomented the relaxed <hi>Anus,</hi> and having cleanſed and dried it, reduced it eaſily, then dreſſed it as before, and continued my attendance at ſuch times; whereby I facilitated the work and cured the Child, by the aſſiſtance of the Servant that attended it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch-like in Children to twelve years of age I have happily recovered by the like method.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about twenty eight years of age,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Prociden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Ani.</hi>
                        </note> afflicted with a <hi>Procidentia Ani,</hi> conſulted me. It was neither inflamed nor hard; but, having been long out, was not eaſy to reduce. I returned that evening with a Decoction of <hi>ſummitat.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95669:119"/>anethi, hyperici, flor. cham. roſ. rub. balauſt. ſumach, nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> made in Wine; and after I had fomented the relaxed Parts, I endeavoured again to reduce it: but it not yielding, I ſprinkled the inner Coat of the relaxed <hi>Anus</hi> with <hi>pulv. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> and applied a warm Stupe over it with retentive Bandage. The next morning I returned thither, and repeated the Fomentation, and having thereby reduced it, I dreſſed it up with a Compreſs of Tow made in the form of a Button dipt in a Solution of <hi>extract. ſumach</hi> in red Wine, with Bandage to retain it cloſe. I afterwards made him ſeverall viſits, and aſſiſted him in the reducing it, directing him according to the way propoſed in the method of Cure for preventing the Relapſe: by which method the Relapſe was leſſened, and the eaſier reduced when it ſlipt out.</p>
                     <p>I was fetched to a Woman of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of <hi>Prociden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Ani.</hi>
                        </note> who had been long afflicted with the <hi>Haemorhoids</hi> both internall and externall, through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of which the Sphincter relaxed, and, for want of timely reduction, in proceſs of time ſwelled big, and was accompanied with great Fluxion, Ulceration, and various ſorts of Excreſcences, which rendred it uncapable of being reduced. I adviſed a diſcutient and aſtringent <hi>Fotus,</hi> as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the method of Cure; and the next day cut off the Excreſcences with a pair of Sciſſors, and applied warm Stupes, to continue the bleeding till I thought I had ſufficiently given a breathing to the Part. Then ſprinkling them with a mixture of <hi>pulv. cort. granat. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> with a third part of <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> I applied a warm Stupe over all, with retentive Bandage.

                        </note> having laboured a long time under various Chronick Diſeaſes, and of late years a ſuppoſed <hi>Fiſtula in Ano,</hi> which grew daily more vexatious; I was conſulted. Upon view of the Part, I judged it a <hi>Procidentia Ani.</hi> It being queſtioned, I called for warme Napkins, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them hot one after another, I reduced it whilſt I preſſed one of the warme Cloaths cloſe to it, and thereby eaſed the Patient, and confirmed the Judgement I had delivered of it. This <hi>Procidentia Ani,</hi> by reaſon of its long continuance, and the continuall diſcharge of ſerous Humours by it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Part ſo lax, that it relapſed upon the leaſt walking. Wherefore I provided accordingly a Compreſs dipt in aſtringent Liquours, with Bandage to retain it cloſe, and ſome days attended him in reducing it, and in ſhewing his Servants how to reduce and dreſs it. The work of Reduction being grown more eaſy to his Servants, the Patient contented himſelf with having it reduced ſo often as occaſion offered, and declined the trouble (as he called it) of Bandage. During the time of my attendance on this Patient, I obſerved the folded Sheet which lay all night under him to be wet through, as if ſo much water had ſieped into it. Upon enquiry whence it proceeded, and feeling his Belly, I concluded the Patient hydropicall, and that the diſcharge <hi>per Anum</hi> was from thence. I was
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95669:120"/>not much credited; but it appeared ſo about three quarters of a year after, when he dying of an Apoplexy, his Servants taking him out of Bed, the Sheet under him was found wet as aforeſaid. In order to the Embalming of him, I pierced his Belly, and diſcharged twenty two pints and a half of Water. Towards the latter part of his life he was ſubject to Vomiting, with dejection of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: the <hi>Procidentia Ani</hi> was alſo continually attended with a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> which was no ſmall diſturbance to his Bowells.

He was a man of about fifty ſix years of age of a healthy Conſtitution; he complained that he had been long obſtructed in eaſing of nature by reaſon (as he thought) of the Piles, which of late was much more grievous to him, they in a manner ſtopping up the <hi>Anus.</hi> I viewed the Part, and ſaw a numerous company of Excreſcences, great and ſmall, overſpreading the <hi>Anus,</hi> inſomuch that it was very difficult to finde their inſertion. There were five very large, of the form of green Figs, the leaſt of them about an inch and a half long, inſerted within the <hi>Anus.</hi> There were other leſſer growing more externally, upon the verge of them ſome hung like ſo many Leeches. There were alſo about the <hi>Anus</hi> many <hi>Thymi</hi> growing right up of different ſize; under which were <hi>Rhagades,</hi> Chaps and Fiſſures, with ſmall Excreſcences or <hi>Papulae</hi> thruſting here and there out of them. Theſe being all waſhed and cleanſed from the Excrements, retained the naturall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Skin, and were not painfull. He had concealed his Diſeaſe ſo long as
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95669:121"/>he could, and was encouraged to ſend for me, upon a report he had heard from a Neighbour of his, whom I had freed from an Excreſcence in the ſame Part. I readily undertook the Extirpation of them, but deſired to have ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work: to which purpoſe one was conſulted; but he, diſcouraging us with a prediction of their malign quality, left us. Yet the Patient urging me to proceed in the operation, and I conſidering the neceſſity of it: I came the next day with my Servant, furniſhed with Knife, Sciſſors, Needles and ſtrong Thread, actuall and potentiall Cauteries, aſtringent Powders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed the Patient in a clear light, with his Knees drawn up towards his Body, he with my Servant aſſiſting with their hands, I again conſidered the Part affected; and finding it difficult to get to the roots of thoſe inſerted within the <hi>Anus,</hi> thought to begin with thoſe more remote. But ſuſpecting how his courage might hold out, I began with thoſe neareſt the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> clipping them off cloſe from their roots one after another, as faſt as I could, not minding their bleeding, till I had freed my way to thoſe within the <hi>Anus.</hi> Then with a Spunge dipt in <hi>Oxycrate</hi> I waſhed off the Bloud, and with ſmall actuall Cauteries dried the roots of them. That done I oyled my Finger, and paſſed it into the <hi>Anus,</hi> to make way to the next: and whilſt I held my Finger beyond it cloſe to the root, my Servant the mean time pulling the <hi>Ficus</hi> to him, I paſſed the Sciſſors under it towards the end of my Finger; then tyed them, and paſſing on cut them off, my Finger within directing me in the work. I tried the <hi>Speculum Ani:</hi> and by the help of my Finger within, and a <hi>Speculum</hi> at the entrance upon the verge, I cleared the <hi>Anus</hi> of them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized their roots, and put up a bit of a Rag dipt in <hi>unguent. refrig.

Some of thoſe that had very ſmall roots I burnt with the Button-end of my Probe, others with the point of my <hi>Forceps.</hi> The Lips of ſome of the <hi>Rhagades</hi> which were callous I burnt with the <hi>Spatula,</hi> ſome others I rubbed off with the Cauſtick-ſtone. Thus in leſs then an hour and a half I conſumed them all, and left the <hi>Anus</hi> free, and the Parts about ſmooth. I dreſſed them up with a Pledgit of Two ſpred with <hi>unguent. refrig.

                     <p>IN the lower part of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> where the <hi>Muſculi Ani</hi> are inſerted, there frequently ariſeth a hot Tumour called <hi>Phyma.</hi> You may find it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed amongſt the Tumours ariſing from Bloud; therefore I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you here with a farther Deſcription of it; but give you three inſtances of it as it affected the <hi>Anus,</hi> the better to ſhew you the originall of <hi>Fiſtulae in Ano:</hi> they for the moſt part proceeding from theſe Abſceſſes, whether they break with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and ulcerate there, or the matter deſcend lower, and raiſe a Tumour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the verge of the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe within the <hi>Anus</hi> produce the moſt dangerous <hi>Fiſtulae.</hi> The matter of which penetrating through the coats into the neighbouring Muſcles,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> is rarely diſcovered till it hath made its way more outward amongſt the Muſcles of the buttock; but if it chance to be diſcovered ſooner, yet the cure is moſt difficult: nay thoſe <hi>Phymata</hi> which appear outwardly upon the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> though they are of eaſier cure; yet if they be ill handled, the defluxion is continued, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> within groweth callous, and requireth the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that <hi>Fiſtulae in Ano</hi> do, it being directly ſuch as you may ſee in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The way to prevent theſe miſchiefs, is by timely laying open the externall <hi>Phyma</hi> by Cauſtick, that the Matter may have free diſcharge;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> for if you open that by inciſion it muſt be kept ſo with a Tent, which cannot be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in: and whether the Matter be choked in by that, or it ſlide out and the Orifice cloſe up, is alike inconvenient and prolongs the cure.

The next morning I heard the Patient had reſted tollerably well. I took off the Dreſſings, and found the Matter diſcharged through the Eſcar, which was, as I had deſigned it, the breadth of a two-pence.

I viewed the Part and made a ſearch with my finger dipt in a little oyl, but diſcovered nothing whereby I might ſuſpect Ulcer or Piles. I injected a ſpoonfull or two of <hi>ol. liliorum</hi> warm, and directed him the uſe of it; but after three or four days the Pain increaſing, I made a ſearch, and felt a Swelling on that Part which lieth next to the neck of the Bladder; I took a crooked inciſion-Knife, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the edge of it almoſt to the point, with a bit of Plaiſter conveyed it in by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95669:122"/>my Finger to the Swelling, and made inciſion into the Tumour; he preſently diſcharged a ſpoonfull or two of Matter. From that time he complained no more of pain.

They are rather diſcovered by the diſcharge of a thin Humour ſtai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing the Shirt, then by any pain they have; which diſcharge is often thought to be rather a Sweating of the Part then otherwiſe: but in progreſs it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with itching, and is ſubject to excoriation; from whence it is that various ſorts of <hi>Papulae,</hi> &amp;c. do ariſe, and ſometimes <hi>Rhagades.</hi> At laſt theſe ſorts of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Ulcers ſpread outward or grow callous, and the Orifice groweth hard and ſo contracted that you cannot paſs in the ſmalleſt Probe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Ulcers which proceed from <hi>Phyma,</hi> do paſs their Matter deep amongſt the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the Muſcles, as other Abſceſſes in fleſhy parts do according as they can make their way. Theſe ſometime penetrate through the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> to the very neck of the Bladder; yea into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> or at beſt do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate their Matter in amongſt the <hi>Muſculi Glutei,</hi> &amp;c. This happeneth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Apoſtemation at firſt lay deep or ſhallow, or was great or ſmall, or in a body Plethorique or ill-habited. They are very painfull, and diſcharge a purulent Matter proportionably as they are hollow, and are they which do <hi>cuniculos agere;</hi> yet they do grow callous, and are reckoned amongſt the worſt ſorts of <hi>Fiſtulae Ani.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> I have already declared with the manner of their growth, by which I ſuppoſe they may be ſufficiently diſcovered. If you make a ſearch
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95669:122"/>with a Probe into the ſinuous Ulcer ariſing from the Piles, and the while paſs your Finger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> you ſhall feel the Probe run all along between the Tunicles of the Inteſtine, and it may be paſs out through the Pile which gave it its originall: whereas, the other ſinuous Ulcers have in their beginning no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Orifice, but diſcharge their Matter by Stool; but at length poſſibly they paſs their Matter externally through one or more Orifices, more or leſs diſtant from the <hi>Podex,</hi> or according as the Abſceſs lay in the Inteſtine.</p>
                     <p>Sinuous Ulcers ariſing from the Piles are heathfull,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and ought not to be cured while they may be continued without pain or diſturbance to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Sinuous Ulcers ariſing from <hi>Phymata</hi> are dangerous and difficult of cure, if they have been of long continuance. The Ulcer in <hi>Ano</hi> is alſo of difficult cure, if it diſcharge great quantity of Matter by an opening ſo remote that you cannot lay it open with ſafety; but if the <hi>Sinus</hi> lye neer the <hi>Anus,</hi> the cure will be more eaſy.</p>
                     <p>Sinuous Ulcers in progreſs of time grow callous, and are then deſervedly called <hi>Fiſtulae.</hi> What a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is I have declared in its proper Chapter: How theſe Sinuous Ulcers become fiſtulous, I have ſhewed you in this foregoing Diſcourſe with the Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may alſo make a Prognoſtick of them from what hath been ſaid of ſinuous Ulcers, they differing onely from them as they are callous; for if <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> do run ſuperficially upwards by the <hi>Rectum inteſtinum,</hi> whether it penetrate the <hi>Anus</hi> or not, the cure is without dnager or difficulty performed. Thoſe <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> which run higher up then you can reach with your Finger are difficult to cure, becauſe you cannot lay them open the whole length, for the Humour will flow from the remaining <hi>Sinus</hi> upon the part opened, and hinders its cicatrizing.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> which penetrate deep beyond the <hi>Muſculi Ani,</hi> if they be cured by laying open, the Patient will afterwards retain his Excrements with much difficulty; and if they reach quite beyond the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> the retention is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be the effect of a <hi>Cacochymical</hi> Habit of body, eſpecially if the Lungs be weak, or any other of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> it will be reaſonable to keep it open as a Fontanell for diſcharge of that peccant Matter; but if it cannot be kept open with eaſe to the Patient, it will be requiſite that a good Diet be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and the Humours carried off ſome other way before you cure the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> and Iſſues elſewhere opened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> therefore in <hi>Ano</hi> are not alway curable, nor ſafe to be cured; they frequently ſerving nature for the diſcharge of ſuperfluous Humours,<note place="margin">Cure. palliative.</note> brought down by the Haemorrhodiall veſſells: ſo that unleſs they be painfull and vexatious in keeping open, you ought not to cure them, eſpecially if they be ſmall and terminate in the circumference of the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which caſe if you apprehend that the Orifices of them will ſwell and not keep open, or that by reaſon of the contraction of the <hi>Callus</hi> the Matter may be ſtreightned, and inſinuate itſelf lower or deeper, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the evacuation troubleſome; you may then apply a ſmall Cauſtick upon the Orifice to remove the <hi>Callus,</hi> after which ſeparation of the Slough, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may be kept open with more eaſe as a fontanell; and for the receiving the Matter, and preventing of excoriation, the Patient may wear a Pledgit of fine Tow which will ſit cloſe without Bandage; or it may be ſpread thin with any lenient <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent,</hi> as the exigency requires, and be kept clean without pain or conſiderable trouble, till time ſhall cure it, or indicate what to do more in it.</p>
                     <p>But if you deſign the Cure, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> lye more diſtant from the <hi>Anus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Curative.</note>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:95669:123"/>you ſhall begin with laying it open firſt to the <hi>Anus,</hi> and curing that Apertion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you divide that in <hi>Ano.</hi> Which being done you ſhall then conſider the Habit of body, and according as the Humours are peccant in quantity or quality, ſo you may let Bloud or purge: but if there be no neceſſity of either, you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe your Patient a good Diet to prevent Fluxion, and eſpecially a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> for a looſeneſs much diſturbes the Cure; therefore in ſuch caſes you are to forbear the dividing the <hi>Sinus</hi> till that be ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>The way of laying open the <hi>Fiſtula in Ano</hi> is either by Inciſion or Ligature; the latter was the way of the Antients, and ought to be proportioned ſo as it may divide the <hi>Sinus</hi> with the leaſt pain: it is made of twiſted brown Thread, or ſtitching Silk, ſome put a Horſe-hair to them, whereby they are made to do their work the quicker; a twiſt of three Threads or of ſtitching Silk may be ſufficient, for if you make the Ligature big, it will too much bruiſe the Fleſh in cutting it. In the next place you are to conſider the Needle you paſs the Ligature with. If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> hath penetrated the Inteſtine, then a Leaden Probe with an Eye, or of any thing elſe that is pliant, will ſerve to carry the Ligature through; it ought to be pliant, that it may perform its work with more eaſe: a piece of a ſearching-Candle may ſerve in ſome, in others a Probe of ſmall Wire of Silver or Gold; for a preſent ſupply I have made uſe of a ſmall Probe out of my Plaiſter-box, cutting off part of it, and ſmoothing the end. Where the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> hath not penetrated, I have for need made uſe of the like Probe making the point ſharp to paſs through the Inteſtine; but you ought to have Needles more pliant, fit for that work. In ſome caſes where the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> lyes high, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> crooked, I make uſe of a fit <hi>Cannula</hi> for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Needle up, and to ſtrengthen it in its work, that it do not bend in the perforating the Inteſtine.</p>
                     <p>The way by Inciſion is with a pair of Sciſſors to divide the <hi>Sinus,</hi> a way approved by ſome who have obſerved the ſpeedy diviſion it makes; and in truth, if the <hi>Sinus</hi> be ſhort it is the beſt. In doing thereof they ought to be carefull the while, leſt the folds of the rugous Coat fall between, for ſo you make two Wounds for one. But if the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> penetrate the Inteſtine deep, the work will be more hazardous, not onely in the cutting as I ſaid before, but in progreſs of the Cure; for the recent divided Lips will be apt to fall upon one another again, and then what can hinder their uniting? which if they do the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is renewed, a Doffill or Tent put up the <hi>Sinus</hi> will not continue in it, but lye as a Suppoſitory ſtimulating the Inteſtine to excrete it: whereas the Ligature contuſes the Lips in cutting them, ſo that they require to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted before they can unite, in which time the <hi>Sinus</hi> fills up and heals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; inſomuch as the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> may be judged to cure above, as the Ligature divides it below. I ſhall anon give you ſome inſtances of both ways, and leave it to your own Judgements to proceed as you like beſt. The manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ligature is this.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall make a ſearch with a Probe into the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> running up by the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and the while anoint your Finger with a little Oyl or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and paſs it up; and according as you feel the Probe more or leſs diſtant, or penetrating, proceed in the Cure. If the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be ſtreight and much callous, dilate it firſt with a <hi>Gentian-root</hi> or the like, and remove the <hi>Callus</hi> by ſuch <hi>cathareticks</hi> as have been propoſed in the Chapter of <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in generall. But if that ſide be onely callous which is next the Inteſtine, you may divide that in laying open the <hi>Fiſtula;</hi> therefore paſs your Ligature with a Needle blunt or ſharp, according as the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> penetrated or not; and as you paſs the Needle up with one hand, turne the point with your Finger which is in <hi>Ano,</hi> and bring it out under that Finger as you thruſt it up with the other: and if you paſs
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95669:123"/>the Needle through a <hi>Cannula,</hi> you muſt firſt paſs up the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and place the end of it againſt your Finger, which is in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> then another holding the <hi>Cannula,</hi> paſs your Needle through it into the Gut; and as it is brought out by your Finger there ſlip off the <hi>Cannula,</hi> and haſten the Needle forward on its way, till you have brought it out with the Ligature: then cut off the Needle, and make a knot upon a fold of Linnen or bit of Plaiſter, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the Ligatures cutting the outſide, tie it as ſtreight as the Patient can bear, and let the ſecond knot be with a bow: then place the ends of the Ligature on one ſide, leſt it be fouled in going to Stool, and apply a Stupe of Tow dipt in <hi>vino auſtero, &amp; ol. roſ.</hi> to calm the heat of the part. Some make the knot upon a bit of Stick and twiſt it daily; but that is more painfull, and cuts from without inward, which is to be avoided. I uſe to drſs them daily after eaſement of Nature, and if there be cauſe, inject <hi>Decoct. hordei cum ſem. cydon.</hi> and apply ſome Lenient as aboveſaid, or <hi>unguent. roſat. popul.</hi> &amp;c. and the fourth day looſen the Ligature by drawing the bow-knot, and tye it ſtreighter: ſo in twice or thrice tying the Ligature will cut its way out, or when it is almoſt through with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors you may free the reſidue; or if the <hi>Sinus</hi> run deep under the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> that the Lips be like to lye high, ſo as to make a guttur, it will be better to take them down by the application of a Cauſtick, for it will much haſten the Cure, and make the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> ſmooth.</p>
                     <p>If there be any ſhriveld Piles, <hi>Condylomata,</hi> &amp;c. about the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> cut them off at the ſame time or before you make the Ligature, to prevent the inflation they would be ſubject to from the pain cauſed by the Ligature or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. The <hi>Sinus</hi> laid open, whether it were by Inciſion or Ligature, the Ulcer requires to be digeſted, incarned and cicatrized, as hath been ſhewed in other Ulcers, and ſhall be more particularly demonſtrated in the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A Young married Wife being diſeaſed in <hi>Ano,</hi>

At length I was conſulted, and diſcovering nothing outward about the <hi>Anus,</hi> I paſſed my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger up into the <hi>Rectum inteſtinum;</hi> about an inch within on the left ſide I felt a Perforation, I pulled back my Finger and ſaw it Mattery; I concluded that was the Orifice of the Ulcer, and ſuppoſed its <hi>Sinus</hi> lay amongſt the Muſcles, and that it took its Originall from a <hi>Phyma,</hi> which ſhe concealing, as in that modeſt Sex it frequently happens, the Matter had corroded and penetrated the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and the adjacent fleſhy parts: I preſſed with my Fingers on the outſide where I conjected the Abſceſs to ly, and thought I felt the <hi>Sinus;</hi> I marked the place, and purpoſed the opening it when it ſhould be deſired. At that time my buſineſs was to ſatisfie the Relations concerning her Diſeaſe, which I declared to be an Ulcer in <hi>Ano,</hi> and for further proof offered to open it in that place I had marked; which they conſenting to, I came about ten days after, and applied a Cauſtick upon that very place in the preſence of ſome of her Kniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and the next day divided the Eſcar, and paſſing the Knife down into it I met with the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and drawing my Inciſion towards the <hi>Anus,</hi> under the <hi>coccix</hi> gave vent to the Matter; then paſſed a Ligature with a blunt-pointed Needle, through the <hi>Sinus</hi> into the Gut, and with my Finger in <hi>Ano</hi> bowed the end of the Probe, and as I thruſt it in with one hand, brought it out with my Finger of the other; then cut off the Needle, and tied the Ligature on a faſt knot, and dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> dipt in a little <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> warm
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95669:124"/>to haſten the ſeparation of the Eſcar. They continued this way of dreſſing it daily, till the Eſcar ſeparated, then I tied the Ligature ſtreighter, and in few days cut it through, and digeſted the Ulcer with the common digeſtive; and deterged, incarned with <hi>mundif.

The <hi>Sinus</hi> did ſtretch it ſelf down from the verge of the <hi>Anus</hi> neer the <hi>coccix,</hi> towards the <hi>perineum,</hi> about two inches, diſcharging much Matter. I laid open the <hi>Sinus</hi> with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors to the <hi>Anus,</hi> and dreſſed it up with the Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> ſpread upon Doſſills dipt in <hi>pulv.

This being reſolved upon, I adviſed the Patient to apply upon it a Pledgit of fine ſoft Tow morning and evening, or ſo often as occaſion required; it kept on without Bandage, and received the Matter which diſcharged, and ſerved as a Fontanell without any diſturbance to him in riding or ſitting. Thus it was continued ſome years with great eaſe and advantage to his health; but ſince that Phyſicians death, the Patient was perſwaded by others to have it cured. I was ſent for and made a ſearch, and found it had perforated the <hi>Anus</hi> about half an inch within the <hi>Rectum:</hi> I paſſed a Ligature with a piece of a Wax ſearching-Candle, and tyed the Ligature ſtreight upon a fold of Plaiſter to prevent the cutting outwardly; then cut off the overplus of the Ligature, applied a Pledgit ſpread with <hi>unguent. alb. camph.</hi> over all. The Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the dreſſings ſo often as he went to Stool, and the fourth day I looſened the Bow-knot; and finding the Ligature neer paſſed through, divided it with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and dreſſed it up with the common Digeſtive: after it was digeſted I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. diapomp.</hi> upon a Pledgit of Tow, and cleanſed the Ulcer daily with <hi>aq. lap. med.

                     <p>A Perſon aged about thirty years,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer.</note> of a ſickly Conſtitution, ſubject to Cough and Rheums, being one day coſtive, and ſtraining to eaſe nature, felt ſomewhat ſlip down as it were between the Tunicles of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> to the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> which lay uneaſy; he put up his Finger and felt a ſmall Tubercle of the bigneſs of a large Pea, which increaſing ſettled ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lower, and made a hard Swelling without the verge of the <hi>Anus</hi> on the right ſide, and in few days raiſed itſelf into a Tumour as big as a Pidgeons-Egg, and inflamed and ſuppurated. I was then conſulted, and opened it by Cauſtick, and diſcharged about two or three ſpoonfulls of a digeſted white Matter: after ſeparation of the Eſcar, I finding much Matter diſcharged out of it, I made a ſearch, and found it run up cloſe along the <hi>Rectum;</hi> I laid it open to the <hi>Anus</hi> by a ſnip with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and dreſt it with a Doſſill ſpread with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and a Pledgit of ſoft fine Tow ſpread with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. album</hi> over it, and in few days cured it to the verge of the <hi>Anus.</hi> Then conſidering the Patient labouring under a Cough with other obſtructions, I propoſed to him the continuing this Ulcer open as a Fontanell, till he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over

I adviſed onely a Pledgit of Tow to be applied to it, with directions to renew it as he ſhould ſee cauſe. I took leave of him, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my directions, and finding no inconveniency in riding, walking, or the like, continued it as a Fontanell to his much advantage; he recovering his health very well afterwards, and is yet alive.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about forty years old came out of the Country,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in <hi>Ano.</hi>
                        </note> labouring of a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano,</hi> breaking out on the left ſide: it aroſe from a <hi>Phyma,</hi> (I ſuppoſe;) the <hi>Sinus</hi> was large and painfull, the Matter having ſpread under it. If I had laid this open by inciſion, the Lips would have lien hollow, and have rendred the Ulcer ſlow in curing; therefore I removed them by Cauſtick, laying the Ulcer open to the <hi>Anus,</hi> and after ſeparation of the Eſcar, digeſted, incarned and cicatrized it: then made a ſearch with a Probe, putting my Finger in <hi>Ano</hi> the while, and feeling the Probe paſs into the Gut about an inch high, I prepared a Ligature, and with a Probe-needle paſſed it up into the Gut; then turned the end of the Needle downward under my Finger, and made a deligation, as in the like caſe hath been ſhewed, and applied a Stupe ſpread with <hi>unguent. nutritum</hi> over all. The next day dreſſing it again I found the part a-little heated, and a Pile that was before the making of the Ligature (lank and withered) ſwelled and beginning to inflame; wherefore doubting it might be troubleſome, I cut it off cloſe by the root, and rub'd it with a Cauſtick-ſtone to ſtop the bleeding, and conſume the remainder of it. Then I dreſſe up the Eſcars with a Pledgit ſpread with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and the <hi>nutritum</hi> over all. The fifth day I ſtreightned the Ligature again, and dreſſed it up with a Stupe ſpread with <hi>unguent. nutritum</hi> as before; and as occaſion offered I ſyringed the part affected with a <hi>Decoct. hordei,</hi> with a little Syrup <hi>de roſ. ſiccis.</hi> About the tenth day of the Ligature, I obſerved it cut ſo neer through as it was eaſy for me to divide the reſt by a ſnip of a pair of Sciſſors; yet in conſideration that the Ulcer was deep, and conſequently the Lips ſo cut, would lye high and be apt to receive Excrements, which might make it painfull and very troubleſome, I choſe rather to free my ſelf of them by rubbing through them with a Cauſtick-ſtone: which having done and flatted them as I deſigned, I pulled the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to me, and the while paſſed my Probe-ſciſſors under, and divided the <hi>Sinus;</hi> and pulling away the Ligature uncut, dreſſed up the Ulcer with a Pledgit dipt in <hi>baſilicon</hi> warm, and applied a Stupe wrung out of red Wine over it. After ſeparation of the Eſcar, I incarned and cicatrized with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. as aforeſaid.</p>

                        </note> having laboured long under Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Diſeaſes, with great irregularity in Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> during which, Nature to eaſe her ſelf, diſcharged ſome part of the Diſeaſe in an Abſceſs in his left Inguen, and another in <hi>Ano.</hi> This latter diſcharged a great quantity of Matter daily, and was exaſperated by a <hi>Diarrhaea.</hi> The former <hi>in Inguine,</hi> (he not permitting it to be opened by his Chirurgeon) had made its way through the Skin in many little openings, and lay ulcerated under it about three inches in length, and in no condition to cure. Doctour <hi>Tern</hi> was his Phyſician, and by his preſcriptions had oppoſed the various Symptoms that threatned the life of the Patient; but the Patient being ungovernable, I was called in, and ſeeing him much ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated and cachectick, not likely to be cured till he ſhould attain a better Habit of body, purpoſed to palliate theſe Ulcers a-while: that <hi>in Inguine</hi> by dreſſing it with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. diapomp.</hi> and <hi>cerat. dialtheae</hi> over it, whereby the Matter might be moderately diſcharged, and the Tumour mollefied, and rendred leſs ſubject to Fluxion.

I preſumed by this way of Inciſion the Cure would be the ſooner effected, and with fewer viſits from me; but the <hi>Sinus</hi> fill'd up with looſe Fleſh, and the Doſſills I left them to cicatrize it with commonly ſlipt out of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and lay uneaſy not unlike a Suppoſitory, putting her upon a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95669:125"/>
                        <hi>Teneſinus,</hi> and if the Injections were any thing abſterſive they did the ſame; ſo that to haſten the Cure I was obliged to dreſs it my ſelf, and dry the looſe Fleſh by rubbing the <hi>Sinus</hi> with the Vitrioll-ſtone; by which, and the Alum-ſtone, I at laſt cicatrized it.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman aged about forty four years,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano.</hi>
                        </note> having long laboured with a <hi>Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la in Ano,</hi> and a Tumour <hi>in Perineo,</hi> growing at laſt extreamly diſeaſed with it, was brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and ſent for me. The Tumour was <hi>in Perineo</hi> bigg, and ſeemed to me callous, it reached from the <hi>Anus</hi> to the <hi>Scrotum;</hi> and by the Matter I ſaw diſcharged from the <hi>Anus,</hi> I concluded the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was made by its inſinuating itſelf downward, and that through length of time it was grown callous. The compreſſion it made upon the <hi>Ductus urina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> cauſed a difficulty in Urine, upon which account my ſpeedy help was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. I began the Cure by laying this <hi>Sinus</hi> open by Inciſion, from the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> towards the <hi>Anus:</hi> in cutting it I found the <hi>Sinus</hi> ſmall, and the Matter in it little and thin, rather an Ichor; but the Lips were hard and thick, and did not much ſeparate one from another: wherefore having applied to a Doſſill ſpread with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> in the bottom of the <hi>Sinus</hi> to defend it, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Cauſtick-ſtone on each Lip, from the <hi>Scrotum</hi> upwards, and ſome hours after took it off; and finding it had penetrated the <hi>Callus,</hi> as I deſigned, I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it with <hi>Decoct. malvae,</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed it up with Lenients, after the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Eſcars I found that part freed of the <hi>Callus.</hi> I digeſted it with <hi>baſilicon</hi> and <hi>praecipitat.</hi> and with <hi>unguent. diapompholig.</hi> healed that Part. Then applied a Cauſtick upon the remainder reaching to the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and freed that alſo of its <hi>Callus,</hi> and diſpoſed it to cicatrize; which while I was I doing, made a ſearch with a Probe, paſſing it into the <hi>Anus,</hi> where I quickly diſcovered that about half an inch high the <hi>Sinus</hi> opened into the Inteſtine. It had run deep all the way, and here it lay deeper and more callous. Upon which conſideration I paſſed up a <hi>Speculum ani,</hi> and during the dilatation, laid it open with a Cauſtick-ſtone in my hand by rubbing it, then waſht out the Salts, and cut through the upper part of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors; that done, I injected ſome <hi>ol. lini</hi> to haſten the fall of the Eſcars: which being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I digeſted it with <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>praecipitat.</hi> and dried the Ulcer with the Vitrioll-ſtone and Pledgits dipt in <hi>aq. aluminis,</hi> and cicatrized at firm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him cured in few weeks.</p>
                     <p>I was fetcht to a Gentleman aged about fifty years,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano.</hi>
                        </note> who had been long diſeaſed with the <hi>Haemorrohoïdes,</hi> and ſeverall Apoſtemations the ſpace of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years; the Matter had paſſed through the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> into the <hi>Muſculi glutei</hi> making various fiſtulous Ulcers, but one in <hi>Perineo,</hi> which through length of time was encreaſed to a great bigneſs, and reached to the <hi>Scrotum.</hi> I began with that, by the application of a Cauſtick from the <hi>Scrotum</hi> upward, and divided the Eſcar; there iſſued out onely a little foul Gleet, which had flowed into it from within the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum.</hi> I dreſſed this Eſcar with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients, as in the former Obſervation hath been ſhewed: and as it ſeparated with the <hi>Callus,</hi> the <hi>Sinus</hi> appeared dry and hardned with thick Lips, lying not unlike a trough: therein appeared many Excreſcences, which put me upon the uſe of Eſcaroticks, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cauſtick-ſtone, Praecipitate, Alum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo by the uſe of the Vitrioll-ſtone I rubbed them off, and diſpoſed the Ulcer to cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize: then I applied a Cauſtick to the remaining <hi>Callus,</hi> which run up from thence to the <hi>Anus,</hi> the pain whereof ſtirred up a Swelling in ſome withered Piles. To prevent their inflaming, and to put them out of my way, I ſnipt them off cloſe by the roots, and after they had bled a-while, I rubb'd them with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and dreſſed them up with a Stupe of fine Tow, ſpread with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. baſilicon:</hi> having digeſted theſe, and diſpoſed this part of the <hi>Sinus</hi> to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95669:126"/>Cure, and the lower part (which I firſt began with) being cured, I made a ſearch into the remaining <hi>Sinus's,</hi> which lay on each ſide the <hi>Anus;</hi> thoſe I opened by Inciſion and Cauſtick, digeſted and cured them. Then I made a ſearch into the great <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> which had penetrated the <hi>Rectum</hi> about three quarters of an inch within, and paſſed a Ligature through it, and tyed it ſtreight. The while it was dividing, I fomented the <hi>Anus</hi> with red Wine daily, and caſt up Lenient injections, to eaſe the pain and cleanſe it: and after I found the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had made its way neer out I looſened it, and with a Cauſtick-ſtone rubb'd the remaining <hi>Callus</hi> off, for that by Inciſion it would have been long digeſting, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> would have lain deep, and the Lips troubleſome after the Cure. The <hi>Callus</hi> divided and the Ligature come away, the Eſcar ſeparated by Lenients and the Ulcer cicatrized: in very few days the bottom of the <hi>Sinus</hi> having been hardned by the <hi>Callus,</hi> remained as a ſmall guttur in ſpight of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the contrary; but it proved no great inconvenience to the Patient, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly well. And from that time following his Imployment daily abroad.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about forty years of age,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano.</hi>
                        </note> a ſtrong healthfull Perſon, of a Plethorique body, after a hard riding in hunting, was ſeized with a pain in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum;</hi> and a few days after with a Swelling and Inflammation about the <hi>Anus,</hi> which terminated in an Abſceſs, and was opened on the left ſide neer the <hi>Perineum.</hi> After two years the Abſceſs remaining uncured, the Patient came to <hi>London,</hi> and put himſelf into the hands of Sir <hi>Fr. Prujean,</hi> who recommended him to me: Sir <hi>Charles Scarborough,</hi> ſince Phyſician to his Majeſty, and to his Royall Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as alſo Doctor <hi>Warner</hi> were ſome time conſulted. There were two Sinuous Ulcers, one on the left, and the other on the right ſide of the <hi>Perineum;</hi> they had both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with one another neer the <hi>Anus,</hi> and paſſed up between the <hi>Anus</hi> and Bladder as we ſuppoſed, for we could not make a ſearch far up, till theſe were laid open: to which purpoſe I haſtened the dilatation of them by <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian-roots,</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards with Cauſtick and Sciſſors laid them both open; then by Digeſtion diſpoſed them to cure. That effected we met again, and I made a ſearch with a Probe up the main <hi>Sinus,</hi> and diſcovered it running between the neck of the Bladder and <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> above an inch high, but could not feel the Probe with my Finger in <hi>Ano:</hi> it was hoped the <hi>Sinus</hi> reached no further, but pulling out the Probe and bending it, I paſſed it up again by the rub I met with before, and diſcovered the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> at leaſt half an inch higher; and by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the end of the Probe towards the ſide of the Inteſtine, I did with my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there feel as I thought the end of the Probe, but at a great diſtance off, by which I well perceived it would be a difficult work to penetrate it, and bring the Needle out with my Finger, the <hi>Sinus</hi> being ſo high as I could ſcarce reach the end of the Probe with my Fingers end. It lay off ſuch a diſtance from the Inteſtine, as I could not paſs a ſmall Needle without a <hi>Cannula,</hi> and a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which was proper for the penetration of the Gut, would not ply enough to be returned out with my Finger by the <hi>Anus;</hi> and to lay a <hi>Sinus</hi> open of that length and thickneſs by a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, was very improbable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolved to dilate it, and try how I could digeſt off the <hi>Callus.</hi> To which purpoſe I dreſt it daily with a Tent made of a <hi>Gentian-root,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavoured to conſume the <hi>Callus</hi> by Tents made with Lint, and the white of an Egg cruſted with a mixture of <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and <hi>alumen uſt.</hi> over which I applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and a Stupe of fine Tow ſpread with a mixture of <hi>unguent. nutritum &amp; popul.</hi> over that: from that time I fomented the pained part daily with an Emollient Decoction, and repeated the Lenient applications, but removed not the Tent till it ſeparated with its ſloughs. Having thus waſted the <hi>Callus,</hi> I left off the uſe of thoſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95669:126"/>Tents and dreſſed it with others armed with Digeſtives, and ſhortned theſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: during this work the Patient drank a vulnerary Decoction, and took ſuch Balſamicks as the Phyſicians judged neceſſary. After I ſaw the <hi>Sinus</hi> well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and but little Matter, I left off the uſe of the Tent (leſt by keeping it longer open it ſhould skin again within) and in few days cicatrized it, but ſome while after it brake out again; and upon ſearch I found the <hi>Sinus</hi> open as at firſt. I attempted the waſting the <hi>Callus</hi> again; but ſeeing no good come of it, I tried by an Injection of <hi>aq. lap. Medicament.</hi> but that onely ſhrivell'd up the <hi>Sinus</hi> and might have been of good uſe to palliate: but my work being to cure, I dilated the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with <hi>rad. gentianae</hi> in order to the laying it open; and then calling in a Chirurgeon well experienced in this Art, who met the Phyſicians and my ſelf, he made a ſearch and concluded the way by Ligature proper. The Patient being prepared for the work, laid himſelf over a Chair: but when I came to paſs up the <hi>Cannula,</hi> the Patient grew ſo unquiet as my brother Chirurgeon deſired me to forbear, he ſuppoſing by the Patients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that it was cancerous; and adviſed me to proceed in the cure by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which I having no faith in, deſired the Patient that my brother Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon might bring his Injection, and dreſs the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> for ſome time: which accordingly he did ſome days; but ſeeing it unſucceſsfull, he then adviſed the Patient to retire into the Country, and content himſelf with a palliative Cure. But the Patient being ſenſible enough that the Cure was feaſable, if he could once reſolve upon it; wherefore he diſmiſſed the Chirurgeon, and ſometime after took new reſolutions and ſent for another, who was no leſs eminent in this Cure then the other; he came and made a ſearch, and approved of the dividing the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> by Ligature, and commended the way as both ſafe and eaſy: a day was prefixed, and the while I dilated again the <hi>Sinus</hi> with <hi>Gentian-roots.</hi> The day the operation was to be performed, the Patient dined abroad, and when we met and placed him in the light to proceed in our work, the <hi>Gentian</hi>-tent was fallen out, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> was cloſing; but we being reſolved not to loſe that opportunity, I dipt the <hi>Cannula</hi> in Oyl, and paſſed it up about an inch, but then meeting with the old rub, the Patient began to be troubleſome, and would have perſuaded us to deſiſt. The Chirurgeon ſuppoſing I was at the height, adviſed me to paſs the Needle; but I knowing the <hi>Sinus</hi> reached fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the inconvenience which might happen in the Cure by doing ſo, minded him not, but puſhing the <hi>Cannula</hi> upward as I had deſigned, till I felt the end of it with my Finger, which was the while in <hi>Ano:</hi> that done I put the <hi>Cannula</hi> into my brother Chirurgeons hand to hold there, while I paſſed the Needle into it, and through the Inteſtine to my Finger within, with which I bended the point of the Needle, and drew it out of the <hi>Anus</hi> with the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hanging at it. I then cut off the Needle with part of the Ligature, and having applied a fold of Plaiſter on the place, I tyed the Ligature ſtreight, and faſtned it with a bow-knot, and applied a Stupe of fine Tow, ſpread with a mixture of <hi>unguent. popul.</hi> and <hi>nutritum</hi> over it. The Patient being dreſt threw himſelf upon his Bed, my brother Chirurgeon told him the work was well done, and that he ought to account that day, as the day of his Birth, there being no hopes of Cure any other way; ſo took his leave. The Patient reſted very ill that night, and was the next day feveriſh, and continued reſtleſs by reaſon of the pain, notwithſtanding all my endeavours by Lenients. The third day after I was ſent for in great haſte, he being dying as they ſaid; I found him ſhrewdly alarm'd, he had newly voided three or four ſpoonfuls of Matter (as they called it) in his Urin; upon which it was concluded by them that I had wounded his Bladder in paſſing the Needle, and that I had paſſed it farther then my brother Chirurgeon adviſed. I was ſomewhat ſurprized at
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95669:127"/>their Language, and replied, there was a neceſſity of laying open the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> the whole length: looking in the Urinal I ſaw ſuch a quantity of thick Mattery ſubſtance, but could not imagine how I ſhould hurt the Bladder in paſſing the Needle; but there was no anſwering them. I caried the Urinall to Sir <hi>Fr. Pruj.</hi> he cauſed ſome of it to be heated in a ſpoon over a Candle, where it hardned, by which we were aſſured it was not Matter; he concluded it made in the Bladder, by the heat and diſturbance it had received from the Neighbouring parts. I returned to my Patient with the Phyſicians anſwer, which ſomewhat quieted them; but that expreſſion of my brother Chirurgeon had done me ſome prejudice, if the Patient had not recovered. Thus it uſually happens amongſt us in Operations, where they prove unſucceſsfull. From that time the Ligature made its way more eaſily, I taking more time in the cutting through the <hi>Callus,</hi> by which compliance it was above ſixteen days cutting its way out; all which time Injections were caſt up after his going to Stooll, and the Part affected was treated with Fomentations and Lenients, and at length the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made its own way out: during which the <hi>Sinus</hi> above cured, ſo as I had nothing to do but to cicatrize the outmoſt part, which I did with Lotions and Pledgits dipt in <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> &amp;c. in a few days after; and the Patient returned joyfully to his ſports in the Country, and relapſed no more.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to a Gentleman of about thirty ſix years old,<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of a putrid and fiſtulous Ulcer in <hi>Ano.</hi>
                        </note> much emaciated and of a very ill Habit of Body; he was diſeaſed with a painfull Tumour on the left ſide of the <hi>Anus,</hi> reaching from the <hi>Os coccix</hi> to the <hi>Perineum,</hi> of a dark red colour hard in the circumference, but along the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> it felt ſoft; it ſeemed to ariſe from under the <hi>Anus,</hi> and to be an ill-conditioned Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: I applied a Cauſtick upon the ſoft part according to the length of it neer the <hi>Anus,</hi> and ſome hours after divided the Eſcar, and gave vent to a a faetid brown Matter. I dreſſed the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilicon cum oleo terebinth.</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm over it of <hi>far. fabar. pulv. ſem. faenug. lini, flor. chamomel. ſambuci, roſ. rub.</hi> decocted in <hi>oxymel;</hi> as the Eſcar ſeparated the Ulcer ſhewed it ſelf putrid. I fomented it with a <hi>lixivium</hi> wherein good ſtore of wormwood had been boiled, and dreſſed the Ulcer with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. cum praecipitat. &amp; alum.</hi> and the Eſcar with Lenients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before.</p>
                     <p>This Patient had laboured ſome weeks of a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> which after the Eſcar was ſeparated flowed into the Ulcer, and much diſturbed our Cure; therefore I cauſed an Injection to be made of a <hi>Decoct. abſinth. hyperici, ſcord. centaur,</hi> &amp;c. to which I added <hi>ſpir. vini, mell. roſ.</hi> and <hi>unguent. Aegyptiaci;</hi> and that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements or <hi>ſordes</hi> might not be retained, and render the Ulcer more ſinuous, I cut it open the whole length above and below, and fill'd it up with <hi>Merc. praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitat.</hi> with the <hi>mundificative</hi> upon Doſſills, and with Plaiſter and Bandage retained them on. Then preſcribed him a <hi>Decoct. ſarſap.</hi> &amp;c. alſo an Electuary of <hi>conſ. roſ. rub. diaſcord. &amp; rheitorrefact.</hi> &amp;c. which he took once in four hours, and thereby ſtopped his looſneſs. The Ulcer not deterging with the former applications, I dreſſed it with <hi>pulv. Jo. Arden.</hi> and defended the Lips with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo</hi> over all. Thus in two or three dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings I conſumed the <hi>ſordes,</hi> then dreſſed it with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> and <hi>praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate;</hi> and applied Stupes of Tow over it preſt out of red Wine, wherein had been infuſed <hi>flor. roſ. rub. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards preſcribed him the taking of <hi>calomel.</hi> ℈j. every other night. Thus the Ulcer deterged, I incarned it with <hi>pulv. aloes haepat. myrrhae, ſarcocol. rad. ariſtoloch. rot. ireos florent. lap. calamin.</hi> made up into the form of an Unguent with <hi>mel roſ.</hi> While this was incarning, and in ſome parts cicatrized, a <hi>Sinus</hi> appeared running under the verge of the <hi>Anus</hi> about half an inch; I applied a Tent armed with the <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> and after it was deterged, left out the Tent and it cured. But then a ſmall <hi>Sinus</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95669:127"/>it ſelf on the otherſide of the <hi>Anus;</hi> upon ſight thereof, leſt more miſchief ſhould fall upon thoſe weak parts, (whilſt I attended the cure of that Sinuous Ulcer under the <hi>Anus</hi>) I dilated it, and ſnipt it open with a pair of Probe-ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors into that great <hi>Sinus,</hi> and from that time the Ulcer cured, and I thought my work had been done: but within a few days after another <hi>Sinus</hi> appeared neer the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> on that ſide where the former was; it much diſcouraged the Patient, but it lying ſo convenient for diſcharge of the peccant Matter, I continued it to further conſideration, it proceeding from the meer weakneſs of the part. I adviſed the keeping it clean, and to wear a dry Pledgit of Tow over it: It was kept with much eaſe, and the Patient enjoyed his health very well many years, and at length it cured of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour having ſome months laboured (as was ſuppoſed) under the Piles, being extremely waſted with the pain and accidents which attended it,<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of an Ulcer in <hi>inteſtino recto</hi> with ſtricture of the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                        </note> ſent for me to conſult with his Chirurgeon; I went, and there I alſo met Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> his Phyſician. The Patient diſcharged a purulent Matter <hi>per Anum</hi> as he lay in his bed, and in each Stooll a great quantity came away with his Excrements; on the left ſide of the <hi>Anus</hi> lay an Abſceſs perfectly ſuppurated, to which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently applied a Cauſtick, and gave vent to a digeſted Matter. I then made a ſearch with a Probe, and the while paſſing my Finger in <hi>Ano,</hi> felt the Probe in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> about an inch deep; I pulled it out and endeavoured by my Finger in <hi>Ano</hi> to find what <hi>Sinus</hi> or cavities there were, and felt one above the <hi>Sphincter</hi> in that part of the Gut lying next the Bladder: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Abſceſs was there, and that the Matter from thence had inſinuated it ſelf amongſt the Muſcles, and made that Tumour outwardly, which we had opened by Cauſtick. What it was that gave originall to that Ulcer, was not eaſy for me to determin, whether it was a <hi>Phyma,</hi> or a tranſlation of Matter from ſome other part: However it was, the Cure was difficult and depended upon a rectifying the Habit of body, it being by what I then felt out of our reach to lay more open; nor did I think it ſafe to be over-haſty in inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors there, I alwaies ſuſpecting the ſeminall Veſſells concerned in thoſe Abſceſſes, in which caſes Injections may dilate the Ulcer, and haſten its penetration into the <hi>Pelvis;</hi> therefore we dreſſed it up with Lenients to haſten ſeparation of the Eſcar: after the Eſcar ſeparated, we made a ſearch with a bended Probe, and turning it upward, found a cavity amongſt the Muſcles on that ſide; by which it ſeemed to us, that the laying that <hi>Sinus</hi> open into the former would be of no great advantage, we thereby could onely divide the upper part of the Abſceſs, and ſo make the firſt Orifice wider: yet it ſeeming ſomewhat advantageous to the diſcharge of Matter, we paſſed a Ligature through, and in few days divided that <hi>Sinus,</hi> and ſoon after cured it again; for the diſcharge of Matter continued very great <hi>per Anum.</hi> The Patient continuing weak and more indiſpoſed, Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſer</hi> was conſulted, who ſeeing ſuch a diſcharge of Matter <hi>per Anum,</hi> concluded that an opening ought there to be made in ſome externall part; we had ſeverall times endeavoured to find ſome place amongſt the externall Muſcles of the <hi>Anus</hi> and <hi>Glutei:</hi> and now again we raiſed the Patient upon his Knees in Bed to ſearch, but we could not by Fluctuation or otherwiſe diſcover ought, whereby we might be encouraged to apply a Cauſtick; whilſt he was in this poſture, the Matter poured forth, as alſo when he lay down in his Bed it came involuntarily out. We having in a former ſearch with a bended Probe, diſcovered a cavity amongſt theſe Muſcles beneath the former Abſceſs, it was reſolved that an opening ſhould be made there; but that cavity lay at ſuch a diſtance within, that it was not eaſy to reach it by Cauſtick: wherefore I having at my houſe an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proper to open Sinuous Ulcers ſo lodged, I ſent for an Inſtrument-maker,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95669:128"/>who upon ſight of that and the cavity we deſigned to pierce, fitted us with one ſomewhat like a crooked <hi>Forceps;</hi> one leg thereof we paſſed into the <hi>Anus,</hi> which being crooked turned up into the cavity, and being there, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhaft having a ſharp blade in the form of a great Lancet fixed in it, would at our pleaſure cut in upon the other, which was the Director: thus we cut into the Buttock from without inward, and that we might not loſe the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had made, we preſently paſſed a <hi>Fiſtula</hi>-needle through it with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature which we brought out <hi>per Anum;</hi> and having tyed the ends together, we faſtned it on one ſide with a ſnip of Plaiſter, and dreſſed up the wound with a proportionable Tent armed with a Digeſtive. From that time we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it daily towards the Buttock, to try whether the Matter would that way diſcharge. The Phyſicians preſcribed vulnerary Drinks, Balſamicks; Cordiall Bolus's and Juleps were alſo preſcribed, Lenients to appeaſe the <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> and ſomewhat of Injections we conſidered of to caſt up in ſome little quantity to heal the Abſceſs which lay above the <hi>Sphincter.</hi> After we had ſome-while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued that opening laſt made, and obſerved it painfull, and not to empty the Matter, nor divert it from flowing its wonted way, we cut it down to the <hi>Anus</hi> and cured it. From that time we applied our endeavours to cure the Ulcer within, whence (it was moſt certain) all the abundance of Matter iſſued. The method uſed was by detergent Injections, ſuch as have been propoſed in the Chapter of Sinuous Ulcers; but without acrimony to avoid a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> and in ſmall quantity at a time leſt it ſhould be retained and render the Ulcer more Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous. After we had thus ſpent ſome time ſucceſsfully, and by the Phyſicians help removed the ſeverer accidents; it was reſolved (the weather growing being warmer) that the Patient ſhould remove to <hi>Kenſington,</hi> and take the benefit of the freſh air, and obſerve a Milk-Diet, and proſecute his Cure there. Whilſt the Patient was weak and kept his Bed, and was vexed with <hi>Diarrhaea's,</hi> &amp;c. we could not obſerve any want he had of the retentive faculty; but being in the Country ſomewhat recovered, and walking daily abroad, he complained that he could not retain his Excrements, they preſſing almoſt continually forth. We went on our method in curing the Ulcer, and accordingly it contracted daily narrower, and the diſcharge of Matter grew leſs; but as the Ulcer cicatrized, he found his Excrements did not come away, but with great ſtraining, and thoſe that came away, were ſmall like Earth-worms: he alſo complaining of frequent pain in his Hips and <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> ſent for his Chirurgeon and my ſelf; we went and prevailed with him, to let us put up our Fingers dipt in a little Oyl, upon ſearch we found a ſtop about an inch or more within the <hi>Rectum,</hi> the Gut purſed up ſo cloſe, that I could not get in my Fore-finger to the firſt joint. This was by reaſon of the <hi>cicatrix;</hi> we cauſed preſently a Decoction to be made of <hi>rad. lilior. albor. altheae, ſem. lini &amp; hordei,</hi> to which was added ſome <hi>ol. ex ped. bovinis,</hi> and injected ſome of it: we directed the repeating of it often in a day, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Syringe full to be caſt in at his going to ſleep at night; we afterwards dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with Tents of <hi>Gentian-roots,</hi> and between while others of Deer-ſuet, ſome whereof were fitted with ſtrings. A conſultation was alſo reſolved on for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to meet us at, which time we came provided with a <hi>ſpec. Ani,</hi> &amp;c. in order to the dilating of the ſtricture: but the Patient would not admit it, he being eaſed by the uſe of the Emollient Decoction; but replied, if it again contracted, he would come to Town and be governed by us. Some months after the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter approaching, he returned to Town; his Excrements were ſuppreſſed, and his Belly ſwelling, his Urin alſo high-coloured and neer ſuppreſſed: his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians preſcribed him a Clyſter that Evening, and a Purging-draught of <hi>Decoct. caſſiae, tamarind. &amp;c.</hi> he omitted the taking of the Clyſter, but took the Purge the next morning, which bearing down the Excrements, ſo over-diſtended the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95669:128"/>
                        <hi>Colon,</hi> that the way between that and the <hi>Strictura</hi> being choked up by them, the Patient fell into a cold Sweat, and frequent fainting; but by laying him in his Bed, and Cordialls, he was ſomewhat relieved, and at laſt the Phyſick worked through him, and he grew better; and from that time he was more governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and admitted of Cliſters before Purging, both which he often repeated. We together proſecuted the Cure by internall Medicaments, ſuch as by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue reſtored the Patient to a better Habit of body: our work was the dividing the contracted <hi>Callus,</hi> which made the <hi>Strictura,</hi> which we did by an Inſtrument made for that purpoſe, with which without hurting the Inteſtine we cut through in ſeverall places, making the opening ſo large that the Excrements came away big; and by the injecting of <hi>ol. lumbricorum,</hi> cured the wounds in few days after, and left him at liberty, he not onely expelling them well, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo retaining them: Yet within this twelvemonth twice, we have enlarged it, and by the Inſtrument we deſigned, it may at any time be helped without hazard of wounding the ſound parts neer it; but ſince the laſt Inciſion of it, <hi>February</hi> 1673. it hath continued open, and upon a late ſearch with my Finger I could feel nothing of it.</p>
                     <p>A young Fellow of about thirty ſix years old,<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of a Sinuous Ulcer neer the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                        </note> a Servant to a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Country, was ſent to Town; he had been long diſeaſed with a ſuppoſed <hi>Fiſtula in Ano,</hi> it was on the right ſide neer the <hi>Podex,</hi> the Ulcer was ſordid and with round callous Lips. I made a ſearch and found it run under the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> but not penetrating it. He had been long diſeaſed of the <hi>Kings-Evill,</hi> there being many <hi>Scrophulae</hi> on both ſides of his Neck. I rubb'd the <hi>ſordes</hi> and putrid fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, and then filled it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> with Pledgits of Lint cloſe over it. Then applied ſome of my cauſtick Unguent upon a Pledgit round over the callous Lips, and with an <hi>Emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> and Bandage bound it up. The next day I took off the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and found it had worked as I deſigned: I dreſſed it with Lenients to haſten ſeparation of the Eſcar. This poor man had heretofore been ſubject to the <hi>Haemorrhoids;</hi> from which diſeaſe ſome withered Piles remained hanging upon the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> which upon the application of the forementioned Eſcaroticks and Cauſticks, began to heat and ſwell: I preſently cut them off with a pair of Sciſſors, and after they had bled a-while, dreſſed them with <hi>pulv. Galeni,</hi> and afterwards cicatrized them by the uſe of the Vitriol-ſtone and common Epuloticks. During which I cleanſed the Ulcer of its <hi>ſordes,</hi> and endeavoured to lay a <hi>baſis</hi> with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. &amp;c.</hi> for incarnating the Ulcer; but while I was ſo doing, I obſerved a great quantity of corrupt Matter flowing again down upon the Ulcer: upon ſearch I found a <hi>Sinus</hi> run towards the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> a great length, and ſo deep as gave me ſmall hopes of laying it open. The next Dreſſing I was provided with vulnerary Injections, ſuch as have been ſet down in Sinuous Ulcers, and dreſſed him up with Deterſives, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him ſuch Phyſick as might have regard to his Scrophulous Habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. While I was thus treating him, he began to be troubled with a cough, which he had been frequently ſubject to in the Country, upon which account Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls were preſcribed, and he was thereby relieved. The cure of the Ulcer not ſucceeding, I applied a Cauſtick upon the upper part of the <hi>Sinus</hi> between the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and the <hi>coccix,</hi> and paſſed in my Director at the ſame time, and cut through the Eſcar into it, deſigning by this opening to intercept the Humour flowing downward to the Ulcer, but the while he was taken again with a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of breath: I let him Bloud, and repeated the uſe of Lohocks and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls, with Spirit of Saffron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he took his Bed and died the third day after. I having leave to open him, deſired Doctor <hi>Walter Needham</hi> his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in finding out the Cauſe of his death; we found all the <hi>Glandules</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95669:129"/>very Scrophulous, thoſe that lay upon the <hi>Iliack</hi>-Veſſells ulcerated, from whence flowed a great quantity of Matter down into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> thence inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating it ſelf amongſt the Muſcles, and ſo to the place where I had applied my Cauſtick, and from thence to the Ulcer neer the <hi>Anus:</hi> his Lungs were alſo ſtuft with <hi>Strumae,</hi> and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> all very bad.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation being indeed ſtrumous, ſhould have been placed in that Treatiſe; yet notwithſtanding I thought it fit to inſert it here, that the young Chirurgeons, when they meet with ſuch ſordid Ulcers, with extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Matter, may learn to ſuſpect ſome extraordinary cauſe within.</p>
                     <p>A Lady of about ſixty eight years of age, a lean withered Body ſubject many years to the <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi>

                        </note> which in her declining years grew more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and at laſt afflicted her night and day, and being without hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the ſeverall applications preſcribed her, was perſuaded to admit of a Chirurgeon: She ſent for me, I heard her roaring before I came into her Chamber. On the lower part of the verge of the <hi>Anus,</hi> next the <hi>Perineum,</hi> was a Swelling as big as a Pheſants egge, it ſeemed to be the inflation of the rugous coat, but was hard and of a livid colour; but that which ſhe moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of was within, which I could not come to ſee nor yet feel: by preſſing this downward, I ſaw a foul Matter, and as I thought a large Ulcer; I cauſed a Syringe to be fetched, and ſome <hi>mel roſ.</hi> which I mixed with ſome Chicken-broth and caſt it up, and brought away ſome Excrements, and foul <hi>mucus:</hi> I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Fomentation to be made of <hi>fol. verbaſci, ſolani, plantag. an.</hi> M. j. <hi>ſem. lini</hi> ℥j. <hi>ſem. cydon.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>ſem. pſillii</hi>

Emollient Clyſters were alſo ſometimes injected with a Syringe, having a ſhort thick taper-Pipe; lenient Cerots were outwardly applied, made of ſome of thoſe aboveſaid mucilages <hi>cum ſevo cervin. vitulin. vitell. ovor. croco &amp; opio, cum ol. lumbric. &amp; cera alb.</hi> By theſe Medicaments I ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Patient, and got ſo much credit with her, as I hoped to have liberty to take off this Tumour by one way or other. Some while after I did apply a Cauſtick, and removed the upper part of it, as I deſigned: there came nothing out of it, but it was ſo levell'd, that I could with the help of a <hi>Spatula</hi> look into the <hi>Anus,</hi> where at ſome diſtance I ſaw little hard Excreſcences like <hi>Thymi</hi> ſtanding ſtiff up; theſe were they which gave her ſo continuall pain, eſpecially in the eaſing of nature. There was alſo a fordid Ulcer between them and the externall Tubercle, (to which I had applied the Cauſtick:) it was not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for to me extirpate the <hi>Thymi</hi> till I had quite removed this Tumour without; whereupon I preſently rubb'd it with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and laid it flat, and waſht it with the Emollient Decoction; then ſcarified the Eſcar, and fill'd it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and dreſſed it up with Lenients; afterwards I worked it down, and ſmoothed it with the Vitrioll-ſtone, and cicatrized it with Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the Alum-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This removed I began with thoſe <hi>Thymi,</hi> which if I might have had my own way, ſhould have been treated by the actual Cautery; but I did not mention it, nor did I acquaint them with what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, but placed her towards the light, and paſſed a Scoup-like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment up into the <hi>Anus,</hi> then having a Cauſtick-ſtone fixed in a convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, I preſſed upon the head of thencereſt <hi>Thymus,</hi> and as the Salts melted, dryed them up with an Armed-Probe, and continued the work till I had quite extirpated it; then caſt up ſome of an Emollient Decoction with a little <hi>ol.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95669:129"/>by which I cleanſed it well, and diſpoſed it to Cure by injecting <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> &amp;c.

He ſent for me ſuppoſing that he had a <hi>Fiſtula in Ano;</hi> I looked and ſaw the verge of the <hi>Anus</hi> callous, then ſearching with my Finger I felt a large cancerate Ulcer within the <hi>Rectum,</hi> lying under the <hi>Os coccix,</hi> and poſſeſſing the parts round with hard Lips; alſo a large Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, growing upon the lower part of the ſaid Inteſtine about an inch and a half within, ſo that there was but a ſmall paſſage for diſcharge of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>This was an inveterate <hi>Cancer,</hi> and not likely to yield any thing to Pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: I would gladly have been rid of him, but he would be my Patient, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that he could not live unleſs way were made for the more eaſy disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of nature; to which purpoſe he implored my ſpeedy help. I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his lamentable condition, and his reſolution to have ſomewhat attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deſired him to conſult ſome eminent Phyſicians and Chirurgeons; he aſſented to it, and made choice of Doctour <hi>Tho. Cox,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. We met at his Chamber the next day and made a ſearch, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it an inveterate <hi>Cancer</hi> incapable of Cure: but the Patient declared, he came to Town with reſolution to be cured or dye, and would have it attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We at his importunity complied, and reſolved upon the uſe of the actuall Cautery, as being the onely way whereby we could hope to extirpate theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences and callous Lips, he was well pleaſed with our propoſalls, and deſired we would meet again with what expedition might be. The ſecond day after we met, and came provided with an actuall Cautery of the faſhion of a bolt, with a <hi>Cannula</hi> having a hole cut in it to receive that great Excreſcence neer the <hi>Sphincter:</hi> a mucilaginous Decoction was alſo prepared <hi>ex ſummitat. malvae, viol. ſem. cydon. pſillii,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>aq. hordei.</hi> The Cautery being ready, and a baſon of Water with Sponges to cooll it; the Patient roſe out of his Bed, and placed himſelf towards the light, leaning upon the ſide of his Bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any body to hold him. I anointed the <hi>Cannula</hi> with <hi>unguent. refrigerans Galeni,</hi> and paſſed it up, placing the opening in the <hi>Cannula</hi> upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence; then paſſed in an actuall Cautery glowing hot, and repeated the uſe of it ſo often, till the Phyſician and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> judged the Excreſcence and callous Lips conſumed; Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> putting his Finger in after the paſſing each Cautery, the <hi>Cannula</hi> being the while taken out often and cooled in Water. The work done, Injections were caſt in, and the burnt parts dreſſed with Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; the Patient returned briskly to his Bed, and from that time diſcharged his Excrements freely, but made little Urine, and that high-coloured: by the uſe of Emulſions, and the frequent caſting in Emollient Clyſters and Injections, his Urin voided more eaſily, and in more quantity. After the ſeparation of the Eſcars, we dreſſed the Ulceration with <hi>unguent, tutiae,</hi> and injected <hi>troch. alb. rhaz.</hi> diſſolved with a Mucilage of the greater Cold Seeds, <hi>ſem. plantag. papaver. albi, pſillii, in aq. ſpermat. ranar. &amp; germ. querci.</hi> Theſe parts diſpoſing to cicatrize, the Patient was ſeized with a Pleuriſie, and not ſubmitting to be let Bloud as was preſcribed, his pain increaſed ſo very much
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95669:130"/>that he could ſcarce breath; being afterwards let Bloud about eight ounces, he was relieved: but then a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> followed, and it being Mid-winter, and the Patient not allowing himſelf Fire, nor obſerving good Diet, it terminated in a Dyſenterie, and he languiſhed and dyed.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Cure of the EVILL by the KING's Touch.</head>
                     <p>WHAT great difficulty we meet with in the Cure of the KING's-Evill, the daily experience both of Phyſicians and Chirurgeons doth ſhew. I thought it therefore worth my while to ſpend a whole Treatiſe upon the Subject, and very particularly to go through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, informing thereby the young Chirurgeon whatever is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Cure, at leaſt as far as it cometh within the compaſs of our Art. But when upon triall he ſhall find the contumaciouſneſs of the Diſeaſe, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deludeth his beſt care and induſtry, he will find reaſon of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the goodneſs of God; who hath dealt ſo bountifully with this Nation, in giving the Kings of it, at leaſt from <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor downwards, (if not for a longer time) an extraordinary power in the miraculous Cure thereof. This our Chronicles have all along teſtified, and the perſonall experience of many thouſands now living can witneſs for his Majeſty that now reigneth, and his Royall Father and Grandfather. His Majeſty that now is having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed that faculty with wonderfull ſucceſs, not onely here, but beyond the Seas in <hi>Flanders, Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> itſelf. The King of this laſt pretends to a Gift of the ſame king, and hath often the good hap to be alone mentioned in Chirurgicall Books, as the ſole poſſeſſor of it, when the <hi>French</hi> themſelves are the Authors: yet even they when they are a little free, will not ſtick to own the Kings of <hi>England</hi> as partakers with him in that faculty; witneſs the Learned <hi>Tagaultius,</hi> who in his Inſtitutions takes notice of King <hi>Edward's</hi> faculty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Cure, and the continuance of it in his Succeſſors. <hi>Italy</hi> as well as <hi>France</hi> hath made the like acknowledgments in the Book of <hi>Polydore Virgill,</hi> who reciting the Gift given to Saint <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, doth ſubjoyn theſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95669:132"/>words: <hi>Quod quidem Immortale munus quaſi haereditario jure ad poſteriores Reges manavit: nam Reges Angliae etiam nunc tactu, ac quibuſdam hymnis, non ſine cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniis, priùs recitatis, ſtrumoſos ſanant.</hi> 
                        <q>Which Immortall gift hath been deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as it were by an hereditary right to the latter Kings; for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> even now alſo do Cure the <hi>Struma</hi> by Touch,</q> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed if Hiſtorians of our Nation be diligently compared with the <hi>French,</hi> we ſhall find that the <hi>French</hi> Kings had this Gift later then ours. <hi>Dupleix</hi> a moſt diligent Writer of that Hiſtory, deriving it no further then <hi>Phillip</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the groſs; ſaying, that before their times no man had that power: whereas we on the contrary meet with the generall acknowledgments of all our Writers of the ſame miraculous Power in Saint <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, which were enough for this Controverſy: and not onely ſo, but with ſtrong ſurmiſes, that this Miracle was ancienter; it being notorious in the days of <hi>Malmsburien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> who lived not long after his Reign, that it was then diſputed, whether the Cure of the Evill were a peculiar reward of the Kings Holineſs, or rather a Hereditary faculty attending the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown. Which Gift, that it was not taken away upon our departure from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we have not onely our daily experience to teſtifie, but alſo the confeſſion of Doctor <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> a great Divine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion; who, after he hath in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> deſcribed at large the Miracle wrought by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, doth add, <hi>Quam ſtrumoſos ſanandi admirabilem dotem in poſteros ſuos Anglorum Reges, ad noſtra uſque tempora tranfudiſſe &amp; perpetuâſſe, meritò cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</hi> 
                        <q>Which admirable faculty of Curing the <hi>Struma,</hi> he is juſtly believed to have tranſmitted to his Poſterity,</q> the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and to have continued it amongſt them to thoſe times in which he wrote. And when Biſhop <hi>Tooker</hi> would make uſe of this Argument to prove the Truth of our Church, <hi>Smitheus</hi> doth not thereupon go about to deny the Matter of fact; (nay indeed both he and <hi>Cope</hi> acknowledge it) but he rather chuſeth firſt to retort upon him the Proteſtant argument againſt Miracles which they will not allow to be the neceſſary mark of a true Church, becauſe they may alſo be performed by Infidels. But withall he himſelf, who is not willing to let go ſo ſpecious an Argument from his own Church, finds another Solution of the difficulty, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to the great Goodneſs of God, and the great Grace of Saint <hi>Edward, Quòd nec in indigna haerede defecerit,</hi> that the Gift did not fail in an unworthy Succeſſour: Such as he calleth Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and adds, that She did perform that Cure, <hi>non virtute propriâ, ſed virtute ſigni crucis;</hi> not by her own virtue, but by virtue of the Sign of the Croſs, which ſhe made at the time of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; as if the Sign of the Croſs, by whomſoever made, were ſufficient to work a Miracle. What would he now ſay were he living, and had ſeen it done by three Generations of Kings without the Sign of the Croſs? But it is not my buſineſs to enter into Divinity-controverſies: all that I pretend to, is firſt, the atteſtation of the Miracles; and ſecondly, a direction for ſuch as have not opportunity of receiving the benefit of that ſtupendious Power. The former of theſe, one would think, ſhould need no other proof then the great concourſe of Strumous perſons to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and the ſucceſs that they find in it. I my ſelf have been a frequent Eye-witneſs of many hundreds of Cures performed by his Majeſties Touch alone, without any aſſiſtance of Chirurgery; and thoſe, many of them, ſuch as had tyred out the endeavours of able Chirurgeons before they came thither. It were endleſs to recite what I my ſelf have ſeen, and what I have received acknowledgments of by Letter, not onely from the ſeverall parts of this Nation, but alſo from <hi>Ireland, Scotland, Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Garnſey.</hi> It is needleſs alſo to remember what Miracles of this nature were performed by the very Bloud of his late Majeſty of Bleſſed memory, after whoſe decollation by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95669:132"/>the inhumane Barbarity of the Regicides, the reliques of that were gathered on Chips, and in Hankerchieffs, by the pious Devotes, who could not but think ſo great a ſuffering in ſo honourable and pious a Cauſe, would be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an extraordinary aſſiſtance of God, and ſome more then ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: nor did their Faith deceive them in this point, there being ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that found the benefit of it. If his dead Bloud were accompanied with ſo much of vertue, what ſhall we ſay of his living Image, the Inheritour of his Cauſe and Kingdom? whom though it hath pleaſed God to deliver out of thoſe dangers that overwhelmed his Royall father; yet it was with ſo long an exerciſe of afflictions, that though (God be thanked) he be not now like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the catalogue of Martyrs, yet he may well be added to the number of Confeſſours. This we are ſure, the Miracle is not ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>But ſince matter of Fact itſelf is, in ſuch difficult caſes as theſe, lyable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; I ſhall take notice of the Evaſions, that obſtinate and incredulous Men have uſed to avoid ſo great a notoriety of Experience. For ſince it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that many go away cured, ſome will impute it onely to the Journey they take, and the change of Air; others to the effects of Imagination; and others to the wearing of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is eaſily confuted by the hundreds of inſtances that are to be given of Inhabitants of this City, who certainly could meet with little change of Air, or indeed of exerciſe, in a Journey to <hi>White-hall.</hi> The ſecond is as readily taken off by the Examples of Infants, who have been frequently healed, though they have not been old enough to imagine any thing of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or other ſecret rays of Divinity, that do attend Kings, or do any other act that way to contribute to the Cure. The third hath more of colour in it, becauſe many that have been touched, have upon loſs of their God felt returns of their Malady, which upon recovery of that have vaniſhed. But in this caſe alſo we have many Evidences of the contrary.</p>
                     <p>For his Majeſty's Royall father in his great extremity of Poverty had not Gold to beſtow, but inſtead of it gave Silver, and ſometimes nothing, yet in all thoſe caſes did cure; and thoſe that were cured by his Bloud wore no Gold.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas upon the loſs of the Gold ſome have found damage; I would know, whether any of them were relieved by the wearing any other Gold then what the King gave them. This is certain, that many that loſt their Gold continued ſound; and whereas others did not, it may rather be imputed to ſecret Providence, which would give the Perſons concerned that obligation of being mindfull of their Benefactor.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the infidelity of many in this fantaſticall Age, and the want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of others, doth deprive them of this eaſy and ſhort remedy; and, ſince it is not neceſſary that a Diſeaſe, which is cured by Miracle, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable by no rules of Art; I think it will not be amiſs, if I do here give an account of what Nature and Art have ſupplied towards the relief of Mankind, in one of the moſt obſtinate Diſeaſes that I know: in the doing of which, though I think I ſhall ſay as much as thoſe have ſaid that have preceded me in this Employment, (it may be ſomething more;) yet I muſt needs profeſs that what I write, will do little more then ſhow the weakneſs of our ability, when compared with his Majeſtie's, who cureth more in any one year, then all the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons of <hi>London</hi> have done in an age. However that this Attempt may not ſeem to want precedent, give me leave to tell you, that it is no more then the <hi>French</hi> Kings Chirurgeons have done before me, or then old Mr. <hi>Clow's</hi> did in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, and all other generall Writers in Chirurgery have done more or leſs. Withall, as feeble as our Art is, this Treatiſe willſhew you that it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95669:133"/>is not altogether ineffectuall; and though the difficulty of Cure will ſufficiently appear, yet the poſſibility will alſo be made out in many remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Definition of the Diſeaſe, and it's Cauſes.</head>
                     <p>THE Latines call this Diſeaſe <hi>Struma</hi> and <hi>Scrophula,</hi> we the <hi>Kings-Evill. Galen</hi> defines it thus, <hi>Struma caro eſtſicca quae aegrè ſolvitur: Paulus</hi> thus, <hi>Strumae ſunt Glandulae induratae:</hi> Aetius, <hi>Strumae ſunt carnes ſubcandidae facilè augeſcentes, in membrana contentae, &amp; in ſumma glandula induratae, quae in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo &amp; ſub inguinibus oriuntur. Strumae</hi> are a hard Glandulous fleſh, ſomewhat white, contained in <hi>cyſtis, &amp;c.</hi> But none of theſe Definitions do ſeem to me ſufficiently to expreſſe the Diſeaſe which we in <hi>England</hi> call the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi> For I appeal to the practitioners of this Nation, Phyſicians and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, deſiring them to ſay, whether there be not many Tumours and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers commonly judged to be the <hi>Evill,</hi> which are contained in no <hi>cyſtis</hi> at all; neither do they concrete into a Glandule. I inſtance in the thick upper Lips chopt, divers Tumours by congeſtion in the muſculous parts of the Body, other in the Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that either we muſt exclude all theſe from the King's Touch, or alter our Definition: yet I do confeſs withall that the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Difference, whereby this Tumour is diſtinguiſhed from divers others, is ſo hard to find out, that it will be difficult to put a new Definition in the room of thoſe which I now reject. I ſhall endeavour to fix upon a peculiar Acidity in the <hi>ſerum ſanguinis</hi> for my ſpecifick Difference; and ſhall deſcribe the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> to be,<note place="margin">The Author's Deſcription.</note> 
                        <hi>a Tumour ariſing from a peculiar Acidity of the</hi> ſerum <hi>of the Bloud, which whenſoever it lights upon Glandule, Muſcle or Membrane, it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and hardens; when it mixeth with Marrow alway diſſolves it, and rotteth the Bone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this acid Humour be ſimple, the Diſeaſe is a ſimple <hi>Struma;</hi> if joined with a malignity, or any other Humour, it makes a mixt Tumour, as <hi>Struma maligna, Phlegmonodes, Schirrhodes, Oedematodes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now by a Coagulation I mean ſomething diſtinct from Concretion, which is incident to all other Humours and Tumours, and to the <hi>ſerum</hi> itſelf upon many other cauſes. The whole Blood being fibrous may admit of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions and thicknings; but they differ from this Coagulation as much as the boyling of Milk up to a thickneſſe, or their thickning it with Flower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differs from making a curd with Rennet. I ſhall the rather aſſume this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Milk becauſe of the near kindred between it and Blood, and alſo for the near reſemblance that many Strumous Tumours have with the curd of that. It is very common to ſee the leſſer Glandules of the neck, which of late have obtained the name of Conglobate, to grow large, and fill with a white curd ſo exactly like that of Milk that it is hard to diſtinguiſh them. When they differ from this, it is from ſome other mixture in the Blood which makes ſome other alteration; which may be very various, whether in the nature of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating Ferment, or of the matter coagulated: the former may be an Acidity
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95669:133"/>of this or that ſort, and ſometimes ſo ſharp as to approach near to the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>aqua fortis;</hi> in which caſes the Patient feels violent corroſions and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous pains, the Tumour it ſelf being apt to degenerate into a <hi>Cancer,</hi> or may have other mixture with it to make it of a Vitriolique or Aluminous nature: all which Acidities though they agree in the common notion of Coagulating, yet they make Coagulations very unlike each other. The difference alſo may be in the Matter coagulated, the varieties of which being infinite are hard to be recited: only I muſt take notice, that from this latter Cauſe it is that I was forced to put as well the property of Diſſolution as of Coagulation into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Diſeaſe; for though the Acidity be the ſame which cometh into a Bone with that which goeth into the Fleſh-glandule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it works upon being different, <hi>viz.</hi> Marrow, (whole peculiar nature we do not underſtand, only find it much different from other Juices of the body) it doth there diſſolve and rot it, and with it the fibres of the Bone itſelf. Let no man wonder at the contrary effects of the ſame Cauſe, who obſerveth the different operations of Fire itſelf upon wax and clay; where it is viſible that the contrariety of Accidents happens from the Matter, and not the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The like inſtance may be made in Vinegar, which when it is mixed with Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it coagulates it into a curd; if put upon an Egg, it not only diſſolves the Shell, but alſo attenuates the White contained in it into a limpid water; which White we notwithſtanding obſerve to be a body much apter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and grow thick then Milk itſelf. The ſimilitude will hold good of our Strumous Acidity, which when it lights upon the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulates it, and when it enters into Marrow, though that be in a nearer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition to Hardneſſe then the <hi>Serum,</hi> yet the mixture of this Acidity is ſo far from promoting that Hardneſſe that it rather diſſolves the conſiſtency it already hath.</p>
                     <p>The immediate Cauſe of the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> is delivered already,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>Serum:</hi> but the remote Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the cauſes of this Acidity (to which the <hi>Strumae</hi> owe their original) are ſomewhat hard to be enumerated. The heads to which they be referred are theſe, Air, Diet, Exerciſe, natural Complexion, hereditary Affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are born of Strumous Parents are uſually ſubject to theſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and derive it from them; ſo they will from a Nurſe ſo diſeaſed whoſe Milk they ſuckt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe whoſe temper of Bloud is acid and the <hi>Serum</hi> apt to coagulate, are very obnoxious: ſo are Rickety children, and indeed in all children the heat being little for concoction, the <hi>Serum</hi> is apt to coagulate.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that live in an Air exceſſively thin and ſharp, or very thick and foggy, are both liable to the ſame Diſeaſe. Diet of ſalt, ſowre and ſlimy meats are cauſes of this Diſeaſe, of which more elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Want of Exerciſe is a great cauſe of the Bloud's growing acid and ſlimy: external Accidents are often the occaſional cauſe of the <hi>Kings-Evill,</hi> but they always ſuppoſe a prediſpoſition of the Body to it; in which caſe we often ſee a blow, compreſſion, bruiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to produce it. So alſo by a wrench of the hip, knee, anckle, or other joint, we find crude Tumours to ariſe which are ſoon followed by viſible Symptomes of the <hi>Kings-Evill, viz.</hi> either glandulous Tumours in the Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Tumours of the Bones themſelves, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the body of them make the <hi>Spina ventoſa;</hi> of which elſewhere. I ſhall give you one remarkable inſtance of a Cook's ſervant in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> who ſleeping one Summers night upon a fourm, his head ſlipping off the one ſide of his Neck preſſed upon the end of it: when he wakened his Neck was full of <hi>Strumae</hi> on both ſides, ſome as big as Walnuts, others leſs; they were
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95669:134"/>of different figures, and diſtinct from one another. He was preſently let bloud and purged, all elſe was done that expert Phyſicians and Chirurgeons thought fit to relieve him; but the <hi>Strumae</hi> continued and after a few days apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and mattered, and became virulent Ulcers: he died tabid within half a year. A ſtreight ſtay, as ſome Women and Children wear them, hath too often the ſame effect: pain in the Breaſt makes them under the Arms, and in ill Habits of body; a ſore Leg hath often cauſed as much in the Groines.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> is already deſcribed in ſhort; but that will not ſerve the uſes of a young Practitioner unleſs he may have the Hiſtory of it more fully delivered, which cannot be well done unleſs we give an account of the Parts themſelves which are concerned in it.<note place="margin">Parts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Nerves and Brain.</note> Now the Parts uſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected are either Glandules, Muſcles, <hi>Viſcera,</hi> Membranes, Tendons or Bones. I do not remember ever to have ſeen the Nerves or Brain affected immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with any Humour of this kind: or if they have, the Juices of thoſe Parts are rather diſſolved, and the Fibres corroded by this Acidity after the likeneſs of Marrow and Bones, then coagulated into a Tumour; which Corroſion when it happens, the Diſeaſe gets another name, and being indeed mortal needs not be inſiſted upon in this Treatiſe, it admitting of no other doctrine but that of a Prognoſtick.</p>
                     <p>So a young Lady having overgrown Tonſills,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> which were judged Strumous, was cured by me by Extirpation, as you may ſee in the <hi>chap. of Tonſills:</hi> but ſhe ſome years after labouring under great pains of her Head, and being upon the way coming up to <hi>London</hi> for Cure, dyed ſuddenly; her Head being opened, her Brain was found corroded, and much waſted with great putrefaction, the inner Table of the Skull carious.</p>
                     <p>The Veins and Arteries do indeed dilate themſelves in all congeſtions of Matter,<note place="margin">Veins and Arteries.</note> whether natural or preternatural; but have not any particular Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Strumae</hi> diſtinct from what they have in other caſes.</p>
                     <p>Glandules are a very notorious ſeat of this Diſtemper, inſomuch that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours generally have confined it to them as its ſubject.<note place="margin">Glandules.</note> Here we have a great deal to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Part is the moſt commonly affected when-ever the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is Strumous; and if the outward and more viſible Glands remain whole,<note place="margin">Meſentery.</note> yet generally ſpeaking the inward ones, thoſe eſpecially of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, are obſtructed and ſwell'd. Of theſe I have ſeen divers examples, eſpecially in Children, and have paſſed my Judgment that they have been Strumous, when the outer Signs could not ſo far juſtify my conjecture as to make others of my mind: yet when the Patient hath been dead, the truth hath appeared upon diſſection. In one of this ſort Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been my witneſs. Nay whenever the outward Glands do appear ſwell'd, you may ſafely conclude the Meſentericks to be ſo too, they being uſually the firſt Part that is attacqued by this Malady. Nor is the Meſentery alone, but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95669:134"/>all the conglobated Glandules partake with it; which word <hi>Sylvius</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the reductive Glands that ſerve the Lymphaeducts.<note place="margin">Conglobate.</note> Theſe are frequently lyable to this Diſtemper, their offices being a percolation of the <hi>Serum;</hi> therefore whenſoever that is amiſs, theſe muſt needs ſuffer. This is outwardly viſible in the Neck, on the ſides of the <hi>muſculus maſtoïdeus</hi> quite down to the Clavicle,<note place="margin">Neck.</note> whence they paſs into the <hi>Thorax</hi> down a-long the Spine, and about the Lungs; which themſelves alſo do frequently abound with Strumous coagulations. <hi>Laurentius</hi> adds the <hi>Bronchocele</hi> as a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>It is as eaſy to be ſeen in the Groine, <hi>Axillae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Groines. <hi>Axillae</hi> Conglome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate more ſeldome.</note> &amp;c. in both which places they do often appear; but no-where more commonly and frequently then in the Neck, of which every day ſheweth examples. Nor are the conglomerate Glandules free of the like malady, under which name <hi>Sylvius</hi> contains all the excretory ones, which I do reckon to be the Salivalls bigger and leſs, the Tonſills, the <hi>Glandulae Lachrymales,</hi> the <hi>Thymus,</hi> the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> the <hi>Mammae,</hi> the Teſticles, Proſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſometimes affected together with the Conglobates, ſometimes ſeparably. Many inſtances may be given thereof, in ſome we have found all the conglobate Glandules of the Neck ſwell'd, and many of them to preſs hard upon and between the parts of the Salivalls;<note place="margin">Salivalls.</note> yet they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſound.</p>
                     <p>The like hath been ſeen concerning the <hi>Pancreas</hi> and <hi>Thymus,</hi> which have been both ſurrounded with <hi>Strumae,</hi> yet themſelves remained untouched; but very often the Conglomerates are affected by themſelves, of which we have a great example in the <hi>Ranula,</hi> it being but the Tumour of the <hi>Glandula ſalivalis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ranula.</hi>
                        </note> which in a man lyeth immediately under the ſides of the Tongue. The <hi>Parotis</hi> alſo, which is the external Salivall, is very often preternaturally affected; and in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> the learned Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> ſaith, he hath, ſeen a Strumous Tumour ſuppurated, which held a pint of matter when the other Glands of the Meſentery remained ſound.</p>
                     <p>The Breaſts are evidently obnoxious to it, as common practice teſtifies.<note place="margin">Breaſts.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a late private Healing I preſented a young Woman with one in the right Breaſt, and 3 near that lying between the 2 Breaſts, as large as Pheaſants eggs.</p>
                     <p>The Teſticles and Proſtates may be liable, but I cannot inſtance in them;<note place="margin">Teſticles and Proſtates.</note> and it may be that we do the leſs acknowledge their being affected with this Diſeaſe, becauſe we are apt in all theſe caſes to ſuſpect another diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The over-grown Tonfills are ſo frequently Strumous,<note place="margin">Tonſills.</note> that they need not be inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Glandulae Lachrymales</hi> are often infected, and do according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their diſorders produce ſeveral ſorts of Tumours about the eye; the moſt uſual of which is a <hi>Lippitudo,</hi> an affection of the ends of the Lachrymall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, which being derived from them do terminate near the <hi>cilia:</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Hordeoli,</hi> &amp;c. nay it is not rare to ſee the whole ball of the Eye thruſt out by the Tumour of theſe Glandules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> itſelf is often a conſequent of the Diſeaſe;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ophthalmia, Fiſtula Lachrymalis,</hi> Adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Glands, Face, Legs, Arms, Skin Muſcles, Membranes.</note> ſo is alſo the <hi>Fiſtula Lachrymalis</hi> which often oweth its original to this cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Beſides all theſe Glandules which are naturally born with us, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more which do ariſe upon the occaſion of this Diſeaſe in the ſeveral interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Muſcles, as I have ſeen in both the arms of one perſon now under my Cure near the <hi>muſculus biceps.</hi> The like happens to others in the Legs and Feet, alſo the very Fingers and Toes.</p>
                     <p>In a Child of ſix years of age I ſaw them ſcattering all over the Body, as in the balls of the Cheeks, and upon that part of the <hi>Os zygoma</hi> neareſt the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95669:135"/>externall <hi>canthus</hi> of the Eye, higher then the <hi>parotis</hi> reacheth: but whether that were part of the <hi>parotis</hi> or not, the others were certainly adventitious which appeared upon the ſides, back, breaſt, belly, ſhoulders, arms, and things, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering up and down, ſome ſuperficial in the skin, other deep.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Viſcera</hi> are often found with great <hi>Strumae</hi> growing in them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Viſcera.</hi>
                        </note> or from them. Nor are we to wonder at it if <hi>Malpighius</hi>'s doctrine be true, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth poſeth moſt of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> to be made up of Glandules. In them we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find Strumous Swellings as in the Liver, Lungs, Spleen, and ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants to them. Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> declared in one of his late Lectures of Anatomy at our Hall, that he ſaw a Strumous Swelling hang at the cone of the Heart that weighed 2 ounces.</p>
                     <p>The Tendons are ſometimes involved with a great gummineſſe and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Strumous matter, eſpecially the fingers, hands, feet and toes; yea upon the <hi>muſculus maſtoïdeus</hi> itſelf we find them very diſtinguiſhable from glandulous Tumours, and hard to be managed. Elbows, knees, anckles are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable Seats of this <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Bones are as frequently affected as any part of the Body, Glandules only excepted:<note place="margin">Bones cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from within.</note> but there the manner of the Tumour differs; for though the Bone ſwell, and the outward ſhell thereof appear hard, yet the inward Juices are all putrid and rotten. This ſort of Tumour is ſometimes called <hi>Spina ventoſa,</hi> how properly let others judge; but it is certain that not only the Bones of the fingers, <hi>carpus, metacarpus, tarſus, metatarſus,</hi> and Toes, are liable to this Evill, but alſo the Skull itſelf and the Jaw-bones, and all the other Bones of the body; the venomous nature of which will be ſeen by thoſe who upon ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome of theſe Tumours have found the Bone when laid bare at the firſt appearance ſound, but when pierced into to be in the heart wholly rotten.</p>
                     <p>Bones are likewiſe affected on the outſide by any Strumous Tumour that toucheth them;<note place="margin">Bones out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> whether Membrane or Tendon, &amp;c. which we often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in opening of them when they lie near ſuch parts; for when we do, we moſt commonly find the Bone itſelf bare, if not carious. There is a mixed caſe of Membranes and Bones which frequently is found Strumous, I mean the <hi>Ozaena,</hi> which requires your utmoſt diligence; the Bones and Cartilages there ſoon rotting, leave a blemiſh to the ſcandal of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>As to the Differences of the <hi>Strumae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differences.</note> they are ſometimes more mild with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Inflammation or pain, and moderately hard, but by acceſs of heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and ſuppurate; as well thoſe of a round figure, which is eſteemed the beſt and mildeſt ſort, as thoſe of any other. Some of the mildeſt and biggeſt <hi>Strumae</hi> I have ſeen perfectly ſuppurated without change of colour in the skin, but after ſome days they again became hard as before. When they ſuppurate with Inflammation then there is a mixture of Bloud with them, and then are call'd <hi>Phlegmonoïdes;</hi> others are indurated and after a while Schirrous, yet ſometime by a putrid heat do ferment, and grow painfull and ſoft in the upper part; which ſoftneſſe hath by ſome been miſtaken for a Suppuration, but at their Opening they only gleet, and at length too frequently ſhew their maligne qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by terminating in one of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a <hi>Cancer,</hi> as I have ſhewed you in the <hi>Chapter of Cancers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Other Differences may be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome are primigenial as when the Diſeaſe is original,<note place="margin">Other Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> and ſecundary when they ſucceed ſome other Diſeaſe, as particularly a Fever, which often terminates in a congeſtion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It alſo ſometimes happens after Catarrhs and other Diſtempers. There are likewiſe ſome by ſudden Fluxion, others by long Congeſtion. From the place of their ſcituation Differences may be taken which every mans eye can ſhew him.</p>

                     <p>Signs of theſe Tumours will be more difficultly given, by reaſon of the various ſhapes in which they do appear.</p>

Thoſe of an ovall figure which are hard, and accompanied with pain without Inflammation, are of an ill quality; and if they grow unequall they threaten a <hi>Cancer.</hi> When a Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate is the ſeat of it, it uſually obſerves the ſhape of that Glandule, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the whole Gland be diſeaſed: but it is not unfrequent to ſee thoſe Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules (which are indeed but compoſitions of leſſer Glandules cluſtered up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like a bunch of grapes) particularly affected; ſo that ſome of thoſe leſſer <hi>Glandulae,</hi> or Kernells, ſhall ſwell into ovall, round, or flat, or other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, leaving the remainder ſound enough; as indeed having no other communication with them, but only by that ſmall <hi>pedunculus</hi> which tieth them to, and diſchargeth them by, the common great duct of the Glandule.</p>
                     <p>In a Muſcle the ſhape is uncertain, and alway diſtinct from the Muſcle; the Tumour harder or ſofter as it happeneth: but thoſe of a round figure are the beſt-conditioned ones.</p>
                     <p>The lip when infected is commonly thick and chopt.</p>
                     <p>Bones when Strumous do ſwell, grow hard and big, but if you open them, they are found inwardly rotten, as hath already been hinted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe which we preſent to his Majeſty are chiefly ſuch as have this ſort of Tumour about the <hi>muſculus maſtoïdeus,</hi> or Neck, with what-ever other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they are accompanied; nor are we difficult in admitting the thick-chapped upper Lips and Eyes affected with a <hi>Lippitudo:</hi> in other caſes we give our Judgment more warily.</p>
                     <p>In the Prognoſtick you are to conſider, whether the Tumours be many or few, grown together in cluſters or more diſtinct, great or ſmall,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> deep or ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, moveable or immoveable, benigne or maligne, ſoft or hard: the place of them, whether neer great Veſſells, Joints, Nerves, Tendons or Bones, and the Habit of body, is to be conſidered; alſo the Age of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>If the Habit of body be tolerable, the Patient young, the <hi>Strumae</hi> recent and but moderately hard, the Reſolution or Suppuration of them is feizable: but if they have been of long continuance, are hard and lie deep amongſt the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, the work is difficult; yet the Cure of both is very often furthered by accidental Ferments, which will reſolve them to a wonder, and as often ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate them. In caſe of the King's Touch the Reſolution doth often happen where our endeavours have ſignified nothing; yea the very <hi>Gumata,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I am cautious of predicting concerning them (though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear never ſo bad) till 14 days be over. If the <hi>Struma</hi> be moveable, and free from remarkable Veſſells, the extirpation is not difficult; but if the Habit of body be bad, the <hi>Strumae</hi> immoveable, they are not to be meddled with; if that they be moveable, yet lie deep amongſt the great Veſſels, the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is dangerous: beſides, in the beſt Habits of body new <hi>Strumae</hi> are apt to ariſe while you are extirpating the old ones.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Strumae</hi> have been long ulcerated, and are become ſinuous and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,<note place="margin">

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95669:136"/>one another, though to your Eye they may ſeem diſtinct: in which caſe the Lips grow callous and the Ulcers corroſive, yea frequently ſordid, and the Cure not to be hoped as long as any one <hi>cyſtis</hi> remains, or indeed the Veſſells that feed them; and if they run under the great Veſſells what will you do? but if the Ulcerations be ſimple the Cure is accordingly eaſy.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Method of Cure.</head>
                     <p>IN the Cure of the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> you muſt conſider the Habit of body, ſtrength and age of the Patient, the affection of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and particularly whether the <hi>Struma</hi> be ſimple or complicated.</p>
                     <p>If all things appear benigne according to the Diagnoſtick or Prognoſtick before delivered, you may hope well; if otherwiſe, then you are to defend your ſelf with a prediction, and work warily.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure three Intentions are required. The firſt conſiſts in the regiment of Diet and the other non-naturalls; the ſecond, in Pharmacy or internall Preſcriptions; the third, in the application of Externalls either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe, ſuppurate or extirpate the Glands.</p>
                     <p>In the firt concerning a generall regiment of Diet, <hi>amp;c.</hi> there ought to be ſpecial regard had of the Conſtitution of the Patient whether he be hot or cold, dry or moiſt, old or young, tough or tender and waſhy. If the Body be cold and moiſt, we generally ſuppoſe a <hi>crapula</hi> preceded, and crudity to abound; in which caſe the ready road is by Faſting from meat and drink, which was the method of the Ancients, or at leaſt great moderation: their Diet ought to be moderately heating and drying, Mutton, Kid, Rabbet, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Chicken, Partridge, Pheaſant, Cock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe roaſted; avoiding all meats which yeild a groſſe nouriſhment, as water-foule, fiſh and herbage:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95669:136"/>their Bread ought to be of wheat well baked, and their Drink medicated ale or beer; wine is alſo allowed and water utterly forbidden.</p>
                     <p>In hot and dry Bodies which are tending to a Hectick, we allow a more humecting Diet, their meat boyled with Lettuce, Spinage, Purſlane, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſome of theſe we dare ſcarce permit the eating of any Fleſh, but rather a Milk-diet or Aſſes milk; but where Milk doth not agree we preſcribe them medicated Broths.</p>
                     <p>Air is a great help in our Cure: in the cold ones it ought to be moderately heating and attenuating, in the hot ones cooling; in neither over-much pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as that of <hi>Hampſted</hi> is, in which ſort of Air there is always ſomething eſurine and acid; but rather mild and gentle, as that of <hi>Kingſington,</hi> upon which ſuppoſition of gentleneſs, the farther removed from the ſmoke of the City the better. I ſhall mention one Obſervation which I leave to your Judgement, whether it ought to be attributed to the ſmoke or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern blaſts from <hi>High-Gate.</hi> It was in a Patient of Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> and mine, diſeaſed and waſted even to skin and bone: we removed him to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> where after in ſome weeks he had a little recruited his ſtrength, and was eaſed of his Cough, which had been very grievous to him; we removed him (for more conveniency of curing an Ulcer with <hi>caries</hi> of the <hi>cranium</hi> which he had ſome time laboured under) to a Lodging near <hi>Kings-Gate</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> which ſtood backwards and Airy enough, the windows opening to the Fields. Upon lying there but two nights he relapſed to ſuch a degree, that if I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved him the third day I verily believe he could not have ſurvived the fourth; but at <hi>Knights-bridge</hi> he again recovered, and ſome weeks after went well away to his Parents in the Country, and hath continued health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſince.</p>
                     <p>Exerciſe of body ought to be enjoined, it being neceſſary to waſte ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; Sleeping in the day is forbidden, unleſs it be in caſe of pain to which it is an Anodyne; Paſſions of the mind ought alſo to be modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention conſiſting in Pharmacy, muſt be qualified according to the Habit of body. If it be cold and flegmatick, abounding with groſs viſcous Humours, your Preſcriptions ought to be heating and attenuating: in Plethorique bodies you muſt purge with the ſtronger Catharticks, or repeat the milder often, otherwiſe the Diſeaſe will be apt to increaſe under your hand.

You muſt endeavour a perfect Concoction; for if you open them while any part of the Gland is hard, it will increaſe and put you upon a neceſſity of eradicating it, or of leaving your Cure imperfect. I could give you many inſtances of Patients that have come to me for Cure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch Treatment. As to the way of opening them when ſuppurated that by Inciſion makes the leaſt Scar; but if the <hi>Struma</hi> be large, the way by Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick may give you more Opening, and with leſs pain aſſure the Cure: the Matter being diſcharged you may deterge with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. praecipitat.</hi> and the Vitrioll-ſtone, and afterwards incarne and cicatrize as in crude Abſceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>But in the old and hard <hi>Strumae</hi> we do ſeldom obtain a compleat Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſometimes during the application of the moſt ſubtill Diſcutients we raiſe a heat in the Skin, which affecting the <hi>cyſtis</hi> and part of the Gland next under it doth cauſe an imperfect Suppuration: by the continued uſe of the Diſcutients it at length frets its way through in ſmall Apertures, in which caſe if you continue the Applications, they grow bigger and become ſo many pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ulcers ſpreading one into another, the body of the Gland remaining hard without hopes of Suppuration. But if you dreſs them a day 2 or 3 with a Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> you may qualifie the Heat and moderate the Ulceration; and ſo by interchangeably applying the Diſcutient or Lenient, you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily waſte the whole Gland, if the Patient be treated the while by proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternalls. In ſome of theſe who have come to me out of the Country with <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae</hi> ulcerated about the Chops, I have ſeen the <hi>Strumae</hi> thruſt forth in a <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> ſo that with my <hi>Spatula</hi> paſſing under them I have thruſt them quite out, and healed the Ulcer in few days: in others where they are incapable of being ſo ſoon thrown out, I cut off the protuberant part, and conſumed the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>baſis</hi> with Eſcaroticks.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Struma</hi> be moveable, and free from remarkable Veſſells, the ſpeedieſt way of Cure is by cutting the Skin, and taking them out whole with their <hi>cyſtis:</hi> thoſe which have ſtalks and are pendent, or grow ſmall near the <hi>baſis,</hi> may be tyed and cut off; of this ſort we ſee many. The laſt I was conſulted in was as big as the largeſt <hi>Catharine Pear</hi> and of that ſhape, growing on the outſide of the thigh of a Woman: I made a Ligature about the <hi>baſis</hi> of it, and and in complyance with the Patient left it on, and deferred the cutting it off till the next day; but when I came I found it rotted off by force of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and required no Dreſſing, I cut it in pieces and found it a white Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous body. In an Infant newly born there appeared one upon the outſide of her little Finger, of the perfect ſhape and colour of an unripe Cherry, partly red and partly pale, with a ſtalk proportionably long; I cut it off with a Knife, it bled with a full ſtream, I ſtopt it by the application of <hi>pul. Galeni cum alhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ovi;</hi> the third day after I took off Dreſſings and ſaw it healed. About ten days after coming thither to make a Fontanell, I ſaw that Cherry lying in a Box in the window: I cut into the ſoft part and diſcharged a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95669:138"/>
                        <hi>ſerum:</hi> the other ſide which gave the pale colour to it was a Glandulous fleſh.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe which are ſo thick in the <hi>baſis</hi> that you cannot make Deligation on them, you may paſs a proportionable big Needle under the roots of them, and cut them off under the Needle.</p>
                     <p>The common way of taking out all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Strumae, Atheromata,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The way by Inciſion.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp; Meliceris,</hi> by Inciſion, is in cutting the Skin the length of the Tumour: in theſe latter you muſt make the Inciſion more warily, leſt you divide the <hi>cyſtis</hi> and the Matter flow forth. After you have ſeparated them round to the <hi>baſis,</hi> it may be ſometimes neceſſary to make a Ligature upon the Veſſells before you cut them off. Thoſe which are of great bulk and have their <hi>baſis</hi> proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably big, as <hi>Steatoma,</hi> generally called <hi>Wenns,</hi> are ſometimes taken out by making a croſs Inciſion, other-while by an ovall, one taking off ſo much of the Skin as may be judged ſuperfluous; then ſeparate it, proceed calmly in the Work, for in theſe the Skin commonly adheres ſo cloſe to the <hi>cyſtis,</hi> that it will not part from it without the help of your Knife: having ſeparated it turn it out, and make a Ligature underneath upon the Veſſells, and cut it off; then bring the Lips of the Wound together with 2 or 3 ſtitches, and dreſs it up as you ſee cauſe. Some Empiricks cut them off without more adoe, ſcarce making a Ligature on them; but this way being always attended with a flux of Bloud, others chuſe rather to paſs a Seton-needle with a ſtrong Ligature cloſe under the <hi>baſis,</hi> or as near it as may be, and that way make a Ligature ſtrictly about it. Sometimes we make the like Ligature without Inciſion, and are content to eat off the Tumour by ſtreightening it. Thus it falls off without effuſion of Bloud; but hereby there is hazard in mortifying the ſound parts underneath, or of cauſing ſuch diſturbance as prolongeth the Cure: upon which conſideration I do propoſe in great <hi>Steatoma</hi>'s and complicated Tumours, which are incloſed in <hi>cyſtis</hi>'s, rather to cut into the <hi>cyſtis,</hi> and with your hands to pull out that preternaturall Body, and leave the <hi>cyſtis</hi> behind. So ſhall you be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from a flux of Bloud, and for the <hi>cyſtis,</hi> you need not doubt but by Digeſtion it will ſeparate and caſt off; the Wound will alſo heal ſmooth by Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination afterward, if you cut off the ſuperfluous Skin, and bring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Lips together, as in ſuch Operations is uſuall. An Inſtance of this I ſhall give you amongſt the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner I uſually treat all thoſe Tubercles in the Eye-brows and Face, where the <hi>cyſtis</hi> ſeparates difficultly from the circumjacent parts, or where a great Scar may be unſightly.</p>
                     <p>Where the <hi>Strumae</hi> are large or lie deep near conſiderable Veſſells, there,<note place="margin">Extirpation by Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> if Extirpation be ſafe, the beſt way will be by cauſticall Medicines and Eſcaroticks. It is a Work requiring more time, yet it is ſure; and indeed is the only way our Patients generally admit of. The very mention of a Knife frighting them from us.</p>
                     <p>In preparation to this Work, the Body ought to be frequently purged, and if there be <hi>Plethora</hi> Venae-ſection may be neceſſary: alſo during the Extirpation they ought to be in an Antiſtrumaticall courſe of Phyſick with Alteratives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been already preſcribed; otherwiſe new Glands will ariſe whilſt you are eradicating the old ones. Upon which conſideration you are to furniſh your ſelf with ſuch Eſcaroticks as may penetrate deep into the Gland, and do their work with leaſt pain: for theſe Glands have ſmall ſprigs of a Nerve branching through them, which maketh them ſenſible of Pain and ſubject to Fluxion; therefore it is that we endeavour to eradicate them with Corroſives leaſt painfull. But ſuch is our misfortune that all Medicaments fit for this Work are extremely painfull, the ſtronger Cauſticks are moſt proper to begin with upon condition that they be kept within their bounds: of theſe ſome are made up of Sope-lees boyled to a Stone, but this Medicine will ſpread in ſpight of all our Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives;

                     <p>In the eradicating of <hi>Strumae,</hi> we are ſometimes neceſſitated upon an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall eroſion of an Arterie to apply the ſtrongeſt Eſcaroticks; but generally we qualifie them according to the Habit of Body, Age and Strength of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and condition of the Glands, as they are hard or ſoft, have more or leſs ſenſe, or are ſeated in or near an Emunctory. In my long Practice in eradicating theſe Glands, I have experimented all the ſeverall Eſcaroticks and Cathereticks aforementioned, and know that thoſe Compoſitions which have Sublimate in them are exceeding painfull, ſcarce to be endured in the ſtrongeſt Bodies, although you do take them off in 5 or 6 hours after; yet the Salts having once penetrated the Glands, the Pain will continue vehement many hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and affect the neighbouring Parts with great Inflammation and Tumour, and ſo frequently raiſeth new Glands: but when you apply theſe to the ſofter Sex, or tender Bodies, it affects their Head with grievous pain benumbing that ſide and parts about, depriving their very ſenſes. Fainting, and palpitation of the Heart, are frequent effects of ſuch Eſcaroticks, and not ſeldom a Fever; by which may be judged the ill conſequence of applying ſtrong Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roticks of Sublimate indiſtinctly to all Complexions and Ages.</p>
                     <p>The Method I uſually begin this Work with is by the application of ſuch a Cauſtick as will leaſt ſpread, making it proportionably long, reaching from the loweſt part of the Gland upward; for in the conſuming it, the <hi>Strumae</hi> will ſink downwards: you muſt defend the ſides with Plaſters that it do not ſpread; for the Lips being once divided they will give way, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as your Eſcaroticks penetrate into the body of the Gland, the ſides of it will fall in and be eradicated out of the narroweſt Opening you can make; and the narrower it is the leſs Blemiſh will ariſe from the <hi>cicatrix,</hi> and the ſooner it will be cured. The Eſcar being made you may divide it the whole length, and with a Cauſtick-ſtone rub into it till it hath penetrated into the body of the Gland, which it will the ſooner do if interchangeably you preſs into the ſame place with a ſtick dipt in <hi>ol. vitrioli.</hi> Having thus done, dreſs it up with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum oleo lini</hi> hot, embrocating the parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> and apply an Emplaſter <hi>è bolo</hi> over all. This way of Dreſſing is not without pain, but it ſeldom laſts above half an hour. The third day after you may dreſs it again, and if you find the Eſcar in the middle dryed hard, I dreſs it with Lenients: but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95669:139"/>if it feel ſoft rub it again interchangeably with the Cauſtick-ſtone and <hi>ol. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioli,</hi> thruſting them every was into the body of the Glands, taking care that the Lips of the Ulcer be not enlarged thereby: by this way of proceeding a great part of the <hi>Struma</hi> will be eradicated before the firſt Eſcar in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference caſt off from the Skin. Having thus neer eradicated the <hi>Struma,</hi> you may conſume the Remainder with <hi>Merc praecipitat.</hi> and keep it open by Doſſills of Lint; permitting the Lips of the Ulcer to contract narrower the while, that it may heal with a <hi>cicatrix</hi> like an inciſed Wound. This I conclude the eaſieſt and ſpeedieſt way to eradicate the largeſt <hi>Struma:</hi> but in theſe complicated <hi>Strumae,</hi> and others which will not admit of ſuch proceeding I apply an Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or the ſtrongeſt Catheretick powders as I ſee cauſe; of which proceeding you may ſee more particularly in the following Obſervations. The <hi>Steatoma</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuet yeilds not to Eſcaroticks.</p>
                     <p>All this while I have treated only of the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> as it is contained in a <hi>cyſtis,</hi> being the <hi>Struma</hi> of the Ancients: but in my Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe I have enlarged the bounds of it further, ſo as to take in ſeverall Tumours and Ulcers upon Muſcles, Tendons, Ligaments and Bones; alſo <hi>Ophthalmia, Aegylops, Fiſtula Lachrymalis, Tonſillae, &amp;c.</hi> which cannot be reduced to this Method here propoſed: yet that concerning Muſcles, Tendons and Bones being more univerſall, and happening in ſeverall parts of the Body, eſpecially the Joints, I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of in this place; the other I ſhall be forced to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in diſtinct Chapters, and place them in the latter end of the Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Strumae,</hi> and other preternaturall Tumours included in a <hi>cyſtis,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Muſcles, Tendons, Ligaments and other parts of the Body, they differ not in the way of Cure from what hath been already delivered, ſave that they require more caution in the Extirpation of them as they affect the Joints or ſenſible Parts.</p>
                     <p>The Ulcers ariſing from theſe are cured after the ſame manner that hath been ſhewed in that Treatiſe; for whatever ſome Authors may have pretended of this or that peculiar Remedy, the Cure depends upon the generall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod there propoſed, to which if your fancy ſo lead you may add Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks.</p>
                     <p>The gummineſs upon the Muſcles and Tendons require emollient and diſcutient Dreſſings, as in the Chapter of <hi>Sehirrus</hi> hath been demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>The Swellings affecting the Joints in this Diſeaſe are of 2 ſorts:<note place="margin">Swellings of the Joints are of 2 ſorts, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and Internall.</note> both of them are made by Congeſtion, and increaſe gradually; yet differ in that the one ariſeth externally upon the Tendons, and between them and the Skin, or between them and the Bone; the other internally within the Bone it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>That which ariſeth externally affecteth the Ligaments and Tendons firſt, and ſometimes relaxeth them to ſuch a degree that the heads of the Joints fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeparate from one another, and the Member emaciates and grows uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But for the moſt part the Humour over-moiſtning the Ligaments and Tendons produceth a weakneſs and uneaſineſs in the Joint, raiſing a Tumour externally, and in progreſs the Membranes and Bones are corroded by reaſon of the acidity of the Humour; yet it is much haſtened, if upon a Suppoſition of a diſlocation they conſult the Bone ſetters.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure you ought in the beginning of the Fluxion to apply Emplaſters of an aſtringent and drying faculty, <hi>empl. de minio, è bolo caeſaris, &amp;c.</hi> with moderate Bandage, and place the Member in ſuch a poſition as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the deſcent of Humours. If Bloud abound Venaeſection may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but this Humour requireth Purging with <hi>calomel. &amp;c.</hi> and Alteration by
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95669:140"/>ſpecifick Decoctions, <hi>antimon. diaphoret. bez. minerale, &amp;c.</hi> In the declining of the Fluxion you muſt ſtrengthen the Joints by Fomentations and Emplaſters of a diſcutient and aſtringent quality, <hi>ſummitat. hyperici, centaur. abſinth. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joranae, betonic. flor. ſalviae, anthoſ. roſ. rub. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſi, bacc. myrtill. juniperi, &amp;c.</hi> in Wine with the addition of Brandy and Emplaſter <hi>de ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, &amp;c.</hi> But if through want of ſuch a Treatment they grow exceſſively ſwelled, and the Humour incapable of being preſſed back or diſcuſſed, you may ſhrewdly ſuſpect the Bones corroded: for that Swelling is for the moſt part raiſed by an <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> within, and ought not to be opened without a prediction of a <hi>caries;</hi> for however it may by a ſeeming Fluctuation be thought to have Matter, yet upon Opening it will only diſcharge a Gleet, and the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> will thruſt out in a <hi>fungus.</hi> If in ſome particular part there do viſibly appear Suppuration, and upon Aperture there do diſcharge an albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Matter, you may conclude the Bone under it is rotten, eſpecially if it be hand or foot: and the longer you delay the Opening the more rotten the Bones will be.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in ſuch caſes make your prediction of the danger, and give vent to the Matter proportionably large (according to the rectitude of the Veſſells) to the Bone, and proceed in the Cure as in Ulcers with <hi>caries,</hi> being carefull to keep the Member in a right poſition that the Joint above it do not contract, as it frequently happens in the Elbow, Knees and Hip. It ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that thoſe diſeaſed creatures fall into the hands of pretenders to Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who by improper Applications raiſe great Tumours, and unadviſedly open them; and not knowing how to dreſs them ſuffer the Aperture to be fill'd up, and over-grown with luxurious Fleſh till the Bone rot underneath. It is alſo as uſuall in ſome others of our Profeſſion, when conſulted in ſuch caſes, (although they know the Bones to lye carious underneath that <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi>) to adviſe the leaving them to nature, perſwading their Patients that it is the work of Time, and that the aſſiſtance by Chirurgery will but increaſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. But be aſſured one rotten Bone cannot caſt off another, they may well rot in pieces; but untill the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> be removed, and the Bones laid bare, you can expect nothing but Apoſtemations one after another, and your Patients at length will die Hectick. Therefore when you ſhall be called to ſuch deplorable caſes conſume that <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> by ſuch Applications as their ſtrength can bear, and make way to the Bone or Bones, and pull out ſuch as are looſe, and diſpoſe the other to exfoliate; then by Compreſs and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage preſs out the Matter, and endeavour to reſtore the part to its naturall ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which that you may do, the Ulcer muſt be well deterged, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat cheriſhed by diſcutient and drying Fomentations as aboveſaid. The Compreſſes under the Bandage ought alſo to be preſſed out of a Solution of <hi>ſal nitri, &amp;c. in aceto.</hi> But this Method you may happily cure them, if Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls be the while preſcribed with regulation of Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other ſort of Abſceſſes which take their beginning from an Ulcer in the Bone, I have already mentioned in the generall Deſcription of the Diſeaſe under the name of <hi>Spina ventoſa:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spina vento. ſa.</note> it hath been taken notice of by very few Authors, and I my ſelf ſucceeded happily in the curing thoſe in the leſſer Bones, many years before I knew what to call the Diſeaſe. And in truth I do not now great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve of the Name, but ſhall acquieſce in it, and repreſent it to you as I have frequently ſeen it in my Practice in the <hi>Kings-Evill,</hi> it being a certain <hi>ſpecies</hi> of that Diſeaſe, and of no other that I ever ſaw.</p>
                     <p>It taketh it's beginning from a thin acid <hi>ſerum</hi> in the medullary Juice,<note place="margin">It's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> which corroding the Fibres maketh a ſolution of continuity there, and at length corrupteth the interior part of the Bone, and at laſt (if not prevented) cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95669:140"/>the Shell, and paſſeth it's ſubtill Humour through ſome poroſity it had made.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe of the interior part by degrees uſually ſo affecteth the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Shell of the Bone, as to raiſe it to a preternaturall Tumour, which at the ſame time overſtretching the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> cauſeth an uneaſineſs; and this Pain if it grow ſo acute as to produce Inflammation, an Abſceſs conſequently followeth.</p>
                     <p>If the Bone be ſpungy and ſoft, it is wonderfull to ſee how quickly the Fibres of it will be mollified by the influence of the <hi>ſerum</hi> of the Bloud, and made apt for a ſudden Diſtenſion, as if the part were rather muſculare then Bone. So in childrens Fingers I have ſeen a Bone ſwelled in a night, and the like Tumour raiſed in the ſpongy Bones of elder perſons in few days, and without much difficulty to yeild again to exſiccant Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Yet it ſometimes happeneth that the interior part of the Bone is totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted without any externall Tumefaction or Pains, till the acid Humour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth its way through the <hi>cortex,</hi> and eroding the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> cauſeth a Solution of continuity there; which by acceſs of pain ſwelleth and inflameth the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Parts, and produceth Maturation in few days. Thoſe in the protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant Bones do alſo frequently raiſe Abſceſſes after the ſame manner, and ſometimes whilſt the exteriour Parts ſuffer under another Ulcer different from this: But of that hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Somewhat of their Differences I have ſhewed you in the preceding lines,<note place="margin">Differences.</note>others may be taken from the Quality of the <hi>ſerum.</hi> In ſome there is a ſudden Tumour raiſed in a night, in others it ſwelleth gradually and never corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth externally. In others the Humour pierceth through the <hi>cortex,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuddenly an Abſceſs. And theſe Differences may be ſaid to ariſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the Place or Bone they affect; for accordingly as the interiour part of it is ſofter or harder, or the externall <hi>cortex</hi> is ſolid or porous, ſo it ſuffers Solution ſooner or later. Thoſe of the <hi>cranium</hi> for the moſt part paſs their way through the interiour <hi>lamina,</hi> and affect the <hi>dura mater, &amp;c.</hi> producing great Pains, Convulſions, <hi>Spaſmus,</hi> Epilepſies, and they die before the Diſeaſe is diſcovered. In the great Bones of the Knees, Ancles, Elbows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they paſs their Matter ſlowly, and are more generally diſeaſed with Apoſtemations, externally ariſing from the protuberance of them. In the <hi>Os tali</hi> or Heel-bone which is ſpungy within and full of externall pores, they make their way through more ſuddenly, and ſo accordingly they do in the Jaws, Fingers and Toes.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> I have already delivered you in ſhort to be the Acid quality of the <hi>ſerum ſanguinis</hi> in the Bone.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> The moſt viſible Signs of it are a protuberance of the Bones without diſcolouring of the Skin, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without Tumour or Pain.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtemations proceeding from the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> do moſt certainly ſhew them, they riſing always between the Membranes and Tendons; and ſomewhat of Fluctuation may be felt there before the externall Skin be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably inflamed: alſo if upon Opening it you make ſearch with a Probe, you will find it penetrate deep into the Bone, yet is the <hi>cortex</hi> of it white; whereas the other Abſceſſes do always begin externally, and if the Bone be bare, yet is it only ſuperficially carious or ſtained by the Matter.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> in the leſſer Bones, as the <hi>Cranium,</hi> Jaws,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> Fingers and Toes is feaſable; but thoſe in the bigger Bones are for the moſt part deplorable. Infants and Children are generally the ſubject of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of theſe the ſame Method is required which hath been above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed<note place="margin">Cure.</note>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:95669:141"/>in thoſe Abſceſſes and Ulcers with <hi>caries;</hi> as alſo the ſame regulation in Diet and other non-naturalls.</p>
                     <p>The Topicks ought in the beginning to be ſuch as are aſtringent and drying, as hath been ſet down in Abſceſſes, <hi>viz. empl. è bolo caeſaris, comitiſſae, deminio ſimp. &amp;c. cum ſapone, de ſandicis, &amp; de ranis duplicat. mercurio,</hi> with good Bandage.</p>
                     <p>If afterwards they paſs their Matter externally they muſt be laid open by Inciſion according to the length of the protuberance. Thoſe of the <hi>Cranium</hi> are not much protuberant for the reaſons aforeſaid, yet you ought to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and proceed accordingly by Rugine or Trepan as the Symptomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate. Thoſe of the Jaws are viſible, and require vent by extraction of the Teeth, after which the <hi>caries</hi> muſt be conſumed by Medicaments of a drying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of which the actuall Cautery is the moſt ſpeedy and effectual. Thoſe of the Fingers and Toes are to be laid open by Inciſion in caſe of Apoſtemation the length of the protuberance, and the Bone cut into, and the <hi>caries</hi> dryed up. The Ulcers in the greater Bones ought alſo to be opened, that the Matter may be diſcharged, and the Bone laid bare in order to Exfoliation, (if it be poſſible;) but if the interiour part be much corrupted, your beſt way will be to keep that part of the Ulcer dilated which lyeth over the Aperture in the Bone by ſome Doſſill dipt in <hi>ſp. vini</hi> or the like, and heal the reſt of the Ulcer, and preſcribe ſuch Internalls as may diſpoſe the Body to a better Habit. For theſe only are the carious Bones which we may leave to time, it being in vain to attempt the Exfoliation of great Bones where the rottenneſs, as in a Pear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the core hath conſumed the ſubſtance of them. How all theſe are particularly treated by me, you may ſee in the following Obſervations of Ulcers with <hi>caries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee ſhall begin our Obſervations with the reſolving of <hi>Strumae,</hi> which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is a work of Time, and in thoſe which ſuffer under internall Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> it is not ſo advantageous to their healths: upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I for the moſt part endeavour to waſte them by Maturation, and the while preſcribe Internalls ſuitable to the Habit of body and complication of the Diſeaſe; for if in reſolving them the <hi>Viſcera</hi> grow more diſeaſed, it will be imputed to that, and if new <hi>Strumae</hi> ariſe the Patient will grow weary and be eaſily perſwaded to conſult others, who ſometime get the credit of the Cure when the foundation was laid to their hands; wherefore I do not readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this Work till they have tryed others, and can willingly ſubmit to my endeavours.</p>
                     <p>AN Infant about a month old,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Diſcuſſion.</hi>
                        </note> the only ſurviving child of its Parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to Fermentations of ſharp Humours breaking out in the head, face and body, and frequently affecting the internall <hi>Viſcera,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to my care, I made a Fontanell in its Neck, and purged it with <hi>ſyr. de rhab.</hi> once in 4 or 5 days, and on the intermitting days gave him a few grains of <hi>bez. minerale</hi> in a ſpoonfull of white Bread and Milk: his ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat was made in a Decoction of <hi>ſarſa, raſ. eboris,</hi> &amp;c. In caſe of Catarrh or Cough I preſcribed him my anodyne Syrup; ſometime the acid Humours affected his bowells with a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> (eſpecially in breeding his Teeth:) to remedy which we preſcribed <hi>diaſcord. cum pul. rhab.</hi> &amp;c. Thus each diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance was leviated, and the Child thrived. In his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. year he fell into the ſmall Pox, and was helped through it by Dr. <hi>Tho.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95669:141"/>with a Cap made of a Bladder. It was eaſy for me to have cured all the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Skin with Externalls, but I thought it ſafer to cure them by ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Bloud. The laſt Symptome which appeared was a ſwelled upper Lip, at ſight whereof I purged him again as aforeſaid, and diſcuſſed the Swelling. This method of purging with <hi>infuſ. rhab.</hi> &amp;c. he continueth to this day, and hath thereby recovered a ſtrong healthy Habit of body.</p>

She ſlept well that night, and went to Church the next day modeſtly dreſſed. The night following ſhe complained of ſome indiſpoſition, and was griped, ſhe alſo vomited and purged often. She continued ill 3 days before I had notice of it. Then Dr. <hi>Dand</hi> and my ſelf went to her, and found her in bed, ſubject to a Vomiting and a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> with frequent excretion of a <hi>Mucus.</hi> We direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clyſters of Milk <hi>cum vitellis ovor.</hi> we alſo gave her a morſell of an Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of <hi>diaſcord. ceruſſa antimon. conſ. roſ. rub. confect. alchermes,</hi> as it is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Treatiſe of <hi>Lues Vener.</hi> in ſuch caſes.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95669:142"/>ſhe had taken at Church. Two or three days after I received a Letter, that ſhe was ſeized again with a Vomiting and Griping in her Bowells. I carried the Letter to the Phyſician; who concluded her Diſtemper to ariſe from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive quality of the Mercury. I replied, it would not then have ceaſed upon our Preſcriptions: beſides, her Chaps muſt then have been ſoar, which they were not. I concluded, that the Humours drawn inward by her Purging, being checked as aforeſaid, ſtill affected her Bowells, and required to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged off. To which purpoſe I reſolved to carry with me 2 quarts of <hi>Barnet</hi>-water to purge her. I accordingly went early the next morning, boil'd it with Milk, and diſſolved ſome Manna in the firſt draught. She vomited that preſently. I gave her more of the ſame Water, and plied her with it till ſhe had drank it all. She vomited much green Choler with viſcous Phlegm, and her Stools were frequent and bilious. A Clyſter was given her of Milk and Yolks of eggs; and that night I laid her to reſt with an Anodyne draught. She ſlept well, had a good Stool in the night, and ſlept again. She eat a boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chicken in the morning, and from that time was no more griped. I ſtayed 2 days, and, ſeeing no Relapſe, came away. This was all the ill I ever met with in the giving <hi>Merc. dulc.</hi> and upon ſuch ill regulation every Cathartick would have done as much.</p>
                     <p>A Woman of about 36 years of age,<note place="margin">1.

In the ſpace of 3 weeks it ſuppurated it, and fretted a hole, by which the Matter burſt forth. I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and <hi>empl. diachyl. ireat.</hi> as it is preſcribed in the method of Cure. There remaining ſome hardneſs after the diſcharge of Matter, I applied again the <hi>Malagma,</hi> which cauſed a Suppuration of the remainder: which being permitted to flow forth, I dreſſed it with Lenients as aforeſaid, and thereby cured the Abſceſſe, without inlarging it by Knife or Cauſtick.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about 4 years of age, being internally diſeaſed with a Cough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2.

But about a year after he returned to Town diſeaſed with a large <hi>Struma</hi> on the ſame ſide of his Neck, and internally obſtructed with the ſaid Diſeaſe. Antiſtrumaticks were preſcribed as formerly in order to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe Obſtructions; the <hi>Struma</hi> was ſuppurated, the Matter let out, and the remaining body eradicated, the Ulcer alſo diſpoſed to cicatrize.

                     <p>A Man of about 25 years of age, much emaciated with the <hi>Kings-Evill,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Struma</hi> ſuppurated.</note> being internally obſtructed, was commended into my hands. He had externally on the right ſide of his Neck a great Cluſter of <hi>Strumae:</hi> ſome of them were inflamed, and inclinable to ſuppurate; others lying amongſt them, and ſcattering about, were pale and hard. I applied over the whole Tumour ſome of the Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſet down in the method of Cure; and having concocted the Matter, where I found it at firſt inflamed, I applied a Cauſtick the whole length of the Bunch, taking in ſuch a breadth as might ſerve for the eradicating of the reſt. Then dividing the Eſcar, I gave vent to the Matter, and dreſſed it up with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95669:143"/>During the digeſting of it, I purged him with an Infuſion of Sena, Rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and put him into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lign. lentiſc. ſantal.</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>milleped.</hi> and ſome of the antiſtrumatick Plants, and preſcribed him <hi>Calomel.</hi> with ſome of the milder Purgatives to be taken once in 4 or 5 days. After ſeparation of the Eſcar, I ſaw the Ulcer lying unequall, and by ſearch of my Probe found <hi>Sinus's</hi> running under one another, ſome of them deep under the Muſcles. They ſeemed to be made by the unequall Suppuration of the Glands. Some of the deepeſt <hi>Sinus's</hi> I dreſt with Doſſills ſpred with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and Praecipitate, others I dipt in Praecipitate; ſome I rubbed with the Cauſtick-ſtone, others with the Vitriol-ſtone; then covered all the Ulcer with Praecipitate, and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over all. After I had thus eradicated thoſe <hi>Strumae</hi> moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, I divided ſome of the uppermoſt <hi>Sinus's</hi> with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and kept the Lips dilated with Doſſills dipt in Praecipitate, till I had waſted thoſe Lips: then I made way to the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> and laid them all open, with Eſcaroticks ſmoothing the Ulcer; and raiſing a baſis of good Fleſh, I cicatrized the Ulcer even. After I had cured him, I continued the proſecuting of the foreſaid Courſe of Phyſick with ſome of the milder Specificks, and directed him to drink Aſſes milk; which he did, and thereby recovered his ſtrength, and appetite to ſtronger nouriſhment. About 2 months after, this perſon came to me, complaining of that ſide of his Neck. Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, we both looked upon the place where the <hi>Strumae</hi> had been lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſaw that Part and the Clavicle down to the head of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> much leaner then the other ſide. I made him a Fontanell in that lame Arm, and adviſed the embrocating the extenuated Parts with <hi>axung. humana cum guttis aliquot ol. lavendulae:</hi> by the uſe whereof it plumpt, and he enjoyeth a good health to this day.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about 45 years of age came to me with a round Tubercle (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflammation) between the Sagittal and Coronal Suture.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Inciſion of a <hi>Melice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
                        </note> I opened it by Inciſion, and diſcharged firſt a yellow <hi>Serum,</hi> then a gritty Matter like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I wiped away the bloud, and preſſed out the Matter; then dreſſed it with Doſſills ſpred with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> dipt in Praecipitate, and thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted out the <hi>Cyſtis;</hi> and cured it ſoon after by the common method.</p>

I laid it open by a ſnip of a pair of Sciſſors, and deterged, incarned and cicatrized them both according to the uſuall method of curing ſuch Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman came to me one evening with a <hi>Steatoma</hi> a little above the Coronal Suture.<note place="margin">3.

                     <p>A Child of about 3 years of age was brought out of the Country to me with a <hi>Struma</hi> on the left Eye-brow,<note place="margin">5.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95669:143"/>dreſſed it up as aforeſaid. The ſecond day after I left off the uſe of Doſſills, and, bringing the Lips together, dreſſed them up with the common Sarcotick, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by uniting them in a few days, and returned the Patient cured with a ſeemly <hi>Cicatrix.</hi>

I dreſſed it with a Doſſill dipt <hi>in albumine ovi &amp; pulv. Galeni,</hi> and with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> and Bandage bound it up. The next day the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid being very much ſwell'd, I embrocated the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> then let her bloud, preſcribed a Clyſter at night, and an Anodyne draught.

I made Inciſion into the Skin according to its length, then ſeparating it, faſtened a Ligature under it, and cut it out, leaving the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to digeſt off. I dreſſed it with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum empl. è bolo.</hi> After Digeſtion I deterged, incarned and healed it as hath been ſhewed in the former Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A Young man aged 24 years was brought to me,<note place="margin">8.

After various endeavours by internall and externall Remedies, he was commended into my hands by Sr. <hi>Fra.

There diſcharged a Matter not unlike the White of an egg, upon which the Tumour ſunk.

                        <hi>Sarcoma</hi> on his lower Lip, conſulted me with Dr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> an eminent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of the City of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> It had been formerly attempted by Eſcaroticks and by Exſiccants; but it returned, and thruſt forth Excreſcences, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not unlike a Strawberry. They were accompanied with Tumour and hardneſs, and would not cicatrize by any Application, but grew up, and ſpred under a cruſty Scab, which frequently fell off of it ſelf. We reſolved upon the extirpation of it. To which purpoſe the Dr. prepared his body by Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then in order to the work, the Patient being placed in a Chair to the light, I marked out ſo much as I deſigned to cut off; then took hold of the Lip between my Thumb and Fore-finger, and preſſing the <hi>Sarcoma</hi> outward, I cut it off with a pair of Sciſſors: upon which I ſaw the remaining roots ſtart up in a ridge of looſe Fleſh.

                     <p>A Woman about 30 years of age had a ſmall Gland of the bigneſs of a Lupine upon her left Cheek a little above the lower Jaw.

I dreſſed it with a Digeſtive <hi>ex te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinth.</hi> &amp;c. deterged with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and afterwards cicatrized it with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and diſmiſſed her cured.</p>
                     <p>A Youth about 12 years of age had a <hi>Struma</hi> of an ovall figure on his right Cheek,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of Inciſion.</note> lying movable between his Jaws, and moſt capable of being taken out on the inſide within his Mouth. I made Inciſion upon it there, and with my fingers pull'd it out, then waſht his Mouth with Oxycrate: but it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to bleed, I fill'd the Wound with Doſſills of Lint, and placed a round Boulſter dipt in the foreſaid Oxycrate between his Teeth and Cheek: I alſo applied externally a Compreſs ſpred with a Defenſative with Bandage; by which the bleeding was reſtrained. I took out the Boulſter in the morning from between his Cheek and Teeth, and permitted him to waſh his Mouth with a tincture of Roſes with <hi>ſyrup. diamoron,</hi> and the ſecond day after took the Doſſills out of the Wound: but ſuſpecting that the way of dreſſing it with them might prolong the Cure, I clipt off the lower Lip with a pair of Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and preſcribed him a ſanative Lotion of <hi>fol. plantag. virg. aur. alchimillae, piloſellae, rad. conſolid. &amp; liquiritiae, cum ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis:</hi> by the uſe of which it cured in few days.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about 30 years of age had an <hi>Atheroma</hi> on his left Cheek,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of Inciſion.</note> which at length made its way externally through a ſmall Orifice, and healed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It growing vexatious to him by its frequent eruptions, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my hands at a time when it was full of Matter. I, feeling the Tumour big within between his Jaws, made a large Inciſion into it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a foul Matter with dregs, which ſhewed it a <hi>Meliceris.</hi> I put my finger into it, and with a Knife in my other hand cut off the neareſt Lip as
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95669:144"/>far as it was hollow, and preſcribed him a <hi>decoct. ſummitat. equiſeti, veronicae, biſtortae, rad. iridis, conſolidae,</hi> &amp;c. to waſh his Mouth: by which he was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and from that time relapſed not.</p>
                     <p>A poor fellow of about 40 years of age came to me with a large white Tumour upon the right Cheek reaching cloſe to the tip of his Ear,<note place="margin">15 Obſervat. of Inciſion.</note> ſuppoſing it was the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi> I put my finger into his Mouth, and feeling it big within, and the Matter fluctuating, I thought it Atheromatous; yet for more ſecurity opened it by Puncture. It diſcharged a bloudy <hi>Serum.</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to empty it ſelf, (it being towards evening) and contented my ſelf in ſtopping it up with a Tent of Lint dipt <hi>in albumine ovi,</hi> applying a reſtrictive Emplaſter and Bandage on the externall parts. The next morning, finding the externall Tumour ſunk, I took out the Tent from within, enlarged the Opening, and thruſt out a foul Matter like dregs of Beer. I cured it in few days, after the ſame method that hath been ſhewed in the former Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>A Tradeſman aged about 30 years came to Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and my ſelf (while we were dreſſing a Patient in the City) with a large ſoft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour within his right Cheek near his Mouth, much diſtorting it,<note place="margin">16. Obſervat. of Inciſion.</note> ſo that it hindred him in eating his Victualls: it was overſpred with a <hi>Varix;</hi> which ill aſpect, I ſuppoſe, had deterred the Chirurgeons whom he had conſulted from meddling with it. But we concluding it a Species of an <hi>Atheroma,</hi> I ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by Inciſion by the ſide of that <hi>Varix,</hi> and diſcharged a proportionable quantity of <hi>Serum,</hi> and cruſht out a Cheeſie ſubſtance. Then conſidering that the over-ſtretched Lips of the Abſceſſe would by falling between his Teeth be very troubleſome, I cut them away, laying the Abſceſſe open: after which I gave him Water and Vinegar mingled together, to waſh his Mouth, and preſcribed him <hi>decoct. veronicae utriuſque, ſalviae, betonicae, flor. roſ. rub.</hi> with a Solution of <hi>mel roſ.</hi> to gargle it: and by the touching it ſometimes with a Vitriol and Alume-ſtone, it was deterged and cicatrized in few days; his Cheek alſo contracted, and became naturall as the other.</p>
                     <p>A Man of about 24 years of age came to me with a very large ſoft Tumour under his upper Lip near his Noſe, with very great deformity.<note place="margin">17. Obſervat. of Inciſion.</note> He had tried the endeavours of the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons in the Country by internall and externall Remedies, and earneſtly deſired my help. I, concluding it Atheromatous, propoſed the opening it: which he ſubmitting unto, I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Knife deep into it, and gave vent to at leaſt a Bloud-porrenger full of ſerous Humour. Upon conſideration of the quantity, I made a ſearch with a Probe, and felt a large Opening into the Cavity of the <hi>Maxilla ſuperior;</hi> but ſuppoſed nature would diſpoſe it to heal, if the Orifice were a while kept open. To which purpoſe I immediately inlarged the Orifice by Inciſion the whole length of the Abſceſſe, and gave him of the Decoction preſcribed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obſervation to waſh his Mouth. He ſtay'd 3 or 4 days in Town, and ſhewed himſelf to me. The Abſceſſe being well diſpoſed to cure, I permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to retire to his houſe in the Country, and proſecute that method. Whilſt he was there, the Orifice cloſed, and the Part grew painfull and ſwelled again; upon which he returned to me. I opened it, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a well-concocted Matter, keeping it dilated with a Tent dipt in <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis.</hi> By this way of dreſſing the agglutination of the Ulcer was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Abſceſſe was drained. He returned back into the Country, and I ſuppoſe was thereby cured; for I heard no more of him.<note place="margin">18.

                     <p>In the time of the laſt great Sickneſs, whilſt I was in the Country, a young Woman was brought to me who had a large unequall Tumour near her Neck, movable, and without Inflammation. I, deſigning to take it out by Inciſion,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95669:145"/>prepared Dreſſings ready, and had 2 Women, and a Boy that I had taken to attend me that Journey, preſent to aſſiſt me. During the ſeparation of the Skin from the Wound, it bleeding, my two Women left me, and the Boy dropt down in a Swoon: the Patient alſo growing froward, and the work of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration being not very eaſy, I was put upon a neceſſity of cutting into the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> the whole length: in the doing of which there diſcharged about half a large Porrenger-full of <hi>materia purulenta:</hi> after which, putting in my hand, I pulled out a hard body of Suet. It was a <hi>Steatoma,</hi> and weighed 9 ounces and a half. Then I fill'd the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> with Stupes of Tow dipt in a mixture of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> hot; and bringing the Lips of the Wound over it, applied an <hi>emplaſtr. è bolo,</hi> with convenient Bandage, to retain the Dreſſings, there being no appearance of its bleeding. The fifth day after I returned thither again, and dreſſed it as before, the Wound digeſting well. The fourth day after, dreſſing it again, and ſeeing the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> lie looſe, I pull'd it away with the Dreſſings; and perceiving the Wound within freſh, I brought the Lips flat over it, and healed it in few days by Agglutination. I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the leaving this <hi>Cyſtis</hi> behind when I began the Operation; but am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that it is the eaſieſt and moſt ſafe way in great complicated Tumours, where there is danger of a flux of Bloud, and much to be preferred before that Mountebank-way of Abſciſion with Ligature in every reſpect.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of above 60 years of age,<note place="margin">19. Obſervat. of a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour taken out of the left Breaſt by Inciſion.</note> of a corpulent full Body, had a round movable Tumour on his left Breaſt of the bigneſs of a Cheſnut. I divided the Skin by Inciſion, and, finding that Tubercle lying in its <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> I eaſily thruſt it out by paſſing a <hi>Spatula</hi> under it; then dreſſed up the Wound with a round Doſſill ſpred with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over it. The third day I dreſſed it again, leſſening the Doſſill. Thus the Wound digeſted, the Lips contracted and incarned, and healed in few days. In this <hi>Cyſtis</hi> was contained a Traſh not unlike Hair or Wooll. This perſon was ſubject to theſe preternaturall Tumours. He had one cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Waſt-band of his Breeches, which I afterwards cut out: it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame kind of Traſh.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I was attending a Perſon of Honour in the Country,<note place="margin">20. Obſervat. of a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <hi>in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine</hi> taken out by Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> I was deſired by an Apothecary in the neighbourhood to look upon an elderly Woman, who had a very large unequall ſoft Tumour in her right Groin. I concluded it complicated, and at their deſire opened it, and diſcharged about the quantity of a Pint of a brown traſhy Humour: whereupon the greateſt part of the Tumour was voided; but what remained of it lay as it had been a coverture to a cluſter of Damaſcens. I inlarged the Orifice, and found theſe ſo many Bladders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſeverall ſorts of Traſh in them, ſome whereof was melicerous. I pull'd them out, and tare a thick Membrane which had divided the Abſceſſe into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall partitions; then dreſſed it with Stupes of fine Tow ſpred with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> which I dipt in Praecipitate, and bound it up. The fourth day I dreſſed it again; and, ſeeing it digeſted, I dreſſed it with ſome of the ſame Mundificative dipt in <hi>mel roſar.</hi> and embrocated the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> By this method the Abſceſſe deterged, and the Tumour leſſened: by which time having done my buſineſs in that Noble Family, I left the Cure of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the Apothecary, who finiſhed it.</p>
                     <p>A Maid aged 24 years came to <hi>London</hi> diſeaſed with a large <hi>Struma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Struma</hi> eradicated by Cauſtick.</note> of an ovall figure, lying on the left ſide of her Neck deep amongſt the Muſcles and Tendons. After evacuation by Purging, deſigning the eradicating it by Cauſtick, I marked out the place with ink, drawing 2 lines down the length of it, about a finger's breadth from one another: then defending the outſides with Snips
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95669:145"/>of Plaiſters, I applied Pledgits ſpred with my cauſtick Unguent in the void ſpace, with <hi>emplaſtr. diachalciteos,</hi> Compreſs and Bandage. The next day I divided the Eſcar, and rubb'd into it with a Cauſtick-ſtone and Stick dipt <hi>in ol. vitrioli</hi> interchangeably, till I had penetrated deep into the body of the <hi>Struma.</hi> Then I cut through that Eſcar, and dreſſed it up with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> malaxed <hi>cum ol. terebinth.</hi> embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum oleo roſ. &amp; aceto.</hi> I then dreſſed it up with <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> The third day I took off Dreſſings, and fomented it with <hi>decoct. fol. althaeae, malvae, ſummitat. abrotoni, flor. ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buci, ſem. lini,</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed it with Lenients as before, to haſten the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Eſcar. After I ſaw the Eſcar digeſt, and ſomewhat ſeparated in the bottome, I rubb'd into the <hi>Struma</hi> again with the Cauſticks, penetrating deeper into each part of it, and dreſſed it up with Lenients, and ſo diſmiſſed her. About an hour after, the Eſcaroticks penetrating ſome Artery in the Gland, it bled through the Dreſſings very much, and continuing ſo to doe, ſhe was brought back to my houſe in a Coach: at which time I was in the next Street with Dr. <hi>Walter Needham,</hi> experimenting the Royall Stiptick-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We haſtned to this Patient, and ſeeing her bleed, we took off the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and applying Doſſills dipt in the Stiptick, immediately ſtopt it. I dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients, and a Reſtrictive over it. The fourth day after I took off Dreſſings, and applied Lenients again. After the ſeparation of the Eſcar, ſeeing the body of the <hi>Struma</hi> conſumed, the ſides onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I fill'd with Praecipitate, and kept the Orifice dilated till they were totally waſted; then permitted the Ulcer to incarn, and afterwards brought the Lips of the Ulcer cloſe together, and cicatrized them with <hi>unguent. deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativ. rub.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman aged 30 years, of a tolerable good Habit of body,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of the like.</note> had been long diſeaſed with a hard <hi>Struma,</hi> of an ovall figure, ſeated under the lower Jaw on the right ſide. After he had vainly endeavoured by various Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reſolve it, he put himſelf into the hands of Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> and my ſelf. We propoſed to eradicate it by Eſcaroticks: to which purpoſe his Body being prepared by Purging, we began our Chirurgery with the application of a Cauſtick the length of the <hi>Struma,</hi> and the next day divided the Eſcar, fomenting the Tumour with a Decoction of <hi>abſinth. flor. cham. roſ. rub. ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauſt.</hi> &amp;c. then fill'd up the divided Eſcar with <hi>pulv. ſine pari</hi> of Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſer</hi>'s preſcription, applying Pledgits of <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. roſ.</hi> over it. The ſecond day after I fomented and dreſſed it up again with Lenients and continued that method till the Eſcar made by the Eſcarotick began to ſeparate: then I thruſt it off, and fill'd it again with <hi>pulv. ſine pari.</hi> By this way of dreſſing, ſometimes with Eſcaroticks, and othertimes with Digeſtives, we conſumed the main body of the <hi>Struma,</hi> and afterwards digeſted out the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> then permitted it to incarn by leſſening the number of the Doſſills, and at laſt cicatrized it with a ſmall Seam by the help of the Vitriol-ſtone and common Epuloticks.</p>
                     <p>A Man aged 20 years, of a Phlegmatick Conſtitution,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of the like.</note> came to me with a large <hi>Struma,</hi> of an ovall figure, lying under the lower right Jaw. There were alſo ſome little ones lying higher up nearer that Ear. The bigger of theſe had not appeared worth taking notice of till within ſix weeks of the time that he came to me. I began with the application of <hi>valentia digitalis,</hi> and purged him frequently with <hi>pulv. diaturbith, pil. cochiae min. calomel.</hi> &amp;c. The Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour increaſing, I applied more powerfull Reſolvents, as <hi>emplaſtr. diachyl. ireatum cum gummi,</hi> &amp;c. by which, after ſome time, it tended to maturation; and then I proceeded that way, purpoſing not to open it till the whole <hi>Struma</hi> ſhould be ſuppurated. But he, impatient of the delay, ſhewed it to ſome
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95669:146"/>other, who opened it whilſt the Suppuration was ſuperficiall; ſo that preſently after the diſcharge of the Matter it hardned again, and grew difficult of Cure. The Patient returning to my hands, I took off the Dreſſings, and ſeeing the Tumour large and hard, the Orifice ſmall, and a Tent in it, I pull'd it out, and filling the Orifice with Lint, applied a large Cauſtick according to the length of the Gland. The next day I divided the Eſcar, and fill'd the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed part with <hi>turbith mineral.</hi> and applying Pledgits of <hi>baſilicon</hi> over the Eſcar, dreſſed it up with <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> After the ſeparation of the Sloughs, I dreſſed it every other day with <hi>Merc. praecipitat. Vigon.</hi> repeated Purgatives, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae &amp; lign. guaiaci,</hi> with Antiſtrumatick Plants, for to drink thrice a day, alſo <hi>ceruſſa antimonii,</hi> and ſome of the teſtaceous Powders, to be taken as often. During the application of Praecipitate and the milder Eſcaroticks, I made but ſmall progreſs: wherefore to haſten the extirpation of it, I applied a <hi>troch. de minio</hi> the whole length, with Doſſills ſpred with Lenients over it. At the next day's dreſſing I found the <hi>troch. de minio</hi> had made a great penetration into the Gland, but with exceſſive pain, inflammation and tumefaction of the Parts. I fomented it with Milk, dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients, and applied an anodyne Cataplaſm <hi>ex fol. malvae, biſmalvae, panis triticei,</hi> &amp;c. by which the Tumour relaxed, but thoſe <hi>Strumae</hi> near the Ear appeared bigger; which foreſhewed the danger of proceeding farther with Eſcaroticks of Sublimate. I embrocated them with <hi>valentia ſcrophulariae,</hi> and haſtened the diſcuſſing and drying up of the inflowed Humour by a Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>ſummitat. abſinth. majoran. flor. roſ. rub. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. During the ſeparation of the Eſcar there appeared daily an increaſe of a well-digeſted Matter, and after the Eſcar caſt off, the Matter iſſued out above and below under the Gland. The way to remove theſe <hi>Sinus's</hi> was to extirpate the <hi>Struma;</hi> which I preſently did, by rubbing it with the Cauſtick-ſtone and Oil of Vitriol interchangeably. After I had removed it, and wiped off the looſe Sloughs, I dreſſed the Eſcar with a mixture of <hi>unguent. baſilic. &amp; ol. lilior.</hi> hot, and kept the Lips of the Ulcer dilated with Doſſills, then embrocated the Parts about, applying over all <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> After the ſeparation of this laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcar, there appeared part of the <hi>Struma</hi> lying on one ſide, which I afterwards waſted by the application of Praecipitate and the Vitriol-ſtone, then leſſened the number of my Doſſills, and permitted the Ulcer to heal up; during which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Purging, and adviſed Embrocation of the leſſer Glands. He was haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Country: but of late years I have ſeen him very well, and thoſe leſſer <hi>Strumae</hi> waſted.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of the like.</note> Scrophulous and full of fancy, came out of the Country with a large <hi>Struma</hi> on the right ſide of her Neck, lying under that <hi>Maxilla,</hi> not unlike that in the former Obſervation. It had been attempted in the Country ſuperficially, and healed up again, with the Skin adhering to it. She had conſulted ſeverall of my Profeſſion in the City, and was curious in the informing her ſelf how I would proceed in the taking it out. I offered to her the ſeverall ways propoſed in the method of Cure, but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the way by Inciſion. She objected againſt that way, having (it ſeems) been told that it might prejudice that Eye. I, ſuppoſing ſhe urged it out of fear of having it cut, did not farther inſiſt upon it: for indeed the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall of cutting generally frights people from us. Some time after ſhe took a Lodging near me. I began the work by the application of a Cauſtick the full length of the <hi>Struma,</hi> divided the Eſcar, and fill'd it up with <hi>Merc. praecipitat. Vigon.</hi> then embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over all, repeating this way of dreſſing every third day, and fomenting it with <hi>decoct. abſinth.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95669:146"/>flor. roſ. rub. balauſt. baccar. myrtill. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> After the Eſcar ſeparated in the middle, I thruſt in a <hi>troch. de minio,</hi> and dreſſed it up as aforeſaid. The next day ſhe complained of her ill night's reſt, and ſhewed me the Tumour and Parts about inflamed and ſwelled. I fomented them with Milk, dreſſed them up with Lenients, and let her bloud in the Arm. The next day I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, rhab.</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards with a cathartick Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeme. Which method ought to have preceded, if ſhe would have admitted it. As the Sloughs caſt off, I ſtrewed in Praecipitate, and touched it ſometimes with a Vitriol-ſtone. Having thus penetrated under part of the <hi>Struma,</hi> I raiſed that part up, and thruſt it out in pieces with a round-pointed Knife fitted to that purpoſe, then dreſſed up the remaining <hi>Struma</hi> with the milder Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roticks. From the time I applied that <hi>troch. de minio,</hi> ſhe complained that her right Eye was leſs then the other, and was ſo poſſeſſed with the thoughts of it, that I was glad to refer it to the judgement of what Phyſicians ſhe pleaſed. Whereupon Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox,</hi> Dr. <hi>Staynes</hi> and Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> were conſulted. By this her Surmiſe I had the honour to have my work approved by ſo many knowing perſons, and ſhe was the more encouraged to admit of my proceeding. The Cure was effected afterwards in the ſpace of 3 weeks to her ſatisfaction: yet ſhe would not be diſſwaded but that Eye was leſs then the other. About a year after I ſaw her again in the Town, and felt a ſmall Gland of the bigneſs of a Lupin lying lower on that ſide of her Neck. I would have perſwaded her to admit of a reſolvent Emplaſter, and to be touched: but ſhe did not (as ſhe ſaid) believe it to be the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A perſon of about 19 years of age had many <hi>Strumae</hi> on both ſides of her Neck, one eſpecially very large on the left ſide,<note place="margin">5.

The Eſcar being made as we deſigned, I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, and began to raiſe it off, with intention to take out the <hi>Struma:</hi> but ſhe growing impatient of the ſmart, I rubb'd deep into the body of it with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and fill'd that Eſcar with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> applying Pledgits of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> over it; then embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> dreſt it up with <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> Compreſs and Bandage.

The other <hi>Struma,</hi> which had been big, ſeemed alſo wel-nigh reſolved: yet upon the cicatrizing that Ulcer ſhe was ſeized with an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> on her Head and Face, which ſwelled them extraordinarily; but by purging the Phyſician removed that.</p>

Obſervat. of a <hi>Struma</hi> extirpated by Cauſtick.</note> having been long diſeaſed with a <hi>Struma</hi> on the left ſide of her Neck, reaching from her Ear down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Jaw, and frequently ſubject to Catarrhs, and ſometime Coughing of bloud; I began the extirpation of it by the application of a Cauſtick the whole length of the Gland. In dividing the Eſcar there diſcharged a ſmall quantity of an albuginous Matter. After the ſeparation of the Eſcar, a Cheeſie ſubſtance came away, and the Gland lay hard underneath. I fill'd the Abſceſs with Praecipitate, and kept the Lips dilated with Doſſills, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating this method of dreſſing her every third day: during which Dr. <hi>Mic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klethwait</hi> was conſulted, and preſcribed Internalls accordingly as he ſaw her obſtructed. He met with many difficulties in the removing thoſe various Diſtempers ariſing from the acid quality in her Bloud, it diſſolving her Fleſh, and threatning a <hi>Maraſmus.</hi> By the continued uſe of the Praecipitate the ſtrumous Fleſh ſeemed to me conſumed, and the Ulcer well diſpoſed for incarning: when one day in dreſſing her I beheld a ſmall white Bleb of fleſh in the middle of the Ulcer, and preſſing upon it with my Probe, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deep into it. I pull'd out the Probe again, and bending it paſſed it into the ſaid <hi>Sinus,</hi> and thereby diſcovered it hollow both above and below: by which it appeared I had incarned upon a falſe foundation. I paſſed a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor into the ſaid <hi>Sinus,</hi> and laid it large open the whole length. The work was neither painfull nor bloudy. I fill'd up the <hi>Sinus</hi> with Doſſills, rubb'd the ſpongy Lips with the Vitriol-ſtone, and covered the Ulcer with Praecipitate, keeping the externall Lips dilated as at firſt I had done. By the repeating this method the ſtrumous Fleſh was conſumed, and the Ulcer ſmoothly cicatrized. But about a month after there appeared a Swelling in the ſame Part, to the great diſturbance of my Patient: but it was onely a Flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which I ſoon diſcuſſed by the application of Diſcutients. From that time ſhe hath been free of that Malady.

                        </note> of a tolerable good Habit of body, came to me with a ſtrumous Tumour a little above the right <hi>Scapula.</hi> It had been of a long continuance, and ſome years before it had ſuppurated, and was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome neighbouring Chirurgeon: but he not throughly eradicating it, it grew again, and was very large, the Skin adhering to the upper part of it. I applied a ſtrong Cauſtick on it; which having penetrated deep into it, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Eſcar, and applied <hi>troch. de minio</hi> to it, then dreſſed it up with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients. After the ſeparation of this latter Eſcar, I rubb'd it with a Cauſtick-ſtone under the edges of the firſt Eſcar, and into the <hi>baſis</hi> of it, and interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably preſt into the body of the Gland with <hi>ol. vitrioli;</hi> then wiping away the looſe Sloughs and bloud, I fill'd it up with <hi>Merc. praecipitat. Vigonis,</hi> and dreſſed it with Lenients. After the ſeparation of theſe Sloughs, I thruſt out pieces of the ſtrumous Fleſh with the end of a <hi>Spatula</hi> ſomewhat bended and ſharpened to that purpoſe. Thus I extirpated this great body of the Gland,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95669:147"/>and by the uſe of the Vitriol-ſtone and Praecipitate I deterged and cicatrized it ſmooth; and ſo it remaineth to this day.</p>
                     <p>A Maid aged about 18 years came recommended to me out of the Country with a cluſter of <hi>Strumae</hi> lying behind her left Ear,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of <hi>Strumae.</hi> and <hi>Sarcoma</hi> extirpated by Cauſtick.</note> along the <hi>Muſculus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoïdes,</hi> down to the Clavicle. She had alſo a <hi>Sarcoma</hi> on the inſide of her left Ancle. Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> preſcribed her a Courſe of Phyſick, by which her Body being prepared, I began with the extirpation of the <hi>Strumae</hi> by the application of a Cauſtick from the uppermoſt part near the Ear downward, making the Eſcar about half an inch broad, then dividing it fill'd the Ulcer with <hi>pulv. ſine pari</hi> of Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> and applied Lenients over the Eſcar with <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> The next day I ſtuped the Tumour with <hi>decoct. malvae, violar.</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed it up with Lenients, continuing that way of dreſſing till the Slough which was made by the <hi>pulv. ſine pari</hi> ſeparated: then drawing the Lips wider open, and finding that I had penetrated into the body of the <hi>Strumae,</hi> and that ſome of them lay looſe, I paſſed in my bended <hi>Spatula,</hi> and thruſt part of the Cluſter out, ſome in pieces, others whole in their <hi>Cyſtis.</hi> That done, I wiped away the bloud, and fill'd the Cavity with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> applying Doſſills of Lint and Lenients over all. By this method of dreſſing I extirpated the <hi>Strumae,</hi> and diſpoſed the Ulcer to cure. During this I began with the Tumour on the Ancle, and having applied a large Cauſtick upon it, I made an Inciſion into it, and diſcharged a bloudy <hi>Serum</hi> in ſome quantity: yet the Tumour did not ſink. I fill'd up the Inciſion with <hi>troch. de minio,</hi> and dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients, <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> and Bandage. The fourth day after I took off Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and, finding all well, repeated the application of Lenients, to haſten ſeparation of the Eſcar; which in few days caſt off, and the fleſhy body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appeared to be a <hi>Sarcoma.</hi> I fill'd it with Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> his <hi>pulv. ſine pari,</hi> and dreſſed it again as before with Lenients, Compreſſe, and good Bandage. Theſe fleſhy Tumours were not of ſo acute ſenſe as the moſt ſorts of <hi>Strumae</hi> are, but more difficult to extirpate, by reaſon of the many Veins and Arteries which brancht through the body thereof, and render'd it apt to bleed, and increaſe faſter then I could take it down by Eſcarotick powders. Upon which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I propoſed the actuall Cautery: but that not being admitted, I made up ſome Trochisks <hi>de minio</hi> with a double quantity of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> in the form of Tents; and as the Eſcars ſeparated in any part thereof, I thruſt in a Trochisk, which always cauſed the bloud to burſt forth: but by the application of the <hi>pulv. ſine pari</hi> with Doſſills dipt <hi>in albumine ovi,</hi> with good Compreſſe and Bandage, I ſtopped it. By this method I made way deep into the body of it: yet between the Trochisks and in the circumference it did riſe upon me; which put me upon a neceſſity of uſing the Cauſtick-ſtone and <hi>ol. vitriol.</hi> The uſe of theſe ſeverall Eſcaroticks cauſed excoriation in the neighbouring Parts, which obliged me to dreſs them the oftner with Refrigerants, <hi>unguent. alb. camphorat.</hi> &amp;c. Having thus extirpated the <hi>Sarcoma</hi> near its <hi>baſis,</hi> I left off the uſe of the Trochisks, and for ſome days applied <hi>pulv. ſine pari Jo. Ardern.</hi> it being more powerfully drying, and leſs corroſive; then applied a <hi>Malagma</hi> of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in the form of a Cake round over it, with Compreſſe, and laced on a ſtreight Sock, to keep all faſt. After I had thus waſted the <hi>Sarcoma,</hi> I dreſſed it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat. unguent. tutiae Vigonis,</hi> &amp;c. and by the help of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol-ſtone, <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> and the like, I ſmoothed and cicatrized the Ulcer. That of her Neck curing ſome weeks ſooner.</p>
                     <p>One about 11 years of age, of a ſickly Conſtitution,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of <hi>Struma</hi> with a <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</note> was brought by her Friends to Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> He conſulted me in the extirpating a Strumous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour upon the <hi>Aſpera arteria.</hi> It was compoſed of many ſeverall Glands, in the middle whereof one lay much more protuberant, of the bigneſs of a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95669:148"/>It was to my judgment Atheromatous, but ſomewhat more tenſe; and I thought I felt Pulſation in it, but ſo ſmall, that I doubted whether it were not rather in my fingers: however, I deſired a Chirurgeon might be conſulted; who accordingly was fetched, and concluded it an <hi>Atheroma.</hi> We agreed in the opening it by Cauſtick, and by eradicating that to make way for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. After the application of the Cauſtick we met again, and ſeeing the Eſcar almoſt large enough to take out the Tumour whole in its <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> we divided it, and began with our Knives to ſeparate it: but the Child feeling it ſmart, and the bloud trickle down, it hinder'd our farther proceeding that way, ſo that we onely cut off the looſe Eſcars, and dreſſed it up with Lenients. The third day Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> met us there as we were taking off Dreſſings. The <hi>Cyſtis</hi> appeared to me the thickeſt and ſtrongeſt I had ever ſeen. I could not think it was made to contain an Atheromatous Matter. I felt it again, and was contented to believe the Pulſation I there felt might be in my fingers ends; however I reſolved to proceed warily; and to that purpoſe made a Puncture into it with a <hi>French</hi> Lancet, upon which a florid bloud trickled forth. The Apertion being ſmall, it ſtopt by the application of <hi>pulv. Galeni cum album. ovi,</hi> and we left her. The next day the Chirurgeon and my ſelf met, and, conſidering the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> being diſroabed of her naturall Tegument, the Skin was not like to be re-inveſted with it again, we propoſed to proceed timely in the preventing an effuſion of bloud. The way we deſigned was by Eſcaroticks, <hi>viz. pulv. ſine pari.</hi> The next day we took off Dreſſings, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> with the foreſaid Powder, applying Reſtrictives over all the Part, it being incapable of ſtrict Bandage. Againſt the next eruption we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all things ready, both actuall and potentiall Cauteries; yet with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration not to dreſs her till we were neceſſitated. The ſecond morning after we were both called early out of our beds by a meſſenger, telling us ſhe had bled the moſt part of the night. We diſpatched our Servants away to prepare Dreſſings, and haſtened after, and taking her out of her Bed placed her in a Chair. I ſtood behind her to hold her ſteady, and had one Servant near me with a Diſh wherein were ſeverall Eſcaroticks, ſome ſtronger then other, alſo of different ſizes and ſhapes. My brother Chirurgeon had his Servant near him attending the actuall Cauteries in the fire. In taking off the Dreſſings, the bloud burſt forth with ſuch a guſh as gave no leiſure to call for an actuall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, nor was there poſſibility of uſing it with any advantage. I preſently thruſt in a piece of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> and preſt a <hi>Paſtillus</hi> of <hi>Celſus</hi> cloſe upon it, and held it ſo with my hands; which ſtopt the bleeding in a moment. I held my hands on it till we judged the Eſcarotick had ſecured the bleeding: then they cleanſed the Parts about with a Sponge, and refreſht the Patient with a draught of a cordiall Julep: after which the Reſtrictives were applied one over another over her Throat, up both ſides of her Neck. I kept my hands upon them till they were dried faſt on. Then we put her on a Crevat, and laid her again in bed. It did not bleed; but ſhe complaining daily of pain more and more, we agreed to dreſs her the fourth day. I attended then with our Servants, preparing our Dreſſings, to ſtop the bloud and heal the Excoriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. My Copartner not coming, I took off Dreſſings, with deſign onely to dreſs the Excoriations: but they came all off together, bringing with them a very thick Eſcar. While I was looking upon the <hi>Fungus,</hi> I ſaw the bloud riſe out of it in many places, as if it had been pricked with a Lancet. Thoſe drops immediately inlarged their way, and bled forcibly in ſo many Streams. At firſt ſight of it I applied a piece of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> The bloud burſt forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my fingers a while; but upon the applying a proportionable Paſtill over the Sublimate the bleeding ſtopt. Whilſt I continued my hands upon it, my
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:95669:148"/>Servant wiped away the bloud, and dreſſed the Excoriations with <hi>unguent. alb. camph.</hi> &amp;c. and applied the Reſtrictives over all as before: which being dried on, a Crevat was put on, and ſhe placed again in her Bed. From this Dreſſing I grew confident of ſucceſs, the former Eſcar appearing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily thick and large, as well it might, conſidering the Cauſtick, (which was ſuch as I would not adviſe to uſe in any caſe where there may be the leaſt hopes to ſave their lives without it.) Where the Opening is ſmall, a Finger may ſtop the bleeding of an Arterie: but in a <hi>Fungus</hi> ſo branched, in a place ſo incapable of Bandage, what could have reſiſted ſuch a guſhing forth of bloud but <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> whoſe force is far more penetrating in ſuch <hi>Fungi</hi> then a hot Iron? eſpecially conſidering how the bloud would have dulled it by the way. The uſe of the Sublimate this ſecond time cauſed a Fainting and Palpitation of her heart: in which caſe Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> came again, and aſſiſted us by his Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet it terminated in a <hi>Ptyeliſmus.</hi> The fourth day after this we met all together, and took off her Dreſſings, whereupon was ſeparated a thick white Eſcar; the remaining body appearing like a glandulous Fleſh, ſomewhat hard, and of the bigneſs of a ſmall Cheſnut. It bleeding no more, we dreſſed it with ſome of the milder Eſcaroticks, and the Excoriations with refrigerant Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, with Emplaſters of <hi>diachalcit.</hi> &amp;c. we waſted that <hi>Fungus,</hi> and alſo healed the Excoriations in the ſpace of 3 weeks. There was a fair opportunity of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the remaining Glands: but the Relations ſuſpecting perhaps that new miſchiefs might happen from ſome branches of the ſame Arterie, we cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Ulcer, and left the extirpation of the other to farther conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>A Maid aged about 30 years, of a tolerable ſtrong Conſtitution,<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of <hi>Broncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele.</hi>
                        </note> came to me with a complicated Tumour lying on the left ſide of her Neck, from her Ear to the <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> and ſo ſtretching over it upward to the other ſide of the Neck. It was ſoft, and ſeemed to be full of Matter, but without Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I made a Puncture into the body of it, and diſcharged a ſtinking <hi>Serum</hi> not unlike Horſe-piſs. That being let out, the Tumour ſunk, and felt unequally hard. I dreſſed it up with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilicon</hi> and <hi>empl. diachalcit.</hi> The next day, taking off Dreſſings, and ſeeing the Swelling lank, I applied a Cauſtick the length of two inches, about 3 fingers breadth diſtant from the Ear: the Eſcar I divided, and diſcharged a foul Matter, and afterwards dreſſed it up with Doſſills dipt in <hi>Merc. praecip.</hi> with Lenients over the Eſcar; and from that time haſtened the falling off of the Slough. After the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, I thruſt out a different ſort of Matter, not unlike that of an <hi>Atheroma</hi> and <hi>Meliceris</hi> mixt together. I paſſed in my Probe-ſciſſors, and laid it open downward to the <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> and pull'd out with my fingers ſeverall <hi>Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae,</hi> ſome containing a foul <hi>Serum,</hi> others a gritty ſubſtance. There alſo came away gobbets of Fleſh, with which the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Abſceſſe ſeemed to be covered. Having thus cleanſed it, I fill'd it up with Doſſills dipt in Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, and kept the Lips dilated; repeating this method of dreſſing every other day, and rubbing the ſtrumous Excreſcences with the Vitriol-ſtone. The <hi>Sinus</hi> contracted narrower within; but the originall of this Tumour being Strumous, it would not heal whilſt there remained any hollowneſs, but fill'd with that ſort of Fleſh, and raiſed a Tumour. Upon ſight whereof I applied a Cauſtick upon the upper part towards the Ear, and divided it with a pair of Sciſſors, then fill'd the <hi>Sinus</hi> with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> dreſſing the Lips of the Ulcer with Digeſtives. After the Eſcar ſeparated, I applied my endeavours to eradicate the ſtrumous Fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone and Praecipitate, and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it from the Ear downwards; yet not without ſome difficulty, the <hi>baſis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving falſe more then once in one part or other. Some of this ſtrumous Fleſh
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95669:149"/>riſing amongſt the Veſſells, and uniting over them, made <hi>Sinus's</hi> ſo deep, that I much doubted how to divide thoſe without danger of theſe Veſſells: but there being no Cure to be expected whilſt this remained, I paſſed a Ligature with a ſmall Probe under the <hi>Fungus,</hi> and by Deligation of it, and application of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, I conſumed the <hi>Fungus,</hi> and laid the deepeſt of them open; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the application of Epuloticks brought a <hi>Cicatrix</hi> upon them. Having thus well-near healed the Abſceſſe to the <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> I laid the other ſide open, and eradicated that part by the ſame method as the former, and cicatrized it ſmooth.</p>
                     <p>One of about 14 years of age came out of the Country recommended to Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> with a complicated Tumour of a great bulk on the left ſide of her Neck and Cheek,<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of <hi>Broncho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cele.</hi>
                        </note> ariſing under her Ear. It had been growing many years, and was without Inflammation. Her Body being prepared by a purging Apozeme, and Antiſtrumaticks preſcribed by her Phyſician, he commended the extirpation of it to my care. Accordingly I met him at her Chamber. We deſigned the taking it out by Inciſion; and to that purpoſe, having all things ready, I made Inciſion into it. But the bloud trickling faſt down, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare the Operation that time, and dreſſed it up with Aſtringents. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day after we met again, and in taking off the Dreſſings ſaw it had not bled, nor was there any Pulſation to be felt in it whereby we might ſuſpect any conſiderable flux of bloud. What did flow proceeded, as we ſuppoſed, from ſome ſmall <hi>Fungus.</hi> Upon which conſideration we reſolved to eradicate this preternaturall Tumour by Eſcaroticks; and began with the application of a ſtrong Cauſtick on the middle of it, according to the length of the Tumour. The next day we divided the Eſcar, and filling it full of his <hi>pulv. ſine pari,</hi> I embrocated the Parts about, and dreſſed the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> &amp;c. By the application of this Powder we penetrated into the body of the Tumour: and after ſeparation of the Sloughs, ſeeing no danger of its bleeding, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the uſe of the <hi>pulv. ſine pari:</hi> and having thereby diſcovered the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to conſiſt of many ſeverall Species, <hi>viz. Strumae, Atheroma, Meliceris,</hi> and <hi>Steatoma,</hi> we laid it more open by Inciſion, and with a crooked <hi>Spatula</hi> and our fingers pull'd out ſome of them in pieces, others whole in a Cluſter, then fill'd it again with the ſaid Powder, and dreſſed the divided Lips with Doſſills ſpred with Digeſtives. By this method we eradicated this great body: but in our approaching near that part of her Cheek which had bagg'd ſo long time between her Jaws, we found it penetrated, and the Liquour ſhe took in her mouth diffuſing it ſelf into the Abſceſſe, alſo the Matter made in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe diſcharging it ſelf into the Mouth. Whether this Opening was made by the Teeth, or fretted by the acrimony of the Humour within, I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but it contributed much to the forwarding of the Cure there: for by Injections deterſive and drying we cleared that part of the Ulcer, and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it with the externall part of the Cheek ſo cloſe, that her Jaws were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chew her meat, which they had not been in a long time before. The laſt difficulty was, in eradicating that part which lay in a manner round un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the root of the Ear, threatning the very Organ. We laid it open, and by the milder Eſcaroticks at length eradicated the <hi>Strumae</hi> there without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Organ, cicatrizing it ſmooth the whole length of the Ulcer, by bringing the Lips together within a narrow <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> to the ſatisfaction of her Relations. During the application of ſome of theſe Eſcaroticks, ſhe was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a <hi>Palpitatio cordis,</hi> and did ſomewhat ſalivate; but was therein relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sr. <hi>Alex.

                     <p>A Lady brought her onely Son to Town, who was about 7 years of age,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of Ulcers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chaps.</note> of a ſickly weak Conſtitution, obſtructed internally with the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> in his Meſentery and Lungs. He had externally many <hi>Strumae</hi> under his Jaws, from his left Ear down to his right Jaw. Some of them were bigger then others, and ulcerated: one whereof had made its own way out, was grown callous, and lay protuberant in the form of an over-grown Excreſcence. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the aſſiſtence of a Phyſician: but the Mother would not, yet promiſed, if there were a neceſſity, ſhe would at any time conſult one. I began his Courſe of Phyſick with a Solution of <hi>ſyr. de rhab.</hi> in a Tincture of Sena, and preſcribed him a medicated Ale of <hi>ſarſa, lign. lentiſc. Chinae, raſ. eboris, rad. ruſci, ſcrophul.</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>millepedes.</hi> I dreſſed the ulcerated Glands with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and Praecipitate: and after Deterſion with <hi>unguent. diapom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phol.</hi> to the other Glands, which were hard and intire, I applied <hi>empl. diachyl. ireat.</hi> as it is ſet down in the method of Cure. During which application, I purged him again, and with a few grains of <hi>diagrid.</hi> and <hi>Merc. dulc.</hi> vomited him once: it worked churliſhly with him. That night I ſent him ſome of the anodyne Syrup to take in a draught of Mace-ale; which quieted the Ferment raiſed by the Phyſick. From that time I purged him with Infuſion of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb in his medicated Ale once a week, giving him 7 or 8 grains of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel.</hi> the night before he drank his Rhubarb: the intermitting days he took one of the teſtaceous Powders preſcribed in the method of Cure. The callous <hi>Struma</hi> I rubb'd down with the Cauſtick-ſtone, and after ſeparation of the Eſcar I deterged with the Vitriol-ſtone, and ſometime <hi>Merc. praecipitat. rubr.</hi> The ulcerated <hi>Strumae</hi> digeſted well, and as the Glands waſted, the Ulcers cured. To the other Glands not ulcerated I applied a <hi>Malagma</hi> of <hi>Corn. Celſus,</hi> by which they viſibly reſolved. Whilſt I proceeded in this method, Dr. <hi>Micklethwait</hi> was conſulted by the Mother, he being her Phyſician. He ſaw the Patient in this thriving condition, and, I think, preſcribed him onely a cordiall Julep. The Winter approaching, I ſupplied the Patient with Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and internall Remedies, ſhewing his Maid how to apply them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected her how to regulate the Patient. The Cure of theſe Diſeaſes is the work of time: for till the internall <hi>Viſcera</hi> be freed of the <hi>Strumae</hi> which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they are ſtuft with, the externall Cure of them ſignifieth little. They returned into the Countrey, and the Child enjoyed a good meaſure of health till about <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and then the Matter fermented again internally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, that Air diſagreeing with him: upon which account they returned back to <hi>London</hi> early in the Spring, and ſent for me again, and, I think, for Dr. <hi>Micklethwait.</hi> The Child was put into much the ſame Courſe of Phyſick as before. I alſo digeſted the Ulcers, and proceeded as I had done the laſt year: the Child accordingly recovered, and enjoyed a good health. His Maid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown skilfull in dreſſing him, I viſited him the ſeldomer, yet ſent my Servant oftner: for, as I have ſaid, his Cure did not conſiſt in the healing theſe <hi>Strumae;</hi> yet they were in a good condition, and not at all painfull, unleſs it were ſometime when I uſed the Vitriol-ſtone and Praecipitate together, which was ſeldome. He being well recovered, returned into the Country towards Autumn, and came up the Spring following indiſpoſed with a Catarrh and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95669:150"/>other Diſeaſes in his Bowells; but ſoon recovered here, whereas the Northern Air was too ſharp for his tender Body. During the time I attended him, he was as much grown and improved in his health as ever I ſaw any, and the <hi>Strumae</hi> that were remaining were few, and much diminiſhed: the <hi>Malagma</hi> of <hi>Celſus</hi> put them upon a Suppuration whenſoever it was applied; and I always permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Matter to make its own way out by ſmall Eruptions: during which I ordered them to be dreſſed with Lenients, <hi>viz. unguent. diapompholyg. tutiae,</hi> or ſuch like, till the Matter was diſcharged; after which I applied the <hi>Malag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> again, to put the remainder upon Suppuration. This way I ſhewed his Maid, and by theſe interchangeable Applications they did reſolve. The Mother did not this laſt time conſult Dr. <hi>Micklethwait</hi> nor my ſelf in Phyſick, but imployed ſome other ſecretly. Upon notice thereof I viſited them leſs, and told the Mother, that where I did not preſcribe the Phyſick, or was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Phyſician, I did not deſire to be the Chirurgeon, the Cure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending moſt upon the internall Preſcriptions. Some weeks after, viſiting the Patient, I ſaw one of the <hi>Strumae</hi> thruſting out of the Skin in a <hi>Fungus.</hi> I would have thruſt it more out, tied a Thread under it, and have ſnipt it off with a pair of Sciſſors: but he crying, I dreſſed it up with Praecipitate. At my next viſit I met a Chirurgeon there, and preſented the caſe of the Patient to him, with my way of proceeding. He ſaw me dreſs the Ulcers: they were but few and ſmall. He declared the way had been rationall, and that ſuch Diſeaſes did require time to perfect them.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of Ulcers in the Neck, and an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roma</hi> in the Arm.</note> aged about ten years, was diſeaſed with many <hi>Strumae:</hi> ſome whereof lay under his Jaws and the ſide of his Neck, ſtretching down from the one Ear to the other; ſome of them lay intire in their <hi>Cyſtis;</hi> others were ulcerated, and paſſed their Matter into one another: they were ſordid in ſome parts, and overgrown with looſe Fleſh in others. He had alſo an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roma</hi> on the outſide of one of his Arms about three inches in length, reaching to the Elbow-joint. Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſer</hi> was his Phyſician, and put him into my hands. He purged him with an Infuſion of Sena, Rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> &amp;c. with Antiſtrumaticks. I began with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a Cauſtick on the <hi>Atheroma,</hi> laying it open the whole length, and gave vent to an albuginous and cheeſy Matter; then dreſſed it with Lenients, to haſten ſeparation of the Eſcar. I alſo laid open the Sinuous Ulcers in his Neck, ſome by Cauſtick, others by Probe-ſciſſors. Thoſe Ulcers which were ſordid I dreſſed with <hi>Mercur. praecipitat.</hi> rubb'd the luxurious Fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, and kept the inciſed Lips dilated with Doſſills ſpred with Digeſtives. Whilſt I deterged thoſe ſeverall Ulcers, I endeavoured reſolution of the leſſer <hi>Strumae</hi> by the application of ſome of the Diſcutients propoſed in the method of Cure. During theſe proceedings in Chirurgery, Purgations were repeated, with the addition of <hi>Calomel.</hi> and on the intermitting days <hi>ceruſſa antimonii,</hi> &amp;c. were preſcribed; and thereby the Ulcers were diſpoſed to a healing condition. The <hi>Atheroma</hi> on his Arm I endeavoured to digeſt with various Medicaments: but whilſt any part of it lay hollow, it would neither digeſt nor deterge: but after I removed its Coverture, it digeſted and incarned with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> and cicatrized as the other did by the common Epuloticks.</p>
                     <p>A perſon about 28 years old,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of Ulcers on the Neck.</note> having been long diſeaſed with the <hi>Kings-Evill</hi> in many Glands on both ſides of her Neck, frequently apoſtemating with great tumefaction and pain, came to <hi>London,</hi> and conſulted me. Thoſe on the left ſide were then ſwelled from the Nuke down that ſide of the Neck and Cheek to the other ſide of the <hi>Trachea arteria.</hi> Whilſt ſhe was in the Country, that Gland near the Nuke apoſtemated, and was opened by a Chirurgeon there: but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95669:150"/>from that time it grew corroſive, and paſſed its Matter downward into the body of the Tumour amongſt the reſt of the Glands, and could not empty it ſelf but as it overflowed. Upon which account I propoſed the making an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the declining part of the Tumour: but ſhe, having been extreamly over-watched and tired with pain, took deliberation, and after a day or two ſent to me to meet at a Conſultation with one who pretends great matters in Chirurgery. I accordingly went: but he had been there before me, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtome, boldly undertook the Cure, promiſing to reſolve it in ten days by the application of an incombuſtible Sulphur. I did not believe it poſſible to cure her without giving vent to the Matter below, but left the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient at liberty to proceed with him, or any other. He began the next day with the anointing it with <hi>balſ. ſulphur. Rulandii,</hi> and every day daubed more of his ſaid Balſam upon the Swelling, till the ten days were paſſed. During which applications, the Matter being thereby choaked in, her pain increaſing more and more, and ſhe being no longer able to endure thoſe applications, ſhe ſent for Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſer,</hi> Sr. <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and my ſelf. We ſaw the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour exceedingly increaſed, and cruſted hard over with the Balſam. I fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it with Milk, and embrocated it with freſh Butter: but it not yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby, I applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex fol. malvar. violar. ſem. lini, pane tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. axung. porcina,</hi> &amp;c. The next morning we met again, took off the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm, freed the Tumour of its cruſted Coverture, and ſaw the ſame hard, dry, and much inflamed. We added to the former Cataplaſm <hi>mucilag. rad. althaeae &amp; lilior.</hi> and applied it, thereby ſuppurating it; then opened it by Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick in the declining part near the <hi>Trachea arteria,</hi> diſcharged a large quantity of digeſted Matter, and dreſſed it with Lenients. Whilſt the Matter plentifully emptied it ſelf there, the Inflammation and Tumour daily diminiſhed, and the Ulcer above, which had been daubed cloſe up with the <hi>balſ. ſulphuris,</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red well inclined to heal, and cicatrized ſoon after by the applying of <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi> The accidents of Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus removed, the Phyſicians were again conſulted; and hearing her ſtill complain of a <hi>Vertigo</hi> and great pain in her Head, as likewiſe of an Inflammation of her Eyes, they preſcribed her a purging Apozeme of <hi>ſena, polypod. hermodact. turbith</hi> decocted with <hi>ſarſa, lign. guaiaci, ſantal.</hi> &amp;c. She was alſo purged with Cephalick Pills. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel.</hi> was alſo preſcribed, and a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> with the ſpecifick Plants was her ordinary Drink. By theſe and ſuch like Preſcriptions ſhe was freed of thoſe various Diſtempers, and reſtored to a better Habit of body. The Tumour the while emptied it ſelf by the depending Orifice, and ſeverall of the <hi>Strumae</hi> which had been encompaſſed with in that Tumour appear'd again movable, and were afterwards totally reſolved by the application of <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Malagma,</hi> and by the Apertion made by the Cauſtick cured perfectly. The <hi>Strumae</hi> on the other ſide of her Neck, which ſeemed ſuppurated when I firſt came to her, did all ſave one harden again, (during her Courſe of Phyſick.) That one lay upon her Cheek near her Ear. I opened it, and thruſt out a Cheeſy Matter; then dreſſed it as aboveſaid with Deterſives, and cured it. The Patient being thus happily recovered, I ſupplied her with a Rowl of <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Malagma,</hi> by which the remaining <hi>Strumae</hi> were reſolved or ſuppurated: and ſince that I have ſeen both ſides of her Neck freed of that Diſeaſe. Yet ſhe is ſtill ſubject to ſome little Indiſpoſition of body, enough to ſhew that there yet remain ſome ſeeds of that Diſeaſe in her <hi>Viſcera.</hi>

                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged 34 years, of a ſickly weak Conſtitution,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of Strumous Ulcers on both ſides of the Neck.</note> ſubject to the <hi>King's-Evill</hi> many years on both ſides of her Neck, ulcerating, and the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers paſſing their Matter one into another down to the Clavicles, had gone through long Courſes of Phyſick, and had permitted divers Applications to be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:95669:151"/>made: but they proving unſucceſsfull, ſhe put her ſelf into the care of Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> and my ſelf. The Ulcers ſeemed to have riſen from ſo many diſtinct Glands, and that after Suppuration, the Matter, growing virulent, corroded under the Lips, and both rendred them Sinuous, and at length Callous, and conſequently not capable of Cure but by laying open. Yet I began with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives, and diſcutient and drying Fomentations. The Phyſician preſcribed lenient Purgatives, with the addition of <hi>Calomel.</hi> once in 4 or 5 days, and on the intermitting days <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> with <hi>antimon. diaphoret.</hi> Theſe not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our expectations, I proceeded in the laying open the Ulcers, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the callous Lips, there being not one that would cure till that was done. Afterwards they digeſted, incarned, and cicatrized from the edges firm and ſmooth, by the common method of dreſſing Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>A Citizen's Daughter,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of Strumous Ulcers in the <hi>Axilla</hi> and Arm.</note> aged about 12 years, of a weak Conſtitution, had been long diſeaſed with the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi> She had one Strumous Swelling on the right ſide of her Neck cloſe above the Clavicle, from whence to the <hi>Os hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri</hi> there ſeemed to be a more then uſuall fulneſs. Under that <hi>Axilla</hi> lay an Ulcer, and another on the outſide of the ſame Shoulder, and others down all along to the Elbow, ſome of them ſordid. By ſearch of a Probe theſe Ulcers appeared to be ſo many Eruptions from the Sinuous Ulcer in the <hi>Axilla.</hi> I dreſſed them with Deterſives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and preſcribed a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, Chinae, lign. lentiſc.</hi> with ſome of the antiſtrumatick Plants, <hi>milleped.</hi> &amp;c. with which ſhe took <hi>antimon. diaphoret.</hi> and once in 4 days a few grains of <hi>Calomel. cum pulv. rhab.</hi> in the form of a <hi>Bolus.</hi> I embrocated the Gland near the Clavicle and the Swelling of the Shoulder daily with <hi>valentia digitalis,</hi> and endeavoured the Deterſion of the Ulcers with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> Praecipitate, and the Vitriol-ſtone: but the Ulcer being Sinuous, (as I ſaid) it would not digeſt in any one part. The Fluxion increaſing greatly, and ſeeming to flow from that Ulcer in the <hi>Axilla,</hi> I laid it open: but that not ſerving my purpoſe, I cut open the upper part of the <hi>Sinus</hi> on the outſide of the Arm near the Shoulder, hoping that way to intercept the flux of Humour: but the Fluxion continuing, I began to ſuſpect the Matter flowed from the Strumous Tumour near the Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; wherefore I opened it, and upon ſearch found the Matter did paſs from thence into the <hi>Axilla,</hi> and to the outſide of the Arm. I diſcharged the Matter, and eradicated that <hi>Struma:</hi> after which the Fluxion diminiſhed in the other Ulcers. That of the <hi>Axilla</hi> dried up ſoon after: the other alſo cured more eaſily, accoridng to the method ſet down in Sinuous Ulcers, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her perfect health.</p>
                     <p>A Woman came out of the Country with a diſeaſed Child of 2 years old. She had brought many into the world,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of Ulcers in the Head, Neck, Lips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> but they had been all lamentably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, and died one after another. This was broken out all over the Head, and ulcerated in many places to the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> It had alſo a large white Tumour lying deep under the left Jaw to the <hi>Trachea arteria.</hi> I fomented the Head with a Decoction of Cephalick Herbs, <hi>cum flor. roſ. rub. bacc. myrtill. balauſt.</hi> in Wine and Water, and dreſt the Ulcers accordingly as they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſome with Digeſtives, others with Deterſives, and others with Epulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and to the Tumour I applied Diſcutients. During theſe Applications I purged the Child once in 4 or 5 days, giving it 4 or 5 grains of <hi>Calomel.</hi> over night, and in the morning <hi>ſyr. de rhab.</hi> in medicated Ale of <hi>ſarſa, lign. len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſc.</hi> &amp;c. and the intermitting days <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> Before I put her into this Courſe, the Humours were ſo acrimonious, that the leaſt ſcratch with a pin terminated in a corroſive Ulcer: but after ſhe had proceeded in this method a while, they all healed. So that there remained onely the Tumour under the Jaw, which ſeeming full of Matter, I thought reaſonable to open: but ſhe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95669:151"/>having privately conſulted ſome perſon, who, in conſideration of its ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thinking it dangerous, diſſwaded her from it, upon notice thereof I left them. But ſome weeks after, having tried other Endeavours unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſhe came to me again; the Child being broken out for want of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the former method of <hi>Calomel.</hi> &amp;c. and alſo diſeaſed with a Cough. I began with the opening of the Tumour, deſigning to doe it by Cauſtick: but in conſideration of the Prognoſtick which had been delivered of it, I made an Apertion with a Lancet, and paſſing in a <hi>Cannula,</hi> diſcharged a ſpoonfull or two of a purulent Matter: which confirming my Judgment of the Tumour, I ſtopt it up with a Tent, applied a Cauſtick the whole length of it, and the next day divided the Eſcar, and gave vent firſt to a purulent Matter, then to an albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Humour. I dreſſed the Ulcer with Doſſills ſpred with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> and the externall Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. lumbricor.</hi> After Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Ulcer fill'd up with an <hi>Hyperſarcoſis,</hi> as all Strumous Ulcers are apt, and ſo render our labour vain. Therefore timely to prevent it, I dreſſed it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and kept the Orifice dilated with Doſſills. While I was thus eradicating the <hi>Struma,</hi> I repeated the former method of Phyſick, and healed the ſeverall Ulcerations about the Head, Face and Lips. All things thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well, the Mother returned into the Country with her Child, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, (ſuppoſing it cured:) but ſhe not taking Specificks with her to proſecute that method there, it languiſhed and died, as I was afterwards informed.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about 3 years old had an Ulcer with <hi>Caries</hi> upon the right ſide of the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> cloſe by the Temporall Muſcle.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of an Ulcer with <hi>Caries in Cranio.</hi>
                        </note> It took its originall from an <hi>Atheroma,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, (the Child having ſome <hi>Strumae</hi> on his Neck.) The Bone lay carious the compaſs of half a <hi>Guinny.</hi> I took off the Lips of the Ulcer by Cauſtick, and dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> to keep it dry till Nature ſhould be diſpoſed to make Exfoliation of its rottenneſs. For in this tender Child there was no talk of raſping, nor was there always liberty to put in my Doſſills ſo cloſe as I ought to have done. During this work the Child was afflicted with the Meaſils, and in the declination of them with a Cough, and ſuch a diſcharge of Matter from his Lungs, that he grew thereby Hectick, and emaciated to skin and bone. The Lips of the Ulcer on his Head lay lank and dry, and the Bone as it were dead without moiſture. He being thus weak, Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> was conſulted, and declined the attending it, as coming too late to him. Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> was perſwaded to take care of him, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Pectoralls of various ſorts, and adviſed the removall of him to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> where he drank Aſſes milk. Having there ſomewhat recovered, he was removed to a houſe near <hi>Kings-Gate,</hi> into back Lodgings looking into the Fields, for benefit of the Air, and more conveniency of Dreſſing the Ulcer on his Head. But upon the change of the Air he ſo relapſed in 2 days, that it was believed, if he had lain one night more there, he had died there. Upon which conſideration he was again removed back to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> and there he daily recruited his ſpirits. As his ſtrength recovered, the Lips of the Ulcer recovered their heat, and digeſted, the <hi>Caries</hi> of the Bone caſt off, and the Ulcer contracted narrower. He afterwards removed farther off into the Country to his Parents: my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſeman</hi> attended him, and finiſhed the Cure there.</p>
                     <p>A Child about 3 years old was brought by its Mother out of St. <hi>Martin's Lane</hi> to me with a large ſoft Swelling upon the left ſide of the Head without inflammation. I, ſuſpecting the Bone carious,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of <hi>Atheroma</hi> with <hi>Caries</hi> on the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi>
                        </note> applied a proportionable Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick on it, and gave vent to a Matter not unlike Batter, and by ſearch of a Probe felt the <hi>Cranium</hi> bare, I dreſſed it with Lenients, and after ſeparation
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95669:152"/>of the Eſcar ſaw the <hi>Cranium</hi> bare the compaſs of a broad Shilling. I dreſſed it up with <hi>liniment.

By theſe Applications the Bone incarned, united with the Lips of the Ulcer, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrized from the edges round. During which ſome ſmall Speels of Bones caſt off, and the Ulcer cicatrized without much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>A ſickly Child of about 7 years of age was brought to me by its Mother out of <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi>

The third day, taking off the Dreſſings, I ſaw the upper <hi>Lamina</hi> very white, dry and thin: it was corroded, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med chambered like unto that Fracture the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Camaroſis,</hi> or like ſome piece of old worm-eaten Timber. I dreſſed it with Doſſills preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and the Lips of the Wound with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinthina cum vitell. ovi,</hi> &amp;c. embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum oleo roſ.</hi> After Digeſtion of the Wound I deſigned the raſping away that thin Shell: but her pain ceaſing, it was deferred. About the tenth day ſhe was taken with a Fever. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician viſiting her, I dreſſed her Head, and offered to his conſideration the ſetting on a Trepan. But he concluded the Fever ſcorbuticall, and no way related to the Ulcer <hi>in Cranio.</hi> But the Fever increaſed, and ſhe died. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician being indiſpoſed with the Gout, another was fetcht, who ſaw her ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. At the taking off the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the interiour <hi>Lamina</hi> appeared ſound, and the <hi>Dura mater</hi> unconcerned; nor was there any Bloud or Matter extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated between the Membranes or Ventricles of the Brain; but in the Lungs a great Stagnation. When this Matter affects onely the interiour <hi>Lamina,</hi> the Patient generally dies before the Malady is diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>A little Girl was brought by her Mother to me with a ſoft Tumour,<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of a <hi>Struma</hi> with <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Os Zygoma.</hi>
                        </note> of the bigneſs of a Nutmeg, upon her left Cheek, on the <hi>Os Zygoma.</hi> She deſired me to undertake the Cure. But I, being at that time much indiſpoſed in my health, declined the meddling with it, concluding the Bone carious, and that it was not ſo ſlight a work as ſhe thought. The Mother went from me to a Chirurgeon then in my Neighbourhood, who opened it, and took
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95669:152"/>much pains in the exfoliating the Bone: but it growing more carious, he at length left the Parents at liberty to make choice of ſome other. They came to me again. I made ſearch with a Probe, and felt the <hi>Sinus's</hi> running un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bone towards the Eye. I dilated the Ulcer, and, ſeeing the Bone black, applied a Doſſill preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> on it, kept the Orifice open with a Doſſill ſpred with a Digeſtive, and embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> dreſſed it up with <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> By his way of dreſſing the pain was mitigated, and the Ulcer digeſted. I continued the uſe of the Doſſill with <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> to the Bone daily, and dreſſed the Ulcer with a Pledgit of <hi>diapomphol.</hi> By this very method the rottenneſs of the Bone ſoon ſhell'd off: after which, by leſſening of the Doſſills, I permitted the Ulcer to incarn, and by gradually leaving off the uſe of the Doſſills, and dreſſing it with Pledgits of <hi>diapompho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyg.</hi> it cicatrized firm in the ſpace of three weeks, and continueth ſo to this day.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about 26 years of age came to Town with an Ulcer in her Cheek penetrating high under the <hi>Os Zygoma:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers with <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Os Zygoma.</hi>
                        </note> there was alſo an Ulcer near the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>Canthus</hi> of that Eye. I ſuppoſed them to have coherence with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by ſearch of a Probe felt the Bones carious. Her Cheek had been much apoſtemated and blemiſhed by their Chirurgery in the Country, and like to be made worſe, if the Bones were that way to be exfoliated. Wherefore I conſidered to doe it otherwiſe. The Teeth in that <hi>Maxilla</hi> were all ſound and faſt; yet I perſwaded her to the pulling out of one under theſe Ulcers. She ſeemed to receive ſome advantage by it, the Ulcer mattering leſs for the ſpace of 4 or 5 days: but both the Ulcers growing afterwards worſe, and our hopes of Cure that way failing, I enlarged the lower Orifice, and rubb'd off the over-grown callous Lips with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and proceeded in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terging and digeſting the Ulcers. During which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> was conſulted: but upon ſuppoſition ſhe might be with Child, ſhe took little Phyſick. By dilating the inferiour Ulcer the uppermoſt cloſed up, that Matter diſcharging it ſelf by the Ulcer beneath, but not without much diſturbance, it threatning a <hi>Sinus</hi> down her Cheek. To avoid which, I cauſed an Inſtrument to be made whereby I cut between her Cheek and Jaw into the Ulcer to the carious Bone, and gave vent to the Matter. After I had thus laid open the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away the bloud, I dreſſed it with a Tent dipt in <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and the externall Ulcer on the Cheek with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion cicatrized that ſmooth and firm. The Ulcer within her Mouth grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offenſive to her by reaſon of the foetid ſmell of the Bone, put me upon the uſe of an Injection of <hi>aq. roſ. damaſc. ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and a few drops of <hi>tinctur. vitrioli</hi> Felix wortz: by which the Ulcer deterged, and grew daily leſs offenſive. I continued the dreſſing it with a Tent whilſt any thing of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharged. That ceaſing, I omitted the uſe of Tents, and healed up the Ulcer, and ſo it is like to continue.</p>
                     <p>A Child between 3 and 4 years of age,<note place="margin">14 Obſervat. of an Ulcer with <hi>Caries</hi> behind the Ear.</note> having been ſubject to ſoar Eyes and an Abſceſſe in one of its Ears, was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and commended to my care. The Matter at length made its way forth behind that Ear, and flowed in great quantity. Upon ſearch I found the Bone carious. I began my work with Dilatation of the Ulcer by Gentian-roots; and after I had made way to it, I dreſſed it with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> and <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> upon Pledgits, or ſuch like, accordingly as I ſaw occaſion. Having thus diſpoſed the Bone to Exfoliation, I purged the Child with <hi>infuſ. rhab.</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with <hi>Calomel.</hi> once in 4 or 5 days, and preſcribed <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> alſo a medicated Ale, to take the intermitting days.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time, ſeeing the Bone continue firm, I dreſſed it with a mixture
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95669:153"/>of <hi>mel Aegyptiac. pulv. myrrh.</hi> &amp;c. and thereby haſtened the Exfoliation of the Bone. That being caſt off, I deſigned to cicatrize the Ulcer: but perceiving the Eyes grow ſoar, I put a Pea into that Ulcer, and continued it a Fontanell; not thinking it ſafe to dry up the Ulcer behind the Ear, though the Child had before one proper for Derivation. The dreſſing this Ulcer was never very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but the Servant that attended the Child having accuſtomed her ſelf to put it beſide its Frowardneſs by threatning to ſend for me, it ſo terrified the Child, that it always cried at the very ſight of me; upon which account I left her in the condition I have repreſented. She was long after diſeaſed with ſoar Eyes from the acidity in her Bloud, but hath ſince outworn it.</p>
                     <p>From a <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Alveoli</hi> Apoſtemations are frequently made externally under the Jaws; which being not unlike ſtrumous Tumours, are by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced people ſuppoſed to be ſuch, and ſent to us to be preſented to his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Many Inſtances may be given you of this kind, if it were neceſſary: but they not being Strumous, I ſhall forbear, and preſent to you what is, <hi>viz.</hi> the protuberant Jaws. They are made hollow by an acid Humour, which fretteth and corrodeth the <hi>Alveoli</hi> and inner ſubſtance to the very externall Shell; in which caſes they thruſt out with great deformity. I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſeaſe under the name of <hi>Spina ventoſa,</hi> and diſtinguiſhed it from the <hi>Caries</hi> ariſing from an externall Eroſion by that name. When this affects the Jaws, the Teeth grow looſe, and Excreſcences do ariſe, which in progreſs of time thruſt out the Teeth. They ſometimes diſcharge their Matter exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. But by pulling out thoſe Teeth theſe Apoſtemations cure, and the Jaw having thereby vent for its Matter, the <hi>Caries</hi> will caſt off inſenſibly by the force of Nature, and at length, if the Habit of body grow better diſpoſed a <hi>Callus</hi> fills up the void ſpace in the Bone. But where Nature is deficient, we conſume the <hi>Caries</hi> in them by deterſive and drying Medicaments, or by actuall Cautery: after which, if the Patient be young, he groweth out the Deformity.</p>

I cauſed ſome of thoſe Teeth to be pull'd out, and dreſſed the Ulcer with a Tincture of Vitriol.

She had formerly Apoſtemations under that Jaw externally; but the Matter having made its way out by looſening ſome of her Teeth, (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dropt out,) thoſe Ulcers were in a manner healed up. The place where her Teeth had fallen out was fill'd with a putrid Fleſh, which was very offenſive to her by reaſon of the rottenneſs of the <hi>Alveoli.</hi> In this caſe there remained nothing to doe, but to conſume and dry up the corrupt Fleſh and Bones; which I did by actuall Cautery to the very end of the Mandible, laying it hollow like a Trough. I was troubled in my thoughts to ſee it ſo, ſuſpecting it would prove an unthankfull work, to leave ſuch a uſelſes Cavity: but it was done to ſave that Jaw. I dreſſed it up with Doſſills dipt in a mucilaginous Decoction, and after Digeſtion with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> the ſides of the Mandible were dried by the actual Cautery, and being thin, they caſt off, and the Gum lay flat, and ſerved her afterwards to chew ſofter food.</p>

                     <p>In anſwer to this, I adviſed the extracting of the carious Teeth, to make way for the diſcharge of Matter, and propoſed Remedies to conſume the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs in the <hi>Maxilla.</hi>

                     <p>About half a year after the Patient was brought to me by his Uncle Mr. <hi>Tho. Chol.</hi> He had then a <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> or <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> very large upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the ſaid Jaw, which threatened a totall corruption of it. They deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my judgement in the taking it off. I reply'd, If the Bone be thin, it may be cut off by paſſing an Inciſion-knife within his Mouth between the Cheek and his Jaw. If upon triall the Bone prove too hard or difficult to extirpate, the Wound will ſoon cure without Deformity. This was delivered by me with ſuch heſitation as might have well ſhewed the little inclination I had to operate in it. Three or four months after the Patient came to me with his Uncle Captain <hi>Middleton,</hi> and earneſtly deſired me to proceed in the cutting out that <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> the way I had diſcourſed of formerly to him. I adviſed them to conſult Phyſicians and Chirurgeons in the undertaking. They conſented to it, and ſent to Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> (who had been one of his Phyſicians in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,)
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:95669:154"/>Dr. <hi>Water Needham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer.</hi> We accordingly met, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther informed our ſelves of the nature of the Tumour and its ſituation, then retired to conſult. The firſt queſtion propoſed was, whether the <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> might be cut ſafely off: which was unanimouſly granted. The next conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was, of the way to take it out. But we differing therein, concluded to defer the Operation till the <hi>Caries</hi> in the Jaw ſhould by its eruption make its own way through. Somewhat to this purpoſe we all ſubſcribed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Patient; which he threw into the fire, and departed much unſatisfied with ſuch a dilatory Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>The third day after we were conſulted again, and concluded that Inciſion ſhould be made between the Cheek and Jaw to the <hi>Exoſtoſis,</hi> and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as the Bone ſhould be diſcovered by the Knife to be hard or ſoft, ſo we ſhould proceed in the ſawing it off, or permitting the Wound to heal again. This we ſubſcribed, and ſent to the Patient; and I afterwards diſcourſed with him and his Uncle, and prevailed with them, that thoſe who had been conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted might be preſent at the Operation. Accordingly they ſent to them. In the mean time his Body was prepared by a purging Apozeme 4 or 5 days. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeſection was deferred, in conſideration that bloud would be evacuated in the Operation.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Operation, the Patient having ſeated himſelf in a clear light, I paſſed my Knife between the outſide of his Jaw and his Cheek cloſe to the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Exoſtoſis</hi> the length of it, and at that inſtant attempted the cutting of it: but it was too hard. I declared ſo, and asked them whether I ſhould pull out the Knife. They all unanimouſly, with the Patient and his Uncle, declared that I ſhould proceed with the Saw; of which there were two provided of equall ſize with the Knife. I pulled out the Knife, and paſſing in the Saw to the very <hi>baſis,</hi> made a track: then put the Handle of the Saw into one of the Phyſician's hands, deſiring them they would ſeverally help in the ſawing off the Bone; ſo ſhould they be more ſatisfied in the work, and eaſe me, who was too much indiſpoſed in my health for ſuch a buſineſs. They did ſeverally take their turns, and had at that time ſawed off the Bone, if we had not been interrupted by the wearineſs of the Patient, and the bleeding of a ſmall capillary Artery in the Cheek. I dreſſed up the Wound with Doſſills of Lint, to keep it dilated, and thereby ſtopt the bleeding. We embrocated the externall parts with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over it. The third night the Wound bled afreſh, whether it was cauſed by eating, or what other accident; but my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſeman</hi> ſtopt it with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe dipt in the Royall Stiptick held cloſe with his fingers, and was relieved by others. But the Patient not permitting them to hold the Compreſſe ſo cloſe on as Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> and myſelf adviſed, the Veſſell was the longer in agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and raiſed an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> of the bigneſs of a Lupin, which lying in our way, we burnt it down by a ſmall Button-cautery. This difficulty over, we all met again, and proceeded in the ſawing off the Bone, and did all of us ſuppoſe we had finiſhed that work, (which Opinion was occaſioned by the <hi>Caries</hi> within it, which admitted of our Probes, and made the whole Bone ſeem looſe,) and purpoſed then to extract it. But he pleading his wearineſs, we complied with him, dreſſed up the Wound with a Tent dipt <hi>in vitello ovi,</hi> and ſomenting the externall Parts, dreſſed them with Lenients; by which the parts were eaſed, and the Wound diſcharged a well-digeſted white Matter. In this condition I left the Patient (with their leaves,) to make a Journey into the Countrey 4 or 5 days; during which I grew more indiſpoſed, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home grievouſly diſeaſed, yet made a ſhift to viſit the Patient, and urged the extraction of the Bone. Whether it was that he heard the Wound was to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95669:154"/>be inlarged, and that he feared a Flux of bloud, but he put them off from day to day, and during my confinement to my Chamber I had news of an approach of Convulſions; upon which I was carried to him, where we all met at a Conſultatioon, and Dr. <hi>Lowre</hi> with us. It being ſuſpected that this Accident was occaſioned by ſome Shivers of the Bones pricking the Membranes, we reſolved to haſten the extraction of them: but his Teeth being ſet, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no poſſibility of doing it that way. Therefore we reſolved to apply a Cauſtick on the lower part of the Jaw externally, and by cutting through it to draw out the Bone. My hands being weak, Dr. <hi>Lowre</hi> marked it, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they applied the Cauſtick, reſolving to meet again that afternoon to divide the Eſcar, and take out the Bone. But within few hours after the Patient ſent for us to take off the Cauſtick. I went, and found an Eſcar made as was deſigned, but I had not ſtrength enough in my hands to make uſe of a Knife. Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> were at a publick Diſſection in our Theatre, where Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> was Reader: onely Dr. <hi>Lowre</hi> and <hi>Jaques Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were to be found. They being come, my Kinſman divided the Eſcar, made ſeparation of the Bone, and drew it out. I afterwards put in my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and feeling no Shiver, adviſed the dreſſing it up with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> hot. That evening they all met, and approved of what had been done, and hoped the cauſe being taken away, the effects would have ceaſed. Dr. <hi>Goddard</hi>'s Drops were preſcribed, and Venaeſection had been propoſed; but being diſputable, it was deferred. The next morning Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> met us at a Conſultation, and adviſed the Patient to be let bloud, the Hair of his head to be ſhaved, bliſtering Plaiſters to be applied, and variety of internall Medicaments were preſcribed; the Wound was opened and dreſſed: it was not without good hopes of Digeſtion, but the Patient died convulſive the third day after.</p>
                     <p>The Patient's Cheek was laid open in the preſence of all the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons. The Bone was found ſawed off without the leaſt impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Jaw; but it was very much eaten into by the <hi>Caries,</hi> and was ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. The cauſe of the Convulſions ſeemed to be referrable to the Conſtitution of his body, and the Acrimony of the bloud, which upon fluxion fermented, and produced that ſad effect. We ſee frequently the ſame in little Maladies. The onely drying up of a light Excoriation behind the Ears in Infants hath cauſed Convulſions. In the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Evill</hi> you may ſee many Inſtances of the fermenting of this kind of Matter moſt grievouſly upon the healing ſome one Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The Monument at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> of the young Lady holding up her Finger prickt with a Needle, of which ſhe died, may ſerve to ſhew you that in ill Habits of body ſmall Wounds are mortall. As to this Operation, it was not dangerous, if you conſider the great Fractures in the Jaws which we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure; and that of late years I cut into the inſide of a man's Cheek, ſawed in pieces the <hi>Alveolus,</hi> and took out the whole Jaw, and cured him. That the Operation was neceſſary, appeared by the rottenneſs in the Jaw upon diſſection, and may be determined by all thoſe who know what a <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> is, and conſider the progreſs this had made in ſo ſhort a time.</p>

She had alſo a frequent diſcharged of purulent Matter from her right Ear; alſo an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> and thick upper Lip chapt. I cauſed the cruſted Matter in her Noſtrills to be ſuppled by the frequent injecting of <hi>decoct. hordei. ſem. althaeae,</hi> &amp;c. and afterward deterged the Ulcers with a Solution of <hi>mel magiſtral.</hi> in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction <hi>rad. biſtortae, tormentillae, ireos,</hi> &amp;c. The Lip was dreſſed daily with a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum</hi> of <hi>unguent. roſat.</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat. Vigon.</hi> and the <hi>Gummi</hi> upon the Neck and Fingers were embrocated with <hi>unguent. magiſt. ad ſtrumas,</hi> and an <hi>empl. ad tophos</hi> applied over all. During which Applications the Child was frequently purged with <hi>Calomel.</hi> and <hi>diagrid.</hi> and drank a <hi>decoct. ſarſae. radic. bardanae, ſcrophul. maj. flor. ſalviae, beton. anthos,</hi> &amp;c. But the Cure not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with theſe, I gave her a few grains of <hi>theriac. metall.</hi> by which ſhe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livated: during which the Gummy Tumours reſolved, and the ſeverall Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations dried up: yet to confirm her Cure, ſhe took Sudorificks, and purged frequently.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about eight years of age was brought to me with a pituitous Swelling in his right Ancle and Foot.<note place="margin">2. Obervat. of a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Ancle.</note> His Parents ſuppoſed it cauſed by ſome diſtenſion of that Joint, and had applied anodyne relaxing Medicaments. But upon obſerving the Bones of the Ancle to be preternaturally big, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the originall of the Diſeaſe in them, and that the Swelling in the Parts about proceeded from the dilatation of the Membranes and Ligaments of that Joint. I declared the Cure to be a work of time: we not having yet diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any Medicaments of force to dry up that Humour in the Bone, and reſtore it to its former ſmalneſs. That which was offered by me was, to diſcuſſe and dry up the ſerous Humours affecting the ſofter Parts, by Bandage to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe them, and reſiſt the Influx, and the while to evacuate and contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſerous Humours. This being accepted of, I began with the fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with <hi>decoct. ſummitat. abſinth. majoranae. Jacobeae, flor. hyperici, ſalviae, roſ. rub. balauſt. bacc. myrtill.</hi> &amp;c. in Wine and Water, with the addition of <hi>ſpir. vini.</hi> I then applied an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with a laced Sock over it, adviſing that Leg to be laid level with the Body till the Fluxion ſhould be remitted, and the Joint ſtrengthened. During which the Patient was purged weekly with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel. in conſ. roſ. damaſc.</hi> adding ſometimes a few grains <hi>reſinae jalapii,</hi> or <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grid.</hi> and the intermitting days he drank <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> &amp;c. and took thoſe mornings <hi>Bezoard. mineral. cum ſyr. è cort. citri.</hi> Thus at length the Humours were contemperated, and the Joint ſtrengthened; and as the patient grew more in years, the other Ancle increaſed proportionably to it, and leſſened the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>I could give you many Inſtances of theſe Tumours; but the Cure not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from what hath been ſaid of this, I though it unneceſſary. What the conſequences of theſe Tumours are when ſuch method is neglected, you may ſee in ſome of the latter Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>An Infant ſcarce a year old,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of aſtrumous Tumour by Congeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in the undreſſing of it, was diſcovered to have a round ſoft white Swelling on the head of the Shoulder. It was thought over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Nurſe. A Phyſician was conſulted, then a Bone-ſetter, who declared it luxated, and pretended he had ſet it: but his frequent coming to dreſſe it, and the remaining Tumour, ſhewed that he underſtood not what he did. I was fetched, and opened it by Inciſion, giving vent firſt to an albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous, then to a white concocted Matter; upon which the Tumour ſunk. I fomented it with Red wine, and dreſſed it with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> with <hi>empl. diachalcit.</hi> Compreſſe and Bandage, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terged it with an addition of <hi>mel roſ.</hi> then left off the uſe of Tents, and in few days cured it with <hi>unguentum diapompholyg.</hi> This Infant was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95669:155"/>diſeaſed 5 or 6 years with the <hi>Kings</hi>'s-<hi>Evill</hi> affecting other Parts.</p>
                     <p>Such another like Tumour did riſe in the top of the Shoulder of a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of the like; and of a ſtrumous Tumour in the Thigh.</note> the onely Daughter of its Parents. At the Nurſe's firſt diſcovery of it, ſhe ran with it to the Bone-ſetters. They all concluded it out of Joint, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pretended he had ſet it. But the Swelling continuing, I was fetched; and, opening it by Inciſion, diſcharged ſuch a like Matter as in the former Obſervation, and cured it as ſoon, after the ſame manner as aboveſaid. This Child was afterwards afflicted with a very large Tumour lying deep under the Muſcles on the inſide of one of its Thighs. After divers Applications to reſolve it, it at laſt came to Suppuration, and diſcharged an impure Matter; but was deterged and cured by the ordinary method ſet down in Putrid Ulcers, without any ſeeming defect in the Member. But ſome months after, the Infant uſing its Legs, this appeared much ſhorter then the other, yet without any manner of contraction or ſtiffneſs of the Member. I deſigned an Inſtrument for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of it; but the Child being extreamly froward, I declined it. After ſhe was grown of more years, I was conſulted again: but it was then too late.</p>
                     <p>One about 19 years of age, of a ſeeming healthfull Conſtitution,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe on the Elbow.</note> was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeized with a white Swelling in his right Elbow, rendring the Joint immovable. Though he could not remember any particular action of his that ſhould diſlocate it, yet he was perſwaded to conſult the Bone-ſetters. They all concluded it out, and endeavoured to reduce it; thereby haſtening an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemation amongſt the Ligaments and Tendons, which diſcharged its Matter through many Orifices on the inner and outer ſide of the Joint, making part of the Bone carious. Some of the declining Orifices I laid open, and deterged them; during which he was purged, and preſcribed Antiſtrumaticks. Injections were caſt in of that ſort propoſed in Sinuous Ulcers with <hi>Caries,</hi> alſo diſcutient and corroborative Fomentations were applied. By all which at length the Tumour reſolved, the Ulcers cured, and by frequent Embrocations he recovered a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable uſe of that Joint.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about 3 years old, healthfull from its Cradle,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe on the Hip.</note> was on a ſudden taken lame in its right Hip. The Lameneſs increaſing, he was brought to me. I compared the Hips, and found that ſwelled, and the Leg beginning to ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. I embrocated the Tumour <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> applying <hi>emplaſt. è bolo,</hi> and his Leg <hi>cum ol. lumbricor.</hi> I preſcribed him a medicated ſmall Ale with <hi>Sarſa,</hi> &amp;c. and purged him once aweek with Rhubarb infuſed in ſome of the ſaid Drink, giving him the night before a few grains of <hi>Merc. dulcis,</hi> and the intermitting days <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> By this method he was relieved; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the omitting it he relapſed, but at length recovered. Others of this kind I have had under my care: but partly by reaſon of the progreſs the Diſeaſe had made before, and partly through the Impatiency of the Parents, the Cure hath failed.</p>
                     <p>A Youth of about 12 years of age was ſeized with a pain in his right Hip.<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of the like.</note> It increaſing with Tumefaction and great Lameneſs, the Parents, ſuſpecting it might be out of joint, ſent for <hi>Thurland</hi> the Bone-ſetter. He declared it luxated, and pretended to ſet it, and dreſſed it up his way. The Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing lame, they ſent for him again. He aſſured them he had ſet it, and that in time the Child would recover ſtrength in it, and be well. But the Child growing daily more pained, Chirurgeons were conſulted, and at laſt my ſelf. I ſaw the head of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> ſhot upward, and a large Tumour poſſeſſing the Hip and Parts about, under which there ſeemed to be lodged Matter. There was alſo a long white Swelling ſtretching down the forepart of the Thigh, from the Groin towards the Knee, within 4 fingers breadth of it. The Tumour
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95669:156"/>ſeemed to be full of Matter, and to derive it ſelf from the Hip, and that the Luxation had been made by Fluxion, and increaſed by the Extenſion. But however it was, the Bone was not capable of Reduction, nor could I promiſe my ſelf any credit from my Endeavours there; yet I complied with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, reſolving to ſerve them as well as I could; but deſired that the Bone-ſetter might be firſt fetched to ſee his work: I not thinking it ſafe to meddle in the Cure, whilſt he inſiſted that the Bone was reduced. They ſent often for him, but he did not come, till I accidentally met him at a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Lodging, and by threatning brought him with me to the Child; where he acknowledged his fault, and declared the Bone incapable of reduction. Yet this Fellow went directly back to that Perſon of Honour, and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand where he had been, declared that he had been with me, to ſet my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Hip, and that he had reduced it.</p>
                     <p>This Fellow's ſcurvy uſing me almoſt diſcouraged me in the undertaking: but after making a preſentation of it, I attempted the Cure, and began with diſcutient Fomentations, Embrocations, and Emplaſters, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure, till I had diſcuſſed part of the externall Tumour, and ſatisfied my ſelf that there was Matter lying deep under the Muſcles of that Joint. Then, to prevent farther corruption of thoſe Parts, I applied three ſeverall Cauſticks on them at one time: after which I divided the Eſcars, and penetrated deeper into them with a Cauſtick-ſtone, and by Inciſion gave vent to the Matter (which was partly albuginous) in the ſeverall Parts; then fomented them, and dreſſed them up with Lenients, to haſten ſeparation of the Eſcars. The next day I applied a Cauſtick upon the declining part of the Abſceſſe on the fore-part of the Thigh, and diſcharged much purulent Matter. By the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this at firſt, I might have diſcharged the Matter above: but that being the Part immediately affected, it was not probable to cure it thereby, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Opening would have been more difficult. And indeed, though by one ſingle Apertion on the Hip the Matter might have been let out; yet ſuch a large Abſceſſe would not have cured ſo: and afterwards to have cut through ſo many Muſcles, muſt needs have been hazardous. But their lying thus tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular ſerved to good purpoſe not onely in diſcharging the Matter, but for conveniency of deterging; which after ſeparation of the Eſcars I did with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi</hi> and <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and kept thoſe Orifices ſo open, that I could paſs my Probe out of one into the other till they were deterged, and the Matter little in quantity and good. During which, the Matter in the other Abſceſſe diſcharging daily in great quantity, and being of ſo virulent a quality as to retain its Cavities, and render the Lips phagedaenous, I ſnipt the Abſceſſe more open according to its length, and deterged it as the former, then purged him with <hi>reſina jalapii, Calomel.</hi> &amp;c. and gave him the intermitting days <hi>Bezoard. miner.</hi> His conſtant Drink was a medicated Ale with <hi>ſarſa, lign. lentiſc.</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>millepedes.</hi> By this method the Humours were digeſted, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ulcers incarned and cicatrized by the common method of Cure. During which his Leg was kept ſtreight; and time hath ſince made the place callous which received the head of the Bone, ſo that he walks tolerably well on that Leg.</p>
                     <p>A Youth of about 9 years of age was taken lame with a pain in his left Hip.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe on the Hip.</note> Bone-ſetters were adviſed with, alſo Phyſicians and Chirurgeons were conful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and many Applications made; he was likewiſe carried to the <hi>Bath:</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their Endeavours, the pain increaſed with great Tumefaction. I was at laſt conſulted, and felt the head of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> luxated and raiſed upward, with a great Tumour about it, which I judged by its fluctuation to be full of Matter. It was expected I ſhould open it, and give vent to the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95669:156"/>ſame: but this Child being emaciated and Hectick, and the Matter lying deep, as in all theſe Strumous Abſceſſes it doth, the Solution beginning in or near the Joint, I declin'd the preſent Opening of it, and propoſed the drying up of that Matter by powerfull Exſiccants and Diſcutients, <hi>viz. aq. calcis,</hi> and <hi>empl. diaſulph.</hi> with convenient Bandage. During which the Phyſician preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed lenient Purgatives, with <hi>Calomel. decoct. ſarſae, Bezoard. min.</hi> &amp;c. by which method the Patient was more eaſy, and ſeemed relieved for a while. But the Tumour increaſing upon the leaſt neglect in rowling, and appearing by its fluctuation to be full of Matter, I complied with their deſire, and opened it by a large Cauſtick, giving vent to an albuginous Matter. I made ſearch, and felt the Bone bare. I haſtened ſeparation of the Eſcar; and afterwards fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Skin thinner in the declining part of the Tumour, and judging that convenienter for diſcharge of the Matter, I opened that part by Cauſtick. Having now made way for the Matter, I caſt in an Injection of <hi>Decoct. rad. irid. ariſtoloch.</hi> &amp;c. with a Solution of <hi>unguent. fuſcum.</hi> After ſeparation of the Eſcar, I inlarged the Orifice towards the old one, and ſaw the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> lying out of its <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and black with its Rottenneſs. I dreſſed it with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and kept the Ulcer dilated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what Nature would doe: but in the while the Child languiſhed, and died tabid.</p>
                     <p>A Girl of about 9 years of age, born of a diſeaſed Mother,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe on the Hip.</note> having been ſome months lame of a Swelling on the Hip, was brought to me. It ſeemed to me that the head of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> was luxated by a defluxion of ſharp Matter, and that there was ſmall hope of Cure. I applied <hi>empl. diaſulph.</hi> with a laced Trowze, and preſcribed Antiſtrumaticks. In progreſs of time the Tumour increaſing, they brought her again to me. When I had conſidered the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of it, and that if there were Matter in it, it lay too deep to be reached with a Cauſtick, I propoſed the application of a pointed actual Cautery about the head of the Joint, hoping I might that way at leaſt give timely vent to the Humour, and prevent the corruption of the Ligaments and Bones. To which purpoſe I applied three ſmall Cauſticks triangular about the moſt tume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part of the Joint, and the next day paſſed in an actuall Cautery through each Eſcar, dreſſed them up with Lenients, and fomented the diſeaſed Part daily with an Infuſion of Diſcutients in <hi>aq. calcis</hi> and <hi>empl. opodel F. W.</hi> over all. As the Eſcars caſt off, a thin <hi>Sanies</hi> diſcharged, and the Tumour ſeemingly diſcuſſed: but then on a ſudden it ſwelled; which put me upon the uſe of a maturative Cataplaſm, by which it ſuppurated, and diſcharged its Matter through the former Apertions. But afterwards obſerving theſe Openings would grow too little, I paſſed in a ſmall Probe with a Ligature into one of theſe, brought it out at one of the other, and kept them open by that Seton, then proceeded again with Diſcutients and Internalls. Some months afterwards theſe two Openings were laid into one, and the Orifice kept dilated with Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills ſpred with Deterſives, and the Abſceſſe was again reſtored to a healing condition. But after all my Endeavours, new Apoſtemations aroſe, and the Child died tabid.</p>
                     <p>A Young man of about 18 years of age, being lame of his left Knee,<note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of a Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance in the Bone of the Knee.</note> ſent for a Bone-ſetter, who declared the Bone luxated, and would have extended it. The next day I was ſent for, and ſaw a Protuberance on the inſide of the Bone, a pituitous Swelling on each ſide of the <hi>Rotula,</hi> and a painfull Swelling on the other Parts about the Knee. Theſe, with the Protuberance of the Bone, made the Joint ſeem ſomewhat luxated at firſt ſight: but upon farther, ſearch, that Prominence was in the Bone it ſelf, and is uſuall in ſtrumous Tumours of the Knees, Ancles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hath been taken notice of by <hi>Aquapend.</hi> under
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95669:157"/>the name of <hi>Spina ventoſa.</hi> I have taken notice of it in ſeverall places of this Treatiſe, and ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it again in ſome of the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I concluded this Diſeaſe to have been originally in the Bone; and, upon farther enquiry, did diſcover that the Patient had been diſeaſed of the Knee from his Childhood more or leſs. I directed an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> to be applied on the Knee, to calm the heat in the Part, then let him bloud, and afterwards purged him. The next day after I cauſed his Knee to be fomented with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients and Exſiccants infuſed <hi>in aq. calcis</hi> ſome days, and afterwards applied <hi>empl. diaſulph.</hi> with a Knee-piece, and diſpoſed him to walk with more eaſe. About a year after he came to me again complaining of it, and will be ſubject to pain in it at times whilſt he lives. This was the caſe of a perſon Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Needham</hi> and my ſelf were lately conſulted about: and ſuch are frequently ſeen at our publick Healings, they being generally accompanied with other marks of the <hi>Kings-Evill.</hi>

                     <p>A perſon of about 9 years of age,<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of a Tumour on the inſide of the Knee.</note> of a tender Conſtitution, ſubject to a Cough and other effects from an acidity in her Bloud, was afterwards diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to be lame of her right Knee, ſuppoſed to happen by ſome accident of a Fall. I being ſent for ſaw the Bone on the inſide protuberant, and covered with a white Swelling. It was poſſible that ſuch an accident of a Fall might contribute to the haſtning of that Swelling: but it was certain that the Protu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of the Bone was of a longer growth. She had a Species of an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> as alſo a <hi>Struma</hi> ulcerated in her left Arm. I did ſuſpect this Tumour would prove difficult of Cure, and therefore deſired they would conſult their Phyſician. In the mean time I applied an <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> The third day after I met Dr. <hi>Mickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwait.</hi> The Tumour was then ſpreading over all that ſide of the Knee. It was reſolved by us to endeavour Diſcuſſion, by the application of <hi>empl. diaſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris:</hi> which was accordingly done. The Phyſician preſcribed as followeth. ℞ <hi>ſarſaparillae inciſ.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>Chinae nodoſae</hi> ℥i. <hi>ſaſſafras</hi> ℥iij. <hi>rad. ſcorzoner.

We divided the Eſcar, and diſcharged about 3 ſponfulls of a thin white Matter; then dreſſed it up with Lenients, and <hi>empl. diachyl.</hi> The Matter diſcharged between Dreſſings very well, yet the Tumour did not leſſen: but upon preſſure with my hand above near the Thigh, the Matter guſhed out. Upon which conſideration we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Cauſtick there. It did not reach it: but upon keeping that part open as a Fontanell with a Pea, the Matter made its way out there, but in the mean while it inſinuated it ſelf below the firſt Apertion; which put me upon the laying that Orifice open lower. Having thus made convenient diſcharge of the Matter, I applied Intercipients above about the Thigh, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Digeſtives and Deterſives with Compreſs and Bandage to diſpoſe the Ulcers to cure. But the Matter, originally riſing amongſt the Membranes and Tendons, lay deep, and affected the Joint with great virulency, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the very Lips of the Ulcer. Upon which conſideration I would gladly have laid it open from one Orifice to the other: but the weak condition of the Patient obliged me to cheriſh the native heat of the Part by Fomentations <hi>ex
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95669:157"/>ſummitat. abſinth. hyperici, flor. roriſmarin. beton. ſalviae, roſ. rub. balauſt. bacc. myrt. juniper.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in vino rub.</hi> and to alleviate the pain in the Ulcers, till the Habit of body ſhould be better diſpoſed by thoſe internall Preſcriptions, to which were added Emulſions, with <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> medicated Broths, Aſſes milk, Jellies; what not? The Summer coming on, ſhe was bathed in Milk and Water lukewarm, and by cordiall Juleps her ſpirits were kept up. By theſe various Preſcriptions the Fermentation in the Humours was calmed, and her Hecticall heat remitted, alſo the Defluxion upon the Ulcer diminiſhed, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> was in a condition to be laid open. I deſigned to have done it by one ſnip of a Probe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſors: but it being ſuſpected ſhe might thereupon faint or fall into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, I laid it open by Cauſtick; and from that time digeſted, incarned and cicatrized. I met with many rubs in the work, it frequently fretting out in one part as it healed in another: and after a year and a half's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I left a ſmall Ulceration on the upper part of the Knee, of the breadth of a ſilver Half-peny, and a ſinuous Ulcer in the hollow of the Thigh near the Knee, which was not capable of being laid open. In that I order'd a hollow ſhort Tent of Lead, whereby it was kept open, and the Matter was ſeemingly diſcharged, it ſcarce at all mattering. Her Leg was all this while kept out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched, whereby ſhe was able to ſtand or walk. In this condition ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to drink the Waters at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and returned afterwards ſo well, that they were thought to have cured her: yet ſhe hath been ſince frequently ſubject to Eruptions, but her Attendant is her Chirurgeon.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about eight years of age was brought to me in the year of the great Plague during my being in the Country.<note place="margin">12.

There had been one on the left ſide, but it had been formerly opened at <hi>London,</hi> and left ſinuous. I began with the laying it more open by Inciſion; and having deterged and diſpoſed it to cicatrize by the common ethod of curing Ulcers, I opened the other beneath the <hi>Rotula,</hi> and gave vent to an albuginous Matter, then laid it open the whole length, and dreſſed it with Doſſills ſpred with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi.</hi> This being deterged, and diſpoſed to incarn, I then opened the third, and diſcharged the ſame kind of Matter. I deterged it as the former, and by the addition of <hi>pulv. myrrhae, ſarcocoll.</hi> &amp;c. incarned it. I cicatrized the ſecond with <hi>unguent. è calce,</hi> and having diſpoſed this to doe ſo, I left him to his Chirurgeon, who cicatrized it. During the cure of the Ulcers, the Ham was daily embrocated with <hi>unguent. dialthaeae, ol. lumbricor.</hi> &amp;c. and was brought out ſtraight, and left flexible by me. Soon after he recovered ſtrength of it, and walketh now well on that Leg.</p>
                     <p>Another about 7 years of age was brought out of the Country on me,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of the like.</note> and lodged near me in <hi>Convent-Garden.</hi> He had been 2 years exceedingly lame of his left Knee by reaſon of the like Swellings about the <hi>Rotula;</hi> his Ham was alſo retracted, and his Leg emaciated. I began with the ſtuping them with <hi>aq. calcis</hi> wherein had been infuſed <hi>ſummitat. hyperici, hyſſopi, majoranae, flor. ſambuci, chamaem. roſ. rub. bacc. myrt. juniper.</hi> &amp;c. and applied <hi>empl. diaſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris,</hi> &amp;c. But the Swellings not diminiſhing thereby, I opened that beneath the <hi>Rotula</hi> firſt, and the reſt afterwrds. That on the outſide of the <hi>Rotula</hi> was an <hi>Atheroma,</hi> and grew ſinuous; and upon ſearch I ſelt the Cartilage bare. I laid it open the whole length, kept it ſo with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> and <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and attended the Exfoliation. During which the Patient was purged with <hi>Calomel.</hi> and <hi>diagrid.</hi> once aweek, and on the intermitting days drank a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> &amp;c. were alſo preſcribed. Emollient Embrocations were made to the Ham, and a laced Knee-piece put on to make Compreſſion, and diſpoſe the Lips of the Ulcers to cicatrize: by
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95669:158"/>which two of the Ulcers ſoon cured, and ſome while after the other incarned and healed to the very Cartilage. I kept it dilated with a Doſſill, and thereby the Matter leſſened daily, and that Ulcer cured (by leaving out the Doſſill) without any viſible Exfoliation. The Ham was much relaxed: but there being ſome contraction remaining, I fitted him with an Inſtrument which by virtue of its Screws gradually extended the Joint, and diſmiſſed him with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his Parents.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about ſix years of age was brought to me with ſoar Eyes,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of a Tumour on the right Knee.</note> and a white ovall Swelling on the inſide of her right Knee. I applied a Cauſtick on it, and the next day opened it. It lay deeper then the Cauſtick had reached; and the Inciſion appearing too ſmall for the emptying of it, I laid it more open with a ſnip of my Probe-ſciſſors, and diſcharged a Cheeſie Matter. I then dreſſe it up with Digeſtives, and the fourth day took off Dreſſings, and ſaw part of the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> come away with my Doſſills. I dreſſed it with <hi>mundif. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſi,</hi> and having thereby deterged it, I added Sarcoticks to the Mundifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and commended the proſecution of the Cure to their neighbouring Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, with direction to proceed with Internalls to evacuate and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the acid Humours. Many Inſtances of this kind I could preſent you: but they not differing in the manner of Cure, I ſhall forbear, and give you one Inſtance of the ſad conſequences of theſe Tumours.</p>
                     <p>A Young man,<note place="margin">15. Obſervat. of Tumours on the right Knee.</note> 19 years of age, had been lame from his Childhood with ſeverall of the aforeſaid Swellings about the <hi>Rotula</hi> of his left Knee, with a retraction of the Ham: he had alſo Glands ſwelled <hi>in Inguine,</hi> &amp;c. At length a Defluxion ſeized upon the uppermoſt Tumour of the Knee, and increaſed it and the reſt with great pain. A frequent Vomiting and <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> accompanied it, and ſometimes a Cough. I being conſulted endeavoured to reſiſt the ſeverall Acidents by Pectoralls, Opiats, Cordialls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and began the Chirurgery by the application of a Cauſtick on the Tumour above the Knee, by which I gave a great diſcharge to a purulent Matter; then dreſſed it up with Lenients, hoping to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the Matter in its deſcent downwards: but before that Eſcar ſeparated, the Matter made its way down to the externall parts of the Knee; which put me upon the neceſſity of opening it there, and afterwards on the inſide of the Knee, and in two ſeverall places of the Joint it ſelf. In ſome of which I felt the Cartilages and Bones corrupted; to which I applied an actuall Cautery, and afterwards kept them open by a Paſte made of <hi>pulv. rad. ariſtoloch. rot. pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> &amp;c. Having thus given evacuation to the Matter by the ſeverall Apertions, I fomented the Parts with Stupes wrung out of a diſcutient and corroborative Decoction, and applied Cataplaſms <hi>ex far. fabar. hordei, lentium, flor. roſ. rub. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. decocted in ſome of the forementioned <hi>Fotus,</hi> with the addition of <hi>oxymel ſcillitic.</hi> &amp;c. then by the application of <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> Praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and the Vitriol-ſtone, I deterged and diſpoſed the Ulcers to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that on the upper part of the Knee healing up. But the while I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Exfoliation of the Bones, the <hi>Caries</hi> increaſed, and the Patient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing died at laſt tabid.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about 6 years of age was brought to me extremely emaciated.<note place="margin">16.

                     <p>One about 13 years of age, grievouſly diſeaſed with the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi>

                        </note> was commended to my care. He had a <hi>Struma</hi> on the right ſide of his Neck movable, and of a round figure: he had alſo a <hi>Struma</hi> ulcerated in each Arm; the one on the inſide near the Elbow-joint, and the other on the outſide of the <hi>Biceps.</hi> His right Hand was ulcerated near the Bone leading to the firſt Joint of the Thumb, and paſſed its Matter cloſe by the Bone to the inſide, corrupting the Bone. One of his Ancles was much ſwelled and ulcerated on the inſide in ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which Ulcers upon ſearch with a Probe appeared to have communication with one another, and ſerved for the diſcharge of an abſceſſe lying in the Joint, with corruption of the Bone. He had alſo in the Groin of the ſame ſide a Cluſter of <hi>Strumae;</hi> which I ſuppoſe were occaſioned by the anguiſh in the Ancle. Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſer</hi> and Sr. <hi>Fra. Prujean</hi> were his Phyſicians, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him medicated Broths, traumatick Decoctions, with other Specificks proper in his weak condition. I began my work with the laying open thoſe Ulers in his Hand and Ancle by Cauſtick, and proceeded by Deterſives to conſume the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis,</hi> and make way to the Bones, accordingly as hath been ſhewed in the Treatiſe of Ulcers. After I had made way to them, I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them with Doſſills preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> keeping thoſe Ulcers dilated. During which I endeavoured to digeſt the ulcerated Parts about, and cicatrize them to the carious Bones, likewiſe to cheriſh the native Heat in the Members, and defend them from Fluxion by good diſcutient and corroborative Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and Bandage. By this means the Matter daily leſſened, and the Patient recruited his ſtrength. I attempted the Exfoliation of theſe Bones ſome days, by dreſſing them with a Solution of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. ſpir. vini, pulv. myrrhae, euphorb.</hi> &amp;c. upon Doſſills hot; and it ſucceeded well to that <hi>Caries</hi> on the Hand. But the Corruption was too great in the Ancle-joint to yield to that Medicament; wherefore having healed that Ulcer to the <hi>Caries,</hi> I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an actuall Cautery through a <hi>Cannula.</hi> At the firſt application, preſſing upon the <hi>Caries,</hi> the Matter ſpurted out upon us. I pull'd out the Cautery and <hi>Cannula,</hi> and dried the Ulcer with armed Probes, repeating the uſe of the Cautery till I had conſumed the <hi>Caries;</hi> then dreſſed it up with Lenients, to appeaſe the heat. After two or three days I dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and the Lips of the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. alb. camph.</hi> and attended the Exfoliation. During which I laid open thoſe Ulcers in his Arms by Cauſtick, eradicated the <hi>Strumae</hi> with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and cicatrized them. I alſo cut the <hi>Struma</hi> out under his Jaw, and ſoon cicatrized it. The Ulcer on the Bone leading to the Thumb was a painfull work, the Tendon lying over the <hi>Caries;</hi> which put me at laſt upon the laying open the Ulcer on the inſide, and applying my Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95669:159"/>that way, by which I exfoliated the Bone more eaſily, and cured the former Opening the while, and this ſoon after. The <hi>Caries</hi> in the Ancle was ſlower in Exfoliation, and did not caſt off its Shell till I touched it with <hi>ol. vitrioli:</hi> after which it ſoon exfoliated, and the Ulcer cured. The Tumour <hi>in Inguine</hi> was embrocated with <hi>valentia digitalis</hi> during the Cure, but did not reſolve till afterwards. The Cure of this perſon was the work of a year, and was ſo doubtfull for ſome time, that it was difficult to determine which ſhould be diſmember'd firſt, Hand or Foot. But he happily enjoys the uſe of both, with a perfect good health, to this day.</p>
                     <p>A weak ſickly Child,<note place="margin">18. Obſervat. of a <hi>Struma</hi> on the right Foot.</note> about 10 years of age, was commended to my care by Dr. <hi>Mapletoft.</hi> She had a <hi>Struma</hi> ſuppurated on the right Foot amongſt the Tendons and Bones leading to the two leſſer Toes: I ſuſpected them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. But there being a neceſſity of opening it, I applied a Cauſtick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and gave vent to an albuginous Matter, and felt thoſe Bones bare from the <hi>Tarſus</hi> to the firſt Joint of the Toes. I fomented the Part affected with a diſcutient Decoction, and dreſſed the Eſcar with Lenients, to haſten ſeparation of the Slough: and as it began to ſeparate, I deterged with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and the Vitriol-ſtone, making way through the luxurious Fleſh to the <hi>Caries.</hi> Then with Doſſills dipt in <hi>mel roſ.</hi> and <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and preſt out, I dreſſed the Bones, and kept the Ulcer ſo dilated, as to ſee the Bones ſo far as they were carious. But in the applying my Doſſills, they preſſing upon the Tendons, rendered the Ulcer painfull, and ſubject to great Defluxion of a thin ſerous Matter, and threatened worſe miſchief. To remedy which, I cut off thoſe Tendons, dreſſed up the Ulcer with Digeſtives, and applied Refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerants externally to reſtrain the Fluxion. At the next dreſſing, finding the Tendons contracted, and the Bones more eaſie to come at, and ſeeing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliation of them by Medicaments like to be a tedious work, the Matter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made its way under them, threatening Apoſtemations in the Sole of the Foot, I reſolved to attempt them by actuall Cautery. To which purpoſe I dreſſed them with Doſſills of Lint, to dilate them more for my view; and the next day I burnt them the whole length; then with my <hi>Forceps</hi> pinched them to pieces, and pull'd thoſe broken bits out: after which I cleanſed the Ulcer, and applied my Doſſills preſſed out of a mucilaginous Decoction between and over the ends of the remaining Bones, dreſſing up the Ulcer with Digeſtives, and applying externally Compreſſed dipt <hi>in aceto</hi> wherein had been infuſed <hi>ſal nitri, myrrh.</hi> &amp;c. over which a laced Sock was put on. Thus I reſtrained the Influx, and preſſed forth the Matter from its ſeverall Cavities. Yet I was neceſſitated to make afterwards an Apertion through the Sole of the Foot, and to lay open the Ulcer beneath the Ancle, for the readier diſcharge of Matter. I continued the application of Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> to the ends of the Bones, till a <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt forth, fill'd up the void ſpace, and ſupplied the want of the Bones During this work, the Patient was afflicted either with a Cough, <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> or Vomiting: in all which caſes Dr. <hi>Mapletoft</hi> aſſiſted with various Preſcriptions, and contemperated the acid quality of her Bloud: after which by good Nouriſhment the Child recovered her ſtrength. She being thus at length diſpoſed to a fair way of Recovery, the Ulcer near cicatrized to the Bones, and there being nothing more to doe but to keep it open with dry Doſſills and a Pledgit of <hi>diapompholyg.</hi> with the uſuall Bandage, I by degrees left it to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dreſs, and ſaw the Child afterwards upon her Feet; and at length ſhe recovered. And thus Time may be ſaid to contribute much to the Cure of this Diſeaſe: but without the Chirurgeon's carefull attendance, they miſerably languiſh and die. For Amputation in this Diſeaſe ſignifies little, the Ulcers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Caries</hi> in one Part while you are extinguiſhing them in another.</p>

His Body being opened by his Phyſician, his Lungs were diſcovered full of <hi>Strumae.</hi> The other, a Youth about 12 years of age, had the while a Soar burſt forth of his Thigh, and had been dreſt by a neighbouring Apothecary. His Brother being dead of the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> the Relations enquired into the cauſe of this Youth's Lameneſs, and diſcovering ſeverall white Swellings about him, brought him to me. That Ulcer which the Apothecary dreſſed was ſtrumous. He had one <hi>Struma in Perinaeo,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther large one upon his right Thigh, and two upon that Leg. On his left Leg there was one upon the head of the <hi>Fibula</hi> near his Knee, another upon the Calf of that Leg, a very large one lying on the outſide of that Ancle, one lying upon the middle Toe of the ſame Foot, and two upon his right Arm. Theſe were all ſuppurated, and there was great ſuſpicion that the Bone was carious in thoſe of his Ancle and Toe. In order to the Cure, they required all to be laid open. But how the Patient could bear ſo great an evacuation at once, I much doubted: and to open them one after another, would be a ſlow way of proceeding, and ſubject to many inconveniences. I concluded it beſt to lay them all open at one time, while he was in heart, and had ſtrength to bear it. To which purpoſe I cauſed a quantity of ſoft Cauſtick to be made, and the next day applied it proportionably large upon every one, ſo as to take off all their Covertures, and diſpoſe them to a healing condition. For a ſimple Opening in theſe Tumours ſignifies nothing, but to render them ſo many ſinuous Ulcers. The Eſcars being made, I divided them, and gave vent to the Matter in the ſeverall Tumours, then dreſſed them with Lenients to haſten Digeſtion. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Dr. <hi>Tho.

Then I conſumed and dried the <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bones of the Ancle and Toe with actuall Cauteries, penetrating very deep into that of the Ancle; and repeated this way again and again, till I had waſted the humidity in each Part of it: then dreſſed them with Doſſills of Lint preſſed out of Red wine, and the Parts about with Refrigerants. After I had thus calmed the heat in the Ulcers, I kept the Bones dry and bare by the application of Doſſills <hi>in ſpir. vini,</hi> and attended their Exfoliation.

I digeſted and cicatrized theſe Ulcers to the Bones, but could not make them exfoliate, till I had burnt the ends of them with an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cautery; and then they caſt off but ſlowly. The Ulcer in the Ancle I cicatrized down to the Bone, that it lay dry; yet did that Bone make no haſt away. During my attendance on theſe, a Swelling aroſe on the outſide of one of his Arms near the Elbow. He concealed that from me till it was grown very large, and ready to burſt. There alſo aroſe in one night a <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> on the Fore-finger of the ſame Hand where the other aroſe: upon which I applied an <hi>empl. de ranis cum Mercurio dupl.</hi> I laid open the <hi>Struma</hi> upon his Arm with a Cauſtick, and endeavoured Digeſtion in it by the method uſed in the Cure of the other <hi>Strumae:</hi> but it grew corroſive, and reſiſted my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. I conſulted Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> again; and conſidering the acidity in his Bloud and the approach of Winter, we thought I neceſſary to attempt ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, to prevent farther miſchief; and together concluded that he ſhould be put into a light Salivation. Accordingly I attempted it with <hi>Merc. dulcis.</hi> But he having taken of that all along, it worked downwards; and he being weak, I durſt not move it by Vomit. But by Suffumigation I raiſed it, and ſalivated him about 17 days: during which the Ulcer in his Arm cured, and the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> on his Hand reſolved. But that other in the Bone of his Fore-finger increaſed, with great Inflamation and Tumour. In the declination of his ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we purged him, and ſweat him with a Decoction of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> &amp;c. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he drank his former preſcribed medicated Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> recovered daily his ſtrength, and grew fleſhy; his Ulcers healed up, and the Bones caſt off in the Ancle: ſo as there remained onely a piece of the compaſs of a ſilver Two-pence, and that looſened and thruſt off by virtue of a <hi>Callus,</hi> which, cicatrizing with the Lips of the Ulcer, made a firm <hi>Cicatrix.</hi> Yet the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> remained, and raiſed a ſmall Apoſtemation on the inſide of the Finger. I laid it open by Inciſion to the Bone, and ſaw it ſmooth and white. I penetrated into it with an actuall Cautery, and dried it, then dreſſed it with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and digeſted, incarned and cicatrized it to the Bone. Having thereby diſpoſed it to Exfoliation, and concluding him as it were cured, I left him Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to dreſs it, and others to judge of my work, I taking the while a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the Country. At my return I received a Letter from his Mother, dated at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> that the Bone was caſt off, and his Finger cured. Since which time he hath enjoyed good health, and is grown a man.</p>
                     <p>A Man aged 23 years,<note place="margin">20. Obſervat. of a Tumour on the Foot.</note> of a tolerable good Habit of body, was diſeaſed with a white Swelling on the inſide of his Foot beneath his Ancle down to the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95669:160"/>Heel. There ſeeming to be Matter in the upper part of the Tumour. I laid it open by Cauſtick, and diſcharged an Atheromatous Matter in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, then dreſſed it up with Lenients. At the next dreſſing, finding an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Matter, I made a ſearch with my Probe, and felt a <hi>Sinus</hi> running to the Heel. I laid it open thither, and dreſt up the wounded Lips with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinthina cum vitell. ovi.</hi> After digeſtion of the Ulcer, I felt the lower part of the Heel-bone bare. I proceeded in the healing of the upper part of the Abſceſſe, by laying the neather part open to the Bone, and dreſſing the Bone with Doſſills of Lint to keep it dry and dilated to my view. I afterwards ſaw it bare the compaſs of a Groat: it appeared white and pory. I continued the method of dreſſing; and after I had diſpoſed the reſt of the Ulcer to a healing condition, I conſulted Dr. <hi>Denton,</hi> who had a kindneſs for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. He met me at the poor man's Lodging, and ſaw the Ulcer dreſſed, and thoſe Inequalities with a <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bone. We applied an actuall Cautery to it, and kept it dry with Doſſills, according to cuſtome, attending its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliation; the Phyſician preſcribing Internalls, and taking care of his health. Thus all things ſucceeded well, as we thought: but ſome while after he was ſeized with a <hi>Phrenitis.</hi> He had no Fever, yet died ſome days after, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our Endeavours by Bleeding, Cupping, Bliſtering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>A Child of about ſeven years of age having been diſeaſed with a Swelling on the outſide of her Heel the ſpace of two months, it apoſtemated,<note place="margin">21.

Her Friends being informed it was the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> recommended her to me. I ſaw her Hectick, and upon a ſearch into the Ulcer felt the Bone carious, but had no order to dreſs her till about two months after; and then I began with the laying open the Ulcer, and bringing the Bone into view. Which after I had done by Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I perceived it ſo looſe that I could eaſily have taken it out whole: but it looking white, and ſeemingly ſound, I perforated it with a <hi>Terebra,</hi> and felt the externall part of it hard: though after I had pierced that, I felt the interiour parts ſoft and rotten. I applied a Bolt-cautery into that Perforation, to dry up that humidity: but the Matter ſpurted out of it. When I ſaw it irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt, I reſolved to take it out: to which purpoſe I invited Sr. <hi>Charles Scarburgh,</hi> who upon ſight of it agreed to the pulling it out. I laid hold of it with my <hi>Forceps,</hi> and eaſily drew it forth, not a drop of bloud following it: then dreſſed up the Ulcer with Sarcoticks, and put on a laced Sock, to bring the Parts cloſe and ſhape the Heel. Sr. <hi>Charles</hi> preſcribed Internalls, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her often. I proceeded hopefully for a month or two: but there had been formerly a cluſter of <hi>Strumae</hi> in that Groin, which had been raiſed by the anguiſh of the Ulcer in the Heel, that apoſtemated, and diſcharging its Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down the Thigh, terminated in a ſinuous Ulcer, which exhauſted her ſtrength ſo that ſhe died tabid.</p>
                     <p>A Child about 7 years of age was commended to me by Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox.</hi>

That on her Leg was ſuppurated: this of the Heel burſt ſome weeks before ſhe came out of the Country, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged its Matter by a ſmall Opening.

To the <hi>Strumae</hi> in her Arms I applied <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Malagma,</hi> and diſpoſed them to Reſolution. The Ulcers in the Leg and Heel being deterged as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, they healed in few weeks: but the latter brake out again the third day, and confirmed me that it was carious. I went one morning whilſt ſhe was aſleep, and applied my mildeſt Cauſtick on it; and after digeſtion of the Eſcar I made a ſearch, and penetrated at leaſt half an inch deep into the Bone. I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given ſuſpicion to the Parents of the <hi>Caries,</hi> and it now appearing to have riſen originally out of the middle of the Bone, I thought it neceſſary that they ſhould conſult ſome Chirurgeon in order to the Cure of it. Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> met the Phyſician and my ſelf, and after ſearch declared the <hi>Caries</hi> as I had repreſented it. He approved of the dilating the Ulcer, and dreſſing the Bone dry. <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. Bezoard. min.</hi> &amp;c. were then reſolved on and preſcribed by the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The next day I began with the dilating the <hi>Sinus</hi> with prepared Sponge, and having brought it to view, I dreſſed it daily with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and the while healed the Ulcer down to the Bone; by which the great diſcharge of Matter which ſo frequently threatens a Hectick in others was prevented, and our work ſucceeded well. But this Child had a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother in the Country, that out of abundance of kindneſs to the Child did much fruſtrate her Cure, not onely by her frequent Letters, but alſo by a Woman ſhe ſent up, who pretended to Chirurgery, and ſeeing the Ulcer without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, ſwelling, or conſiderable diſcharge of Matter, reported to her that it was an inconſiderable Soar, and would ſoon cure, if the Chirurgeon did not keep it open by thruſting Lint into it. Others both in the City and Country informed the Grandmother, that the caſting off of the Rottenneſs in the Bone was the work of Time, and that the Ulcer needed no ſuch Dreſſings as I applied. Upon which ſhe perſiſted in ſoliciting the Parents to bring the Child back to her in the Country. Theſe things coming to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge put me upon as great a deſire to be freed of the Patient, and made me cautious in the dreſſing the Bone: for it did certainly require the actuall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; but I dreſſed it onely ſome days with an armed Probe dipt in a Solution of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> and <hi>extract. ſcordii</hi> ſcalding hot, and afterwards with Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills dipt in a Compoſition of <hi>ol. myrrhae diſtillat.</hi> &amp;c. by which at length the Rottenneſs ſeemed to be caſt off. I likewiſe complied with all their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leaving out the Doſſills, and permitting the Ulcer to Time. At the firſt leaving out the Doſſlls the Ulcer contracted, and being callous, and dreſſed with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> retained an Opening large enough to diſcharge its ſmall quantity of Matter: which gave hopes of its being as it were cured. The laced Stocking with Compreſſes under it reſtrained the influx of Humour, and ſtrengthned her Foot ſo that ſhe walked tolerably well on it. But not long after he Bloud fermented, and the Small-pox burſt forth abundantly, threatning her life. But ſhe happily recovered out of them: yet from that time her Eyes began to be afflicted with ſharp Defluxions, and the Humours fermented in one of the Glands in her Arm, which was ſeemingly before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. This put me upon the opening it by Cauſtick, and proceeding in the Cure: which I did, and accordingly ſoon cured it. In order to the Cure of her Eyes, Fontanells were made, Leeches applied behind her Ears, bliſtering Plaiſters to her Neck, Intercipients to her Temples, and Applications were made to her Eyes; lenient Purgatives and Alteratives were alſo repeated: by which ſhe was relieved. But they being weakened by the Defluxion, were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95669:161"/>ſubject to it. Thus ſhe returned with her Parents into the Country, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Directions from hence. After her being there ſome time, her Heel apoſtemated, and I was conſulted by Letter. But her Grandmother, liſtening to every Prattler, governed the Child accordingly, and I ſuppoſe it continues ſtill diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged 16 years, of a ſeeming healthy Conſtitution,<note place="margin">23. Obſervat. of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſe in the Foot, with rotten Bones.</note> was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with a pain in her right Foot. Various Remedies were applied; a Bone-ſetter was alſo employed, But the pain increaſing with Tumour, a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon was entertained; who, after ſeverall Applications, ſeeing ſomewhat like a Suppuration, opened it: but from that time it growing more ſinuous, and the Swelling greatly increaſing, he conſulted others of his Profeſſion, and afterward left her to be dreſſed by one and another. After ſhe had languiſhed near the ſpace of a year and half, I was conſulted, and found her Foot lapt up in a Cataplaſm. Upon the taking which off, I ſaw it extreme big, and all apoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, diſcharging its Matter round, at the outſide, inſide, Sole of the Foot, and Heel, ſo that it was eaſy to paſs a Probe through any way. The externall Ulcer on the Foot was large, and overgrown with an <hi>Hyperſarcoſis:</hi> the Bones within the ſaid Foot were moſt of them carious in one part or other; ſome of them were rotted to pieces. If this Patient had been tolerably ſtrong of Body, Amputation had been of uſe: but ſhe was emaciated, and frequently afflicted with a <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> Cough, and a great weakneſs and dejection of Appetite. Upon which conſiderations the Ulcers were ſuperficially dreſſed with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. Apoſtolor.</hi> and the Patient perſwaded that the Exfoliation of the Bones was the work of Time. But it being viſible, that Nature could doe nothing in her caſe without the help of Chirurgery in drying up the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fleſh, and making way to pull out the rotten Bones, and dreſſing of the others which were leſs carious with Medicaments accordingly drying; I decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the meddling with it, unleſs I were permitted ſo to dreſs it. Not that I had any great hopes that way: but if that were not attempted, ſhe would certainly die. At that inſtant we dreſſed up the Ulcer on the upper part of the Foot, which was overſpred with luxurious Fleſh, with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> the other with <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> &amp;c. and with Compreſſes and Bandage endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the preſſing out of the Matter, and reſtoring the Foot to ſome ſhape. This method was repeated every other day, with Compreſſes of Tow preſſed out of <hi>acetum</hi> wherein had been diſſolved <hi>ſal. nitri, myrrha, camphora,</hi> &amp;c. But finding the <hi>Fungus</hi> ſtill increaſing, we applied the actuall Cautery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at once conſumed it down to the Bone, and dreſſed it up with Lenients. From that day's dreſſing the Matter leſſened daily, and grew well digeſted. After the ſeparation of theſe Sloughs, we attempted the remaining <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> in ſome parts with the Cauſtick-ſtone, and in others with <hi>ol. vitrioli.</hi> We applied Doſſills of Lint dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> on the Bones, and ſprinkled the luxurious Fleſh in the circumference with <hi>Merc. praecipitate.</hi> as we ſaw cauſe. If this Patient had been any whit ſtronger, I ſhould have uſed the actuall Cautery oftner, and thereby laid all the rotten Bones bare, and dried them with it: but by reaſon of her weakneſs and great indiſpoſition of Body, I proceeded for the moſt part with Praecipitate, as aforeſaid, and dreſſed her twice aweek, or every third day; during which the Foot recovered a better ſhape, the Ulcers alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged leſs Matter, and ſhe was more at eaſe. Her Phyſician preſcribed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, to reſiſt the ſeverall Accidents, and corrected the acidity in her Bloud; ſo that ſhe ſeemed to recover: but of late, the weather being very cold,<note place="margin">24. Obſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers on the right Foot, Aems, &amp;c.</note> ſhe is ſubject to a <hi>Diarrhoea,</hi> and I fear will die of it.</p>
                     <p>A ſickly weak Child, ſcarce 7 years of age, having long laboured under a pain and diſcharge of Matter from many ſtrumous Ulcers, was at laſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95669:162"/>to me. He had one large ſtrumous Ulcer poſſeſſing the inſide of his right Foot, of the compaſs of a Five-ſhilling piece in ſilver, and another on the outſide of the ſame Foot, paſſing its Matter between the Bones leading to the third and fourth Toes into the Sole of the Foot. He had alſo Ulcers in both his Arms near the Elbow-joints: likewiſe a <hi>Struma</hi> ſuppurated upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Joint of his right Thumb. The middle Finger of his left Hand had a <hi>Spina ventoſa;</hi> alſo the fourth Finger of the ſame Hand was ulcerated, and the Bones rotten from the ſecond Joint to the Knuckle. In order to the Cure of this Child there was required a neceſſity of nouriſhing it, and of correcting the Habit of body: for he was extreamly emaciated, and the Ulcers were all corroſive and exceeding painfull. Upon which conſideration I declined the meddling with him till they ſhould conſult ſome eminent perſon of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who might ſee his deplorable condition, and aſſiſt in the Cure. They ſent for Sr. <hi>Fra. Prujean,</hi> who preſcribed medicated Broths, cordiall Juleps, Decoctions of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and other Specificks proper in his weak condition. Mr. <hi>Battersby</hi> was his Apothecary.</p>
                     <p>I began with the opening that Abſceſſe on his Thumb by Inciſion, whence I diſcharged a curdled Matter; and feeling that Bone carious, I dreſſed it up with a Doſſill ſpred with <hi>unguent. baſilie.</hi> and a Plaiſter of the ſame over it: the other Fingers I dreſſed with ſome of the ſame Unguent, mixt with <hi>Merc. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat.</hi> and with <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over all, endeavouring Digeſtion there. My main buſineſs being, to diſpoſe thoſe Ulcers to a healing condition which were in the Foot, which diſcharged ſo large a quantity of Matter, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the corruption of the Bones. I made a ſearch into that Ulcer on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Foot, and finding it hollow round, I ſtopt up the Orifice with a Doſſill, and applied a Cauſtick the whole compaſs of it. To the Ulcer on the other part of the Foot I alſo applied a Cauſtick. The next day I divided theſe, and after the ſtuping them with Red wine, I dreſſed them up with Lenients and good Bandage. In the dreſſing of the Ulcer on the outſide of the Foot, perceiving the Matter likely to raiſe an Abſceſſe in the Sole of the Foot, I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Seton-needle between the Bones through that Abſceſſe, and prevented its farther inſinuation by keeping that Apertion open. As theſe Eſcars caſt off, I deterged with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> or the Vitriol-ſtone, and by Epuloticks leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the Matter, and cicatrized that Ulcer on the inſide of the Foot in three months. The other Ulcer I cicatrized alſo to the very <hi>Sinus</hi> paſſing to the Sole of the Foot: but one of the Bones being there carious gave me a longer trouble. I dreſſed it dry with a ſmall Doſſill; and by keeping the Apertion open under it <hi>in planta pedis,</hi> I drained the Matter, ſecured the Exfoliation of it, and cured it ſome time after. While theſe Ulcers were digeſting and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing, I proceeded in digeſting and deterging the other Ulcers in the Thumb and Fingers. That in the Thumb I dilated with Gentian-roots, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dreſt the Bone with a mixture of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. ſpir. vini, myrrh.</hi> and <hi>euphorbium</hi> hot upon an armed Probe, and kept it dilated with Doſſils and Refrigerants over it. But finding the <hi>Sinus</hi> to abound with Matter, and the Bone render'd incapable of Exfoliating, I paſſed a ſmall flat-pointed <hi>Fiſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>-needle through the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and made way for the Matter to diſcharge into the inſide; then inlarging that Aperture, I dreſſed the Bone through it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Ulcer above to cicatrize the while. Having thus diſpoſed this Bone to exfoliate, I laid open the <hi>Spina ventoſa</hi> by Inciſion to the Bone; and after dilatation of the Lips, ſeeing the Bone white, I cut into the thin Shell, and made way for the application of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> &amp;c. by which I dried it within, and diſpoſed it to Exfoliation: and at length a <hi>Callus</hi> fill'd up that Trough, hardned into Bone, united with the Fleſh, and cicatrized firmly.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95669:162"/>The fourth Finger I would gladly have cut off: but not being permitted, I laid it open by Inciſion, pinched out a piece of that Bone next the Knuckle, and exfoliated the reſt. But the Knuckle it ſelf, being rotten, was ſo long in exfoliating, that the Joint contracted, and the Finger remains ſo weak, that it may well be asked why I took ſo much pains to keep it on. But I have told you, they would not permit it to be cut off. Thoſe Ulcers in his Arms were cured as generally all ſuch are, <hi>viz.</hi> by removing their Coverture, by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Cauſticks, and eradicating the ſtrumous Fleſh; of which I have ſaid ſufficient. Thus this young Gentleman was at length cured. He bears the marks of his Sufferings, but yet without Lameneſs or Deformity, ſave in that little Finger.</p>
                     <p>A little Boy diſeaſed with the <hi>King's-Evil</hi> was brought to me with an Ulcer between the Joints of one of his Thumbs, and the Bone carious.<note place="margin">25. Obſervat. of a ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ulcer on the Thumb.</note> I laid open the Ulcer on the inſide according to the length of the Bone, and dilated it with Gentian-roots. After Dilatation I dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills dipt <hi>in ſpir. vini,</hi> rubb'd the looſe Fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, and applied Epuloticks over it with convenient Bandage. After a few days dreſſing, obſerving the Bone rotten, I took hold of it in the middle with a pair of Nippers, pinched it in pieces, and pulled the bitts out; then cleanſed the Ulcer, and dreſſed the remaining ends with Doſſils of Lint as before. By this method of dreſſing the <hi>Caries</hi> ſeparated, and the <hi>Callus</hi> united the ends of the Bone. Upon ſight whereof I left out my Doſſills, brought the Lips together, and with Epuloticks and Bandage cicatrized it firmly. A day or two after the Child came to me with his Thumb bent inward. I reduced it, and ſent for a Tin-man, who made me an Inſtrument, which being put on and faſtned about the Wriſt, retained it ſtraight. So I diſmiſt him into the Country: but by their neglect it is ſomewhat bent.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman about 14 years of age,<note place="margin">26. Obſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers on the Back of the right hand.</note> of a weak ſickly Conſtitution from his Infancy, was brought to me ſoarly afflicted with ſtrumous Ulcers on the Back of his right hand. They had been of many years continuance, and had rotted the Bones. I ſtopt the Ulcers with Lint, and applied a proportionable Cauſtick over all. The next day I divided the Eſcar, and as it ſeparated, I rubb'd the <hi>Hyperſarcoſis</hi> with a Vitriol-ſtone, and ſprinkled it with <hi>Merc. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat.</hi> Thus I made way to the Bones, and pull'd out what was looſe and lay intangled in the ſpongie Fleſh: the others I kept bare with Doſſills dipt <hi>in ſpir. vini,</hi> applying Pledgits ſpread with Epuloticks, and Bandage over them. After I had dreſſed them ſome days, and had a full ſight of them, I pinched the moſt rotten of them in pieces, dried the others with actuall Cautery, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the dreſſing the Bones dry as aforeſaid. Mr. <hi>Hinton</hi> was the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſupplied him with cordiall Juleps and ſomewhat Antiſtrumaticall, he not being capable of much Purging; nor did he need it, for by the method aforeſaid the Bones exfoliated, and the Ulcers cured in the ſpace of eight weeks with a ſmooth and firm <hi>Cicatrix.</hi> He ſince enjoyeth his health, and ſtrength in his Hand.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the aforeſaid Patient was under Cure,<note place="margin">27. Obſervat. of an Ulcer on the left Hand.</note> a poor Woman brought her Child to me with a ſtrumous Ulcer on the left Hand ſwell'd and inflamed. I made a ſearch, and felt the Bone leading to the middle Finger bare. It not being the time of publick Healing, I made Inciſion upon it, fill'd the Ulcer with Doſſills of Lint dipt in <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and dreſſed it up with Digeſtives and <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> After Dilatation, finding the Bone looſe, and ſtarted up at that end next the Knuckle, I raiſed it, and ſeparated it from the <hi>Metacarpium:</hi> then dreſſed the Ulcer with Doſſills dipt <hi>in pulv. Galeni,</hi> and from that time deterg'd and incarned; during which it contracted narrow, and cicatrized by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the common Epuloticks.</p>

                     <p>A young Woman came out of the Country with ſtrumous Ulcers in the Bones of one of her Thumbs and one of her great Toes,<note place="margin">28. Obſervat. of Ulcers on the Thumb and great Toe.</note> near the laſt Joint of them. I laid them open by Cauſtick, and dilated them with Gentian-roots and Doſſills of Lint: afterwards I dried them with actuall Cauteries, and kept them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with Doſſills of Lint preſſed out <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> ſome weeks. During which time I let her bloud, purged her, and preſcribed Antiſtrumaticks, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as hath been propoſed in the method of Cure. One day in pulling the Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills out of the Ulcer in the Toe, a big piece of the Bone came away with them. Finding no more upon ſearch, I permitted that Ulcer to heal up by leſſening the Doſſills. But growing afterwards weary with the expectation of the Bone's exfoliating in the Thumb, I pinched off the rotten part of it, dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills as before, and ſoon after ſaw a <hi>Callus</hi> riſe out of that broken Bone, which uniting with the reſt of the Ulcer incarned it, and it cicatrized in few days after under the Doſſils.</p>
                     <p>A Child about 4 years of age,<note place="margin">29. Oſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers on the Wriſt and great Toe.</note> of a ſickly and indiſpoſed Habit of body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſed with ſtrumous Tumours, was commended to me by Sr. <hi>Alex. Fraſ.</hi> and Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> who were his Phyſicians. One of the Tumours lay tranſverſe the inſide of the Wriſt, and ſeemed to have Matter in it: the other lay upon the Joint of the great Toe under the Nail. I concluded the Bones foul in both places, and began with that on the Wriſt by the application of a mild Cauſtick. That night the Child was ſeized with a pain in its Side and a Fever. This was thought by the tender Mother to proceed from the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Cauſtick: but the Child ſoon recovering out of it, ſhe was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by her Phyſicians otherwiſe, and I was permitted to proſecute the Cure as I judged neceſſary. Whereupon I went on in dividing the Eſcar, and gave vent to a curdled Matter, dreſſing it up with Lenients, and provided againſt the next dreſſing a <hi>Fotus</hi> diſcutient and drying. At the next opening I fomented the Tumour, ſprinkled Praecipitate into the divided Eſcar, and dreſſed it up. After ſeparation of the Eſcar, the Ulcer appeared full of a luxurious Fleſh, and the Matter abounded much. I made a ſearch with a Probe, and found a <hi>Sinus</hi> between the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and the Bones carious. I laid open that <hi>Sinus</hi> by Cauſtick, and after ſeparation of the Eſcar deterged with <hi>Merc. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitat.</hi> &amp;c. and kept that part dreſſed with Doſſills preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini.</hi> There was in the Child ſuch an acrimony in his Bloud, that I could not keep the Ulcer digeſted 2 days, nor check the influx of Matter, it inſinuating it ſelf into the Wriſt in ſpight of all my endeavours. The very tranſpiration behind his right Ear ulcerated, and grew difficult of cure. Upon ſight whereof the Phyſicians preſcribed as followeth; ℞ <hi>antimonii diaphoret. in crucibulo per duas horas ignit. q. ſ. ſumat ad quantit.</hi> gr. vij. <hi>tribus horis medicin. in conſ. anthos</hi>

During the Patient's taking theſe Preſcriptions, the Matter relaxed the Ligaments and Tendons; inſomuch as, coming one day to dreſs his Hand, I found it crooked, as if it had been falling off from the Joint. I raiſed it up, and cauſing it ſo to be held, I took off the Dreſſings, and ſaw the Joint far ſeparated in the upper part. I preſently ſent to Mr. <hi>Stockdale,</hi> and directed him in the making an Inſtrument to retain the lower ſide of that Hand and Arm, and hold it even, and in the mean time I boulſter'd it up. The Inſtrument being made, I placed the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95669:163"/>Hand in it, and by Screws fixed to it I kept the Joint cloſe and firm, and did not take it off till that Ulcer was cured, but proceeded in the way of dreſſing as above ſaid, laying open ſome <hi>Sinus's</hi> on the Back of the hand, and making Compreſſion upon others. The carious Bones were dreſſed with a mixture of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. extract. ſcordii, pulv. euphorbii,</hi> and <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> applied hot with armed Probes and Doſſills: the luxurious Fleſh was dried and conſumed by Eſcaroticks, and the Ulcer cicatrized from the circumference with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. Having thus in ſome meaſure checked the Fluxion, and diſpoſed the Hand to cure, I began with that Tumour upon the Toe by the application of a Cauſtick, and gave vent to a curdled Matter. Upon ſearch, finding the Bone carious, and part of it lying under the Nail, I was neceſſitated to apply a ſmall Cauſtick thereon; which having ſoftned the Nail, I cut it off, made way to the Bone, and dreſſed it with Doſſills of Lint preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini:</hi> afterwards I dreſſed it with a mixture of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> &amp;c. upon an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Probe hot, and diſpoſed it to exfoliate. This Child had an extreme ill Habit of body, the Ulcers frequently corroding one part as it healed in others, or fermenting in his Bloud, and affecting his Lungs or his Bowells with bilious Colicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Phyſicians met alſo with much difficulty. But at length an Exfoliation of the Cartilage of the Joint of the Toe caſt off, ſo alſo the <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bone, and that Ulcer cured: 2 ſlips of the Nail alſo thruſt out from the remaining Ligament alongſt the ſides, but there grew none on the middle. The Ulcers on his Hand and Wriſt alſo cicatrized firm: but the Ulcer between the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> did not caſt off its Bones; but being well digeſted, and the Bone diſpoſed to Exfoliation, it was thought fit to ſupply them with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments and Directions, and remove him into his own Country, to take the benefit of the Air. He did ſo, and Dr. <hi>Barker</hi> of <hi>Newb.</hi> took care of him there. During his being there he recovered a better meaſure of health, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards removed into <hi>Northamptonſhire;</hi> where I attended him, dreſſed that Ulcer between the <hi>Rad.</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ln.</hi> and left my Servant Mr. <hi>Yo.</hi> who perfected the Cure. Since which time the Patient hath enjoyed his health very well, and the uſe of that Joint. And indeed, if the Member be kept in its true poſition, and the Joint above it, whether, Elbow, Knee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ſome time ſtretched out, ſuch young people fail not of the uſe of their Lims: but where the poſition of the Member is neglected, the Cure ſucceeds ill, and a Lameneſs remains ever after.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman aged 12 years,<note place="margin">30. Obſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers on the Foot with rotten Bones.</note> being much emaciated and diſeaſed with the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> was brought to Dr. <hi>Bate</hi>'s houſe, where Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> and my ſelf met at the Conſultation. He had an Ulcer on the outſide of his left Foot. Upon ſearch with a Probe the Bone leading towards the little Toe felt carious the whole length; the Foot was much ſwelled, and ſeemed to have ſeverall Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes lying amongſt the Bones of the <hi>Tarſus</hi> and <hi>Metatarſus.</hi> The way I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Cure was, by the laying open the Ulcer, and exfoliating of that Bone, and ſo to proceed in the reſt of the work as I ſaw cauſe. This being approved of by Dr. <hi>Bate,</hi> he preſcribed a lenitive <hi>Bolus</hi> with a few grains of <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi> to be taken once in 4 days, and <hi>Bezoard. mineral.</hi> witha Decoction of <hi>ſarſaparill.</hi> and <hi>lign. lentiſc.</hi> &amp;c. to be drank the intermitting days. The next day I began my work with the application of a Cauſtick, and inlarged that Ulcer; then laying the Bone bare, I found it rotten the whole length, and a <hi>Sinus</hi> ſtretching tranſverſe over the Foot, from whence a quantity of Matter flowed, which being retained by the foreſaid Bone, threatened a corruption of the reſt, as alſo a paſſing of its Matter down to the Sole of his Foot. Upon which conſideration I thought it neceſſary to remove the lower rotten Bone by pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it in pieces: but it not yielding thereto, I ſawed it, and took it out.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95669:164"/>By the removall of this rotten Bone the Matter had a free diſcharge, and I had the conveniency of applying my Medicaments to exfoliate them, and to cleanſe the Ulcer; which I did by <hi>mundif. Paracelſ. unguent. fuſc. tinctura myrrhae,</hi> &amp;c. and digeſted the Lips of the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilicon,</hi> and cicatrized them with <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> and the Vitriol-ſtone. During which I applied Stupes of Two preſt out of a Solution of Nitre and Myrrh in Wine-vinegar, and by Compreſſion with a laced Sock thruſt the Matter out of its ſeverall Cavities. Yet in declining part of the inſide of the Foot I afterwards feeling a ſmall collection of Matter which could not be diſcharged that way, I gave vent to it by Cauſtick, and digeſted it. After I had thus made way for diſcharge of the Matter, I reſtrained the Humour from flowing into the Foot, and reſtored it to its naturall figure, having no more left to doe, but attend the Exfoliation of the ſeverall Bones. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> began to purge the Patient with the above-preſcribed <hi>Bolus:</hi> but there happening thereupon a Superpurgation, he declined the repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Purge, and omitted the proſecuting of the aforeſaid Courſe preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Dr. <hi>B.</hi> upon which the Matter fermented, and cauſed a pain in the Knee of his other Leg. Dr. <hi>Bate</hi> being deceaſed, Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> was conſulted, and adviſed the repeating of <hi>Calomel.</hi> &amp;c. But it not being proſecuted, other pains aroſe. During which it happened that an old. Gentleman came in, who had formerly lived in the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and practiſed Chirurgery amongſt his Slaves. He deſired to ſee our Patient dreſſed, and ſeeing the Foot without Tumour, and the Matter little and well digeſted, confidently undertook the Cure, by the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a Wound-drink, and applying an Ointment to the Ulcers. The Parents rejoycing to hear their Son might be ſo eaſily cured, deſired me to give way to it, and permit my Kinſman <hi>Jaques Wiſeman</hi> to dreſs him with that Unguent, (which was no other then the Juice of Clowns All-heal made up with Butter or Hogs-lard.) I complied with their deſires, but withall adviſed them to leave off the uſe of the Bandage, knowing well that it would ſwell, and diſcourage the Undertaker. But they continued it; and after ſome of their Servants had learned how to dreſs him, they diſmiſſed my Kinſman. I would gladly have finiſhed the Cure, but I took my leave by the way of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein I predicted what followed: for what could be expected from greazy Ointments, but corruption of the Bones? This young Gentleman being thus taken out of my hands, gave occaſion to ſome envious men of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to report it otherwiſe to my prejudice; wherefore I have here inſerted the Letter I received from his Father in anſwer to mine.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>Sir, I do not doubt but you uſed your beſt Endeavours, and obſerved thoſe Rules and that method which your judgment thought beſt for the Cure of my Son; and conſequently you may well have thoſe Apprehenſions which you yeſterday ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me both by diſcourſe and Letter, that the way he is now in may be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, if not ruinous to him. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which intimation you will eaſily believe I am in a ſtreight, and cannot regulate my actions with that clearneſs and ſatisfaction as I deſire. But having heard of divers inſtances of undoubted truth, and from Perſons of Honour and Quality, of Cures that to their knowledge had been wrought by plain and empiricall Medicines in ſhort time, and with much eaſe, after the means more potent and noble, and managed by expert Artiſts, had been long tried, and proved ſucceſſeleſs; I reſolved, though with ſome reluctancy, to run the like adventure, and make an eſſay of Col. <hi>Midd.</hi>'s Receit, and ſee whether my Son may have the like good fortune. And being entred into that Courſe, without any diſcouragement hitherto diſcernible, and being to leave the Town to morrow, I cannot now of a ſudden recede, and take up a new reſolution. I ſhall leave my Wife here with the Child for ſome weeks: in which time if any Alteration appear

                     <p>A Child of about 5 years of age came out of the Countrey the Summer after the Burning of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">31. Obſervat. of ſtrumous Ulcers with rotten Bones.</note> with an Ulcer in his Heel and another in his Arm, with carious Bones. His Friends conſulted a Chirurgeon of their acquaintance, who perſwaded them to return with the Child into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, telling them Time would cure it. But that proving an ill Chirurgeon, and not performing it, they brought the Child again about a year after to <hi>London,</hi> and came to me with him. He was then languiſhing under a hectick Fever, the Ulcer in the Heel was very large, and the Bone totally rotten. There was alſo another upon the <hi>Os aſtragali</hi> as bad, and others upon thoſe Bones which lead to the ſecond and third Toes. On the outſide of the other Leg there was a ſinuous Ulcer, and the lower part of the <hi>Fibula</hi> was carious, as likewiſe was the inſide of that Ancle. The right Hand was ulcerated from the Wriſt up the Arm between the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> making Ulcers on both ſides of the Bones: they were alſo carious the length of between two and three inches: his Neck was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo full of <hi>Strumae:</hi> and to theſe he had an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> and a thick chapt Lip. I would gladly have declined the meddling with him, as being my ſelf then much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, and the more at the ſight of this miſerable creature, whoſe condition I knew not how to help. For to propoſe Amputation of a Leg or Arm in this Patient, might have ſavoured of much cruelty, but availed nothing, while the other Parts were ſo diſeaſed. But his Friends would have no nay: they brought him to my houſe, and obliged me to dreſs him. I began my work with that Ulcer beneath the Ancle on the inſide of the Foot. The Opening being ſmall, and the Ulcer and <hi>Caries</hi> large underneath it, there was a neceſſity of laying it open to come to the Bone; Injections ſignifying nothing there but to make the Ulcer more ſinuous: yet the laying it open was hazardous, by reaſon of the Artery which paſſed over the carious Bone: but there was no avoiding it. Therefore placing the Child upon a Table near me, I applied a Cauſtick, upon the Abſceſſe. Then, while it was working, I dreſt the other Ulcers, which was at leaſt an hour's work. That done, I cauſed an actuall Cautery to be put into the fire, ready for my uſe in caſe need, then took off the Dreſſings from the Foot; and finding the Cauſtick had work'd as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figned, I made Inciſion overthwart the Eſcar to the Bone, by which I divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Artery. The bloud burſting our with great force, I fill'd up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with Doſſills dipt in <hi>pulv. ſine pari Jo. Ardern.</hi> with Emplaſter over it: Whilſt I was binding it up, I bethought my ſelf, if by any accident it ſhould chance to burſt out again, the Child might bleed to death before I could have notice; or they might alarm me in the night upon a ſuſpicion of his bleeding, when I ſhould not be ſo provided to reſiſt the Accident as now I was: and withall conſidering, I might at the ſame time ſecure the bleeding, and dry the <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bone, I unbound it, threw out the Doſſills, and applying the actuall Cautery in the place, ſtopt the bleeding, and dried the <hi>Caries.</hi> That done, I dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills dipt in a new-laid Egg, and applied on the Eſcars <hi>unguent. refrigerans Galeni cum empl. è bolo,</hi> with Compreſſe and Bandage dipt in Oxycrate. After which they carried him home. Dr. <hi>Quarterman</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:95669:165"/>was their Phyſician, and preſcribed him Antiſtrumaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ulcer in the Ancle bled no more, nor was that Bone much troubleſome after. We laid open the inſide of the Arm by Cauſtick; and feeling the Bones carious, and the great Artery lying in our way, we cut off that, and by the actuall Cautery dried it; then made way to the other carious Bones, and laid them open. Then cutting open the outſide of the Heel, and ſeeing that extremely rotten, in ſome parts quite through, we opened the other ſide, took part of the Heel-bone out, and dried the remainder with the actuall Cautery, then dreſt the Ulcers with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi</hi> with and without <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> Some of the Bones leſs carious we dreſſed with <hi>extract. ſcordii,</hi> and others with <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> and <hi>pulv. myrrhae,</hi> &amp;c. applying <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over the tender Lips. To the <hi>Ozaena</hi> we uſed Injections of <hi>decoct. hordei cum ſem, cydon.</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>ol. amygd. dule.</hi> to bring off the Cruſts: then with Decoctions of <hi>rad. biſtort. tormentill. rad. ireos, flor. roſ. rub.</hi> and <hi>bacc. myrtill.</hi> decocted in a Chalybeat-water, we dried the Ulceration. To his Lip we uſed a <hi>Fotus</hi> of an emollient Decoction, alſo a <hi>Pomatum</hi> with <hi>arcan. corallinum.</hi> Thus we proceeded with great induſtry: but as ſome Parts cured, others brake out, and the Patient died in a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> after all our Endeavours. Yet that you may not be diſcouraged in giving your aſſiſtance towards the curing theſe ſort of Ulcers with <hi>Caries,</hi> I have here inſerted one Obſervation as it was communicated to me by Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> a Chirurgeon dwelling at <hi>Bridgenorth</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> who was ſometime my Servant.</p>

To which you returned me a long Letter of advice. He had a large hard Tumour in the right <hi>Inguen,</hi> which reached down in ſcirrhous Knots all that Thigh and Leg. He had many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers on that Foot, one whereof paſſed through the Ancle, and rotted part of the <hi>Os naviculare.</hi> There was an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer on his Heel, and another upon the <hi>Tarſus;</hi> in both which the Bones were foul.

                     <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of</hi> Ophthalmia.</head>
                     <p>SOar Eyes are frequently a Species (as I have ſaid) of the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> and take their beginning from vicious Humours inflaming the <hi>Tunica ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> which increaſing doth alſo ſometimes affect the other Tunicles, as the <hi>cornea,</hi> &amp;c. with great pain, tenſion, pulſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence <hi>Puſtulae</hi> ariſe and ſuppurate, terminating for the moſt part in Ulcers, which leave hard <hi>Cicatrices,</hi> and by reaſon of the ſharp Defluxion falling upon the edges of the Eye-lids, do make a Blearedneſs: upon which account theſe Inflammations are generally called <hi>Lippitudo</hi> by the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This differeth from the common <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> in that it is periodicall,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> and is accompanied either with ſtrumous Swellings in the Neck, a thick chapt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip, <hi>Ozaena,</hi> or ſome other Accident.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>King's-Evill;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> yet may it be more particularly imputed to abundance of humidity repleting the Head, and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the weak Eyes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> are apparent by what I have already delivered of the Diſeaſe. Thoſe of the Cauſes are as followeth.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> If the <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> be from Plenitude, the Face is high-coloured, the Eye-lids ſomewhat ſwelled and inflamed, the capillary Veins large and full; yet the Humours are not ſo apt to fret as in other caſes, nor is the pain extremely vehement. If the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be from Choler, the Viſage is not red, but the pain is ſharper, and with Excoriation of the Eye-lids. If the <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> proceed from Pituitous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, all the forementioned Symptoms of Inflammation, pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more remiſs, and the lacrymal Humours are not corroding, unleſs there be a mixture of ſaline Humour joyned with it. Whether an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> may ariſe from Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, I doubt; but if it do, there is ſmall fluxion or pain. That proceeding from the <hi>King's-Evill</hi> is of an acid quality, with ſharp fluxion and pain; the Eye-lids are alſo more apt to be gummed together with a viſcous Humour then they are in thoſe from the other aforeſaid Cauſes. Whether the Humours affecting the Eyes flow from the external or internall Veſſells, may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their complaint. For if they flow from the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> &amp;c. the pain, pulſation, with heat in their Forehead and Temples, will demonſtrate it: but if the contrary, the pain will be more intenſe, and deeper within amongſt the Membranes; there will be alſo an itching in the Palate and Noſtrills, with frequent Sneezing.</p>
                     <p>The Time of the Inflammation ought alſo to be conſidered in order to the Cure, and is thus diſcerned: in the beginning the Eyes look red, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours diſtilling upon them are thin; in the augment, heat and pain increaſe; in the ſtate the accidents of inflammation and pain are great, and the Humours thicken, and do gum the Lids together, eſpecially in the night; in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the fluxion, pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do viſibly diminiſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ophthalmia ſtrumoſa</hi> is of moſt difficult Cure, and in Children very vexatious,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> by reaſon of the humidity they abound with; alſo becauſe of their froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and incapacity of taking proper Remedies, or admitting externall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95669:166"/>and in conſideration of the laxity of their Eyes, they are ſubject to relapſe upon every little diſorder. Thoſe ariſing by conſent from the internall Parts, the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> &amp;c. are incident to more grievous Symptoms then thoſe which proceed from the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and other externall Parts.</p>
                     <p>If in an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> the pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perſevere any long time, there is danger that the Tunicles of the Eye may be corroded: and if the <hi>cornea</hi> happen to have been long ulcerated, a Blindneſs followeth, or at leaſt a Dimneſs of ſight, by reaſon of the condenſation of a groſs Matter about the Pupill.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> their Diet ought to be of Meat of eaſy digeſtion, as hath been ſhewed in the method of Cure of the <hi>Evill,</hi> with great moderation avoiding all ſharp, ſalt, hot or ſpicy meats, and ſuch as may beget Crudities. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe Wine is forbidden. Hydromel is allowed: but in hot bilious Defluxions <hi>decoct. hordei cum tantillo aq. cinnam.</hi> is onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The Air ought to be pure and temperate; that which is windy, duſty or ſmoaky, being offenſive to the Eyes; ſo is Sun-ſhine: therefore we adviſe them to wear ſomewhat of Silk or Linen before their Eyes, commonly a piece of green Sarſenet. Exerciſe of all kind is forbidden, and Quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Sleep is in theſe Diſeaſes neceſſary, when they can get it, the Eyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Quiet the while, which mightily conduces to their Recovery. Their Bodies ought to be kept ſoluble by Clyſters and lenient Purges; ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks being not approved of in Diſeaſes of the Eyes. Yet according to <hi>Hippocrates, Ophthalmiâ laboranti alvi profluvium bonum eſt:</hi> and we ſometimes ſee after a Superpurgation the Fluxion much diminiſhed: but that may rather be imputed to Nature, which ſo disburtheneth her ſelf. In preſcribing to theſe Diſeaſes the Conſtitution muſt be conſidered, and after Purging Anodynes are neceſſary, to quiet the Fermentations raiſed thereby; to which purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>ſyrup. paralyſeos, de papavere erratico, de papavere compoſit.

In the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> and indeed after generall evacuation and diverſion of the Humours, you will find bathing the Body in Water luke-warm of great advantage to contemperate hot and ſharp Humours, if the Seaſon of the year and their Age be capable of it.</p>
                     <p>Derivation is neceſſary in this Diſeaſe; and if there be Inflammation, or that Bloud abound, they may bleed by Lancet in the Arm, Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by Leeches behind the Ears. Shaving the Head, Bliſtering, Cupping, Fontanells and Setons are of frequent uſe: but Fontanells made in the Neck do often cauſe <hi>Strumae</hi> to ariſe thereabouts; therefore Sir <hi>Fra, Prujean,</hi> ſome years before his death, preſcribed them behind the Ears.</p>
                     <p>In the application of externall Remedies to the Eyes, we ought not to be over-forward; for the mildeſt Medicaments dropt into them prove generally offenſive in the beginning of Inflammation: beſides, we ſee in our daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the leſs diſturbances of them go off by generall Evacuation and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that thoſe Eyes have fared worſt which have been moſt treated by Topicks, We may apply Intercipients upon the Temples, of Maſtick, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kamahaca, empl. ad herniam,</hi> &amp;c. Frontalls may alſo be applied of <hi>bol. Armen. ſangu. dracon. balauſt. cum aceto &amp; albumine ovi.</hi> If you judge the Humour to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95669:166"/>flow from the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and externall Parts, you may apply Aſtringents to the Jugulars and round about the Neck. But if the Inflammation be ſudden, and the pain vehement, after Evacuation by lenient Purgatives, or a Clyſter and Venaeſection, you may have recourſe to Anodynes; amongſt which Breaſt-milk and the White of a new-laid egg have precedency, applied externally, or dropt into the Eye. There are Objections made againſt the uſe of them both, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the dropping of Milk into the Eye it may curdle, and by its acrimony offend the Eye: ſo alſo the White of an egg may be its incraſſating quality increaſe the heat in them. To prevent theſe inconveniences, you may mix them with Roſe-water, or uſe them with more caution. In the preparing Medicaments to drop into the Eyes, the Ingredients mixed with the <hi>Collyria</hi> ought to be well waſhed, that they may be without acrimony, and ſo ſubtilly powdered, as that they be not in the leaſt gritty. The Decoctions ought alſo to be cleanly made: and in the dreſſing of the Eyes there ought to be eſpeciall care in cleanſing them and their Lids of viſcous Matter; to which purpoſe an Eye-cup is moſt neceſſary. This being obſerved, you may apply mucilaginous Liquours, or Cataplaſms; for they are good Anodynes. ℞ <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilag. ſem. pſyllii, cydonior. cum aq. roſ. &amp; papaver. extract. extract. an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>camph. croci, an.</hi> gr. vj. <hi>album. ovi, Miſc.</hi> Or, ℞ <hi>medullae panis alb. in lacte &amp; aq. roſ. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceratae, pulpae pomorum dulc. an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>mucilag. ſem. pſyllii &amp; foenugraec. aq. papaver. extract. an.</hi> ℥ſs. <hi>vitell. ovi, camph.</hi> gr. vj. <hi>croci</hi> ℈j. <hi>Miſc.</hi> If pain be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you may add to either of them two grains of Opium, or a <hi>mucilag. ſem. papaver. albi</hi> extracted <hi>cum aq. plantag. roſ.</hi> &amp;c. applied in the form of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> be not accompanied with grievous pain, you ſhall then conſider whether the Diſeaſe be in its beginning, ſtate, or declination, and proportion your Medicaments accordingly. For let the Empiricks boaſt of this or that univerſall <hi>Collyrium,</hi> they cannot cure theſe <hi>Ophthalmiae</hi> with any one particular Medicament: for in the Beginning of Inflammation they require Repellents, and in the increaſe ſomewhat of Reſolvents ought to be mixed with them; in the State they ought to be treated with Reſolvents of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive quality, and in the Declination with Reſolvents and Deterſives of an exſiccant quality. Authours do not all agree of the ſet time when we ſhould begin our Applications to the Eyes; but all of them concur in the proceeding firſt with generall Evacuation and Diverſion of the Humour, and afterwards, ſuppoſe about the third day, to uſe <hi>Collyria.</hi> They ought to be moderately repelling; not too ſtiptick, leſt the Tunicles of the Eyes be thereby dried, and prohibit tranſpiration, and ſo increaſe the pain.</p>
                     <p>We begin with Repellents: of which ſort the ſtrongeſt are the Whites of new-laid eggs beaten to a froth. You ought to apply it to the Eye-lids, the Patient lying upon his Back the while. This is onely proper in the beginning of hot Defluxions. ℞ <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſ.</hi>

                        </note> heretofore ſubject to the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> was the laſt Summer diſtempered with a heat ſcattering over her Head, Face, Neck and Shoulders, which meeting with ſome check returned inward, and affected her Eyes with Inflammation and great Fluxion. Upon notice thereof, I directed a Clyſter of Milk, Sugar, and a little Salt, applied <hi>empl. ad herniam</hi> upon her Temples, and preſcribed the dreſſing her Eyes with Breaſt-milk <hi>cum albumine ovi conquaſſat.</hi> and Cloths to be dipt in the ſame, to lie on all night. The next morning Leeches were applied behind the Ears, and 4 or 5 ounces of bloud was taken away; that day alſo a Clyſter was again repeated, and the Applications to the Eyes continued. The next morning were given her 7 gr. of <hi>Calomel.</hi> with 15 gr. <hi>ſacchar. alb.</hi> which purged her 4 times.

                        </note> having been long diſeaſed with ſoar Eyes, and paſſed through moſt of the Empiricks hands in the Town and Country, came to me, with great Fluxion, <hi>Puſtulae</hi> and <hi>Cicatrices</hi> from former Eruptions. She had alſo ſome ſmall Glands on both ſides of her Neck. I applied Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters upon her Temples to reſiſt the Influx, and made Fontanells behind both her Ears by Cauſticks. I likewiſe fomented her Eyes with a Decoction <hi>ex flor. Sambuci, chamaem. ſtoechad. roſ. rub. &amp; furfuris,</hi> and brought her an Eye-cup, and a <hi>Collyrium</hi> of <hi>ſarcocoll. lap. tutiae &amp; ſacchar. in aqua pomor. dulc.</hi> to waſh her Eyes.

                     <p>A Child aged about 10 years was diſeaſed with a ſharp Defluxion on both her Eyes, with an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> and thick chapt upper Lip.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi>

(It had been made ſixteen days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew of it, and then it was deſcried by the clinging of his Hair to the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:95669:168"/>Plaiſter. From that time he grew froward with it, and in compliance with him it was healed up again 2 or 3 months after.)

So often as I deſigned larger Evacuation, I mixed a purging Syrup with the Rhubarb-drink: and the following night preſcribed him a ſpoonfull of the anodyne Syrup in Mace-ale, or what elſe he beſt reliſht. A Pearl-julep was made him of a diſtill'd Milk, <hi>cum aq. cinnam. hordeat. &amp; ſacchar. alb.</hi> alſo a medicated Ale was preſcribed him of <hi>ſarſaparill. lign. lentiſc. ſantal. alb. paſſul. maj. enucleat. flor. ſalviae, beton. euphraſiae, milleped. cort. citr. &amp; nuc. moſchat.</hi> He was extreme nice in taking any thing of Phyſick, ſo was for the moſt part cheated into it.

Sometimes in extremity of pain in his Eyes Stupes were applied to them wrung out of a <hi>decoct. flor. ſambuci, cham. roſ. rub.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Collyria</hi> were more rarely applied: thoſe that were uſed were <hi>aq. pomor. dulc.</hi> and ſometimes other diſtill'd Waters wherein had been infuſed <hi>troch. alb.

He was frequently well three or four months together, and at length hath in a great meaſure worn off the many Diſturbances; yet, being of a tender Conſtitution, may be incident to Defluxion upon his Eyes: but he hath been hitherto certainly relieved, as I ſaid, by the foreſaid Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

After I had thus extirpated the overgrown Fleſh, I clipt off the looſe Sloughs, and with a Sponge in a Baſon of water I waſhed the lixiviall Salts out of the Eſcar, dropping into his Eye <hi>mucilag. ex ſem. althaeae, pſyllii &amp; cydonior.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted <hi>in aq. plantag.</hi> then laying him upon his Back, I covered over the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall parts with Whites of eggs beaten with a piece of Alume to a Froth, and thereby reſtrained the Fluxion. After the Eſcar ſeparated, I rubb'd the remaining Superexcreſcence with a Vitriol-ſtone, waſhing the Salts out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with fair Water. During this work he was let bloud, and frequently waſht his Eye with a Solution of <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſis</hi> and <hi>aq. plantag. &amp; ſolani.</hi> Thus in the ſpace of 3 months it was extirpated and cured, the Eye-lid retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning naturally as the other.</p>

                        </note> having been afflicted from his infancy with ſoar Eyes, conſulted Sr. <hi>Fra. Prujean,</hi> who ſent for me. The Patient had a certain Blearedneſs of both the left Eye-lids from the externall <hi>Canthus</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but more eſpecially on the lower Lid; which Blearedneſs was covered with ſmall white branny Scales inveſting the Hair.

                     <head>CHAP. VI. Of <hi>Aegilops.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>AEGilops</hi> is a Tubercle in the inner <hi>Canthus</hi> of the Eye, either Scrophulous, Atheromatous, or of the nature of a <hi>Meliceris,</hi> or ſometime with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation. It hath obtained two names amongſt the <hi>Grecians:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Names.</note> viz. <hi>Anchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops,</hi> when it is not ulcerated; <hi>Aegilops,</hi> when it is. In which latter caſe it is very apt to grow ſinuous; and being ſo, whether it prove callous or not, is however called <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis,</hi> ſometimes paſſing through the Bone of the Noſe it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Aegilops</hi> are the ſame that produce the like Tumours in other places.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> But in ſome caſes it is made by Fluxion, and appeareth firſt as a ſmall <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> This Diſeaſe frequently occurreth in <hi>Lues Venerea:</hi> but theſe I here treat of are Strumous.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>Struma Atheroma,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs.</note> &amp;c. it is then made by Congeſtion, and the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle is round, without diſcolouring the Skin. If it be made by Fluxion, pain and redneſs do appear, with Inflammation over all that Eye. Sometimes it beginneth onely with a weeping of that corner, and is not diſcovered till it affects the Eye with redneſs; and then, by preſſure with your finger upon that <hi>Canthus,</hi> a mixt Matter may be diſcharged, part whereof is not unlike the White of an egg. Sometimes this Matter eateth quite through the Bone, and diſchargeth it ſelf downwards through the Noſe with a foetid ſmell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiſtulae lacrymales</hi> are difficult of Cure from what Cauſe ſoever they ariſe.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> The Part being looſe and ſpongy, the Eye very ſenſible, and the laxity of the Part, maketh Humours apt to ſoak into it, and to penetrate even to the Bone it ſelf. The ſenſibleneſs of the Eye renders it ſubject to pain and fluxion, as alſo unfit to be dreſſed with ſharp Medicaments, ſuch as theſe Diſeaſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Fiſtula</hi> which is recent, with ſufficient opening is the eaſieſt of Cure. Thoſe of a long continuance are for the moſt part accompanied with Ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gland, and <hi>Caries</hi> in the Bone, which makes them ſubject to a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after they are cured. If the Ulcer be accompanied with Eroſion, it will be apt to terminate cancerous; in which caſe the Cure is deplorable.</p>
                     <p>The indication of <hi>Cure</hi> is taken from the condition of the <hi>Aegilops,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> whether it be in its beginning with Inflammation, or by Congeſtion, paſſing its Matter forth under the <hi>Cilium</hi> into the Eye: in which caſe it is fiſtulated. <hi>Anchylops</hi> hath alſo its peculiar way of treating, as other Tumours of the Glands.</p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:95669:170"/>
                     <p>In the beginning of <hi>Aegilops</hi> Bleeding by Lancet is neceſſary, and ſo is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, alſo ſuch Alteratives as have been preſcribed in the generall Cure of <hi>Strumae,</hi> with regulation of Diet accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Externally we apply Repellents to the diſeaſed Part, to prevent Fluxion, of <hi>aqua portulac. lactucae, plantag. equiſeti, ſolani, ſperm. ranar.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. ovor. bolo Armen.</hi> &amp;c. To intercept the Matter we apply <hi>gum. maſtich. takamahaca, emplaſt. ad herniam,</hi> to the Temples and Parts about. If the Tumour increaſe with tenſion and pain, it will then be reaſonable to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Diſcuſſion by Medicaments already deſcribed in <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> of <hi>ſummitat. abſinth. flor. ſambuci, rutae, far. lentium, orobi,</hi> &amp;c. decocted in Wine or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lixive. In the <hi>Anchylops</hi> rancid Nuts beaten and applied are much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: ſo likewiſe is <hi>calx viva cum melle contrita.</hi> If the Tumour tend to Suppuration, then haſten Concoction <hi>cum radic. lilior. mucilag. ſem. althaeae, foenugraeci, lini, far. tritic. axung. porcin.</hi> &amp;c. The Matter being well concocted, lay it open large, that you may have way to apply your Medicaments. Authours have propoſed various Eſcaroticks to open theſe; but I uſe the opening them by Knife or Cauſtick. The onely Caution is, that you open it ſuch a diſtance off from the edge of the Eye-lid, that you divide not that: for in ſo doing you will leave a remedileſs Blemiſh, and the Eye will be apt to water ever after, and be ſubject to Fluxion. Therefore if you open it by Cauſtick, it will require your greater care. I for the moſt part open them by Inciſion. Then digeſt them with a Doſſill dipt <hi>in oleo roſ. &amp; vitell. ovi;</hi> over which apply <hi>cerat. Galeni,</hi> or ſuch like Anodynes, with a Compreſſe dipt in ſome of the aboveſaid diſtill'd Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to contemperate the heat in the Part; and afterwards deterge with <hi>mel roſ. ſyr de roſ. ſiccis;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>mell. comm.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>viridis aeris</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantur ad tertiae partis conſumptionem:</hi> and then diſpoſe them to cicatrize with this; ℞ <hi>myrobalan. citr.</hi>

                     <p>If it be Fiſtulous, and the Orifice ſmall, dilate it with Gentian-roots, or ſuch like, and proceed with Deterſives, as hath been ſaid. If thereby the <hi>Callus</hi> do not waſte, you may inject this following Decoction; ℞ <hi>fol. rutae, chelidon. min. agrimon. an.</hi> Mſs. <hi>infund. per noctem ſpir. vini</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr> ſs. <hi>coletur pro uſu:</hi> and apply this following upon Doſſills; ℞ <hi>zinziberis</hi>

                     <p>In the applying them the Parts about muſt be well defended, and the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſtrained by the application of Refrigerants; and after all it is a moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tedious way. Therefore I propoſe the uſe of the actuall Cautery; which being applied through a <hi>Cannula</hi> will with one touch waſte the Calloſity and <hi>Caries:</hi> after which dreſs it up with a Doſſill dipt in a mixture of <hi>ol. roſ. cum albumine ovi,</hi> and a Compreſſe in the ſame over all: then digeſt and deterge with the milder Preſcriptions, keeping the Orifice dilated with a Doſſill dipt in <hi>tinctura myrrhae,</hi> &amp;c. till the Bone exfoliate: then with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. with Compreſſion cicatrize.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Anchylops</hi> requires Extirpation, and is to be cured accordingly to what is propoſed in this Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>A Young Gentlewoman, abounding with acid <hi>Serum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Aegilops</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</note> was ſeized with an Inflammation and Tumour in the great <hi>Canthus</hi> or Angle of her Eye.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95669:171"/>She had been dreſſed by ſome neighbouring Friend till the Inflammation cloſed up her Eye-lid, and alarm'd her by the great diſcharge of a mixt ferous Matter I, obſerving the Tumour perfectly ſuppurated, and the Matter ſhining under the <hi>Cuticula</hi> ready to burſt through, open'd it by the point of a Lancet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing one drop of bloud. The Matter diſcharged, I dreſſed it with a Doſſill dipt <hi>in vitello ovi,</hi> with a Plaiſter of <hi>cerat. Galeni,</hi> and Cloaths dipt in Red wine over all, with convenient Bandage to retain them on. The next day I took off Dreſſings, and fomented it with <hi>decoct. fol. malv. viol. betonic. ſalviae, &amp; flor. roſ. rub.</hi> in Wine and Water, repeating the Dreſſings as before, and let her bloud in the Arm. At the next day's dreſſing I found the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her Eye-lid relaxed, and the externall Inflammation mitigated, but the Eye it ſelf inflamed. I fomented and dreſſed the Abſceſſe with a Doſſill dipt in <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> applying a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. tutiae</hi> over it, with a ſoft Compreſſe thereupon; leaving the Eye at liberty to be refreſhed by the Air, and to be dreſſed with Breaſt-milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they pleaſed. To the Forehead Frontlets were applied to reſtrain and intercept the Influx. Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> was her Phyſician, and preſcribed her lenient Purgatives, traumatick Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I alſo kept the Orifice open ſufficiently for diſcharge of the Matter and conveniency of dreſſing, applying externally refrigerant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccant Medicaments, and adding a few drops of <hi>tinctura viridis</hi> to the Syrup in which I dipt my Doſſills. Yet notwithſtanding our endeavours, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having made its paſſage into the Eye during the time of Suppuration, it continued its courſe, and flowed both ways in too great a quantity for ſome time. Upon which conſideration I dreſſed the Ulcer with a Doſſill dipt in Praecipitate, and applied over it a Pledgit <hi>cum unguent. tutiae Vigonis,</hi> with Compreſſe and Bandage. After I had thus digeſted it, I dreſſed it with a Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill dipt <hi>in aq. viridis,</hi> (as it is preſcribed in the method of Cure,) leſſening the ſaid Doſſill daily, and at laſt cicatrized it firm.</p>
                     <p>A ſcrophulous Child of about 4 years of age having an inflamed Tubercle in the great Angle of her left Eye,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Aegilops</hi> with Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> the Matter being ſuppurated, I opened it by Inciſion, and diſcharged a well-concocted Matter; then fomented the Tumour with Wine, and fill'd the Abſceſſe with Doſſils dipt <hi>in ſyr. de roſ. ſicc.</hi> with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> over it, alſo a Plaiſter of <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> over that, and bound it up, proceeding daily in the fomenting and dreſſing it, till the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Swelling remitted. After which I added a few drops of <hi>tinctura viridis</hi> to the Syrup, and kept the Ulcer dilated with a Doſſill dipt and preſſed out of that Mixture, applying a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. ex lap. calamin.</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and Bandage over it. And the better to diſpoſe the Ulcer to cure, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her once in 4 or 5 days with an Infuſion of Rhubarb in Small beer, and once aweek with a few grains of <hi>Merc. dulc. cum ſaccharo.</hi> The Matter dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, I leſſened the Doſſill, and cicatrized it with the aforeſaid Tincture, making good Bandage upon the <hi>Sinus</hi> till it was cloſe united, and ceaſed weeping.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about 25 years of age having been between 3 and 4 years ſubject to the <hi>King's-Evill</hi> and a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> weeping into the Eye from the great <hi>Canthus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis.</hi>
                        </note> I preſcribed her <hi>aq. lap. medicament. Crollii</hi> to drop into that corner of her Eye, and directed her the making a conſtant Compreſſion upon the externall Parts by an Inſtrument made to that purpoſe: by which ſhe was in few months cured. And by the ſame way, with the help of Internalls, I have cured many of thoſe, where the Bone hath not been carious, or the Habit of body extremely indiſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>A Boy about 7 or 8 years of age,<note place="margin">4 Obſervat. of <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis.</hi>
                        </note> of a very ill Habit of body, had alſo been two years diſeaſed with a <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis,</hi> and conſulted ſome of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95669:171"/>But they deterred him and his Parents with the mention of the actuall Cautery: whereupon he was put into my hands to cure. I made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion into the Cavity, and put into it a proportionable piece of Gentian-root, with a Pledgit of <hi>Baſilicon</hi> over it, and a Compreſſe preſſed out of ſome of the aforementioned diſtill'd Waters. The ſecond day after I repeated the ſame manner of dreſſing, and continued to keep it dilated with ſome of the ſame Roots. During which I endeavoured to reſtrain the influx of Humours, and dry up thoſe affecting the Part, according as hath been ſet down in the method of Cure, and by Antiſtrumaticks diſpoſed the Humours to a healing condition. The Fluxion being thus removed, and the Matter little, I left off the uſe of the Gentian-root, and dreſſed the Ulcer with Doſſils dipt and preſſed out of <hi>aq. med. Crollii,</hi> and after ſome days leſſened them daily. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I left off the Doſſills, and cicatrized the Ulcer with Pledgits of <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. Many ſuch I have ſo cured: but ſome years after I have ſeen divers of them thus cured weeping again.</p>
                     <p>A Girl of about 12 years of age having a <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis</hi> of ſome years continuance, diſcharging a mixt crude Matter daily into the Eye,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis.</hi>
                        </note> I laid it open by Inciſion, dilated and digeſted it, and endeavoured by Internalls to diſpoſe the Body to a better habit, and proſecuted the Cure by Exſiccants. But it not yielding thereto, I ſeparated the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> from the Bone, made Exfoliation of it, and incarned upon that, ſuppoſing I had by Compreſſion cicatrized the Ulcer. But it brake out again upon the leaving off the Bandage; upon which I dilated it again, and by actuall Cautery conſumed the <hi>Callus</hi> and Bone: after which it cured more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged about 38 years had a <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis</hi> diſcharging its Matter into the Eye in great quantity.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis.</hi>
                        </note> I applied a ſmall Cauſtick upon that part of it where I felt the Cavity; and having eaten into it, I paſſed an actuall Cautery through it to the Bone, whereby I cauterized it, then dreſſed the burnt Eſcar with Lenients to haſten its Separation, and afterwards deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cicatrized the Ulcer as hath been afore ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>A Young fellow, aged 28 years, was commended to me out of the City,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis.</hi>
                        </note> having a <hi>Fiſtula lacrymalis</hi> diſcharging a great quantity of purulent Matter into the Eye. He had ſuffered many years by it, and paſſed through many hands unſucceſsfully. I laid it open by Inciſion, and dilated it, endeavouring ſome while to digeſt it, and to that purpoſe preſcribed various Internalls: but the Matter rather increaſing, I paſſed a <hi>Cannula</hi> into the Cavity, and with an actuall Cautery pierced through that ſide of the Bone of the Noſe, thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Matter, and afterwards cured the Ulcer with more eaſe; the Bone alſo exfoliated, and fill'd up with <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could give you more Inſtances of the Cures of <hi>Fiſtulae lacrymales:</hi> but the manner thereof differeth not from what hath before been ſaid; and by the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cautery I never failed in the Cure of the worſt of them.</p>
                     <p>A Woman aged about 30 years having a Tubercle in the great <hi>Canthus</hi> of the right Eye of the bigneſs of a Piſtol-bullet, I made Inciſion of the Skin,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of <hi>Anchylops.</hi>
                        </note> and ſeparating it from the preternaturall body, I raiſed it up. In taking it out, the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> broke, and ſhewed it ſelf by its Matter to be a <hi>Meliceris.</hi> I cleanſed the Wound, and cut it out, bringing away the <hi>Cyſtis;</hi> then cloſed up the Lips of the Wound, and applied a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> with Bandage over it, and cured it by Agglutination. Theſe Tubercles do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield to Diſcutients: and ſome times, after they have reſiſted all our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, they have of themſelves reſolved. Particularly I ſaw it in an Enſign in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> who was troubled with a Tubercle of the bigneſs of a Pigeon's egg, which had been of many years continuance. He intended to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95669:172"/>have been my Patient there, and ſome years after deſigned to have put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my hands here: but a while after it diſſipated ſo as there remained no mark of it.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman came to <hi>London</hi> recommended to me having a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle in the great Angle of her right Eye,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of <hi>Anchylops.</hi>
                        </note> of the bigneſs of a Lupin. Many endeavours had been uſed in the Country to reſolve it. I began with Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, Bleeding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thought I had thereby diſſipated the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but after a few days diſcontinuance of Topicks and Bandage, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again: upon ſight whereof I opened it by Inciſion, and diſcharged a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like the White of an egg. I could not perceive any <hi>Cyſtis,</hi> yet judged it an <hi>Atheroma.</hi> Having dreſſed it with a Doſſill dipt in Praecipitate, I applied another over it ſpred with <hi>baſilicon,</hi> with a Compreſſe over that dipt <hi>in aq. roſ. rub. &amp; ſolani.</hi> The third day I repeated the ſame kind of Dreſſings, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued them till I had well deterged and digeſted the Ulcer; then dreſſed it with a Doſſill dipt in a Sarcotick tincture of Myrrh, Aloes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with Epuloticks, and thought it had been cicatrized. But preſſing with my finger one day upon the upper part of it, and a diſproportionate quantity of Matter flowing forth, I paſſed in my Probe, and feeling the Bone carious, I dilated it with Gentian-roots, paſſed in a <hi>Cannula</hi> to the <hi>Caries,</hi> and with an actuall Cautery dried the Bone. I applied to it <hi>ol. roſ. cum albumine ovi;</hi> and afterwards dreſſed the Ulcer daily for the firſt 4 or 5 days with Doſſils dipt in <hi>decoct. hordei, rad. conſolid. maj.</hi> and when the anguiſh was mitigated, with <hi>tinctura myrrhae,</hi> keeping the Orifice open till the Exfoliation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; then cicatrized it, as hath been ſhewed in the former Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>A poor Woman came to me out of the Country with a large Tubercle on the right <hi>Canthus:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">10. Obſervat. of <hi>Anchylops</hi> with a <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
                        </note> ſhe had alſo a <hi>Polypus</hi> in that Noſtrill. I began with the Tubercle by the application of a Cauſtick. After the ſeparation of which a <hi>Fungus</hi> thruſt forth, and grew very vexatious in the eradicating. After I had ſpent ſome time unſucceſsfully in the work, I began with the <hi>Polypus,</hi> attempting to thruſt it out with my finger: but it not yielding that way, I took hold of it with a <hi>Forceps</hi> Ducks bills, and having pulled it outward, I paſſed a Needle with a twiſted brown Thread through it, according to <hi>Fab. ab Aquapend.</hi> and pulling by that and my <hi>Forceps</hi> together, it came away about the length of two inches, but was attended with a flux of bloud from the Noſe, Mouth and Eye; which was ſtopt by the ſyringing up of Oxycrate. At the next dreſſing of the Ulcer in the <hi>Canthus</hi> I miſſed the <hi>Fungus, ,</hi> and found a great hole in the Bone of the Noſe. Upon ſight of which I concluded the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> which had been there was the root of that <hi>Polypus.</hi> The Bone was much corrupted: but I haſtened the externall Cure of the Ulcer, and return'd her into the Country, leaving the Exfoliation of the Bone to Nature.</p>
                     <p>Having treated accidentally of a <hi>Polypus,</hi> I thought my ſelf obliged to give you one Obſervation of an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> it being an Ulcer within the Noſe; and though it be not the <hi>King's-Evill,</hi> yet it too frequently accompanieth it, and is occaſioned by thoſe ſharp Humours paſſing that way, and yieldeth not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to Cure then by the generall method preſcribed in this Treatiſe.</p>

And by this method all theſe kind of <hi>Ozaenae</hi> may be cured.</p>
                     <p>The Eye-lids are frequently diſeaſed with glandulous Tubercles; which, how different Matter ſoever they contain, are generally called <hi>Hordeoli,</hi> and do take their originall from the ſame Marter that thoſe Tumours do which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this Treatiſe of <hi>Strumae,</hi> and are cured after the ſame manner. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they reſolve or ſuppurate: but for the moſt part they are taken out by Knife or Cauſtick. Theſe onely that lie between the inner Tunicle and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilage are capable of being extirpated by Inciſion: the other may be eradicated by Cauſtick; the manner I ſhall ſhew you in a few Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 26 years of age had an <hi>Hordeolum</hi> on his right Eye-lid, lying between the externall Tunicle and Cartilage.<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of <hi>Hordeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
                        </note> I applied <hi>emplaſtrum ad ſtrumas</hi> on it, with hopes of reſolving it: but after ſome time it ſuppurated. I thereupon opened it with a Lancet, and let out the Matter; then digeſted it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> But feeling afterward ſome part of the Gland in it, I ſprinkled into it ſome <hi>Merc. praecipit.</hi> and applied a Pledgit of <hi>baſilicon</hi> over it, with <hi>emplaſtr. diachyl. ſimpl.</hi> whereby I eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and ſoon after healed it ſmooth with <hi>unguent. tutiae.</hi> Where the Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath been more perfect, they are eaſier cured. In others, where they were hard and movable, I have opened them by Inciſion tranſverſe, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the length of the Eye-lid, and thruſt them out whole, then healed them by Agglutination. Yet in ſome of theſe the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> hath burſt in taking out, and a thick curdled matter hath thruſt forth: in which caſes I digeſted them out with Praecipitate, and healed them as aforeſaid. But the opening theſe with a Cauſtick-ſtone pointed is moſt gratefull, to Women at leaſt: upon which conſideration I generally open them that way, and upon ſeparation of the Eſcar thruſt them out, and cure them by Digeſtion with little trouble or pain.</p>
                     <p>A young Woman came out of the North-country to me with an <hi>Hordeolum</hi> on the inſide of the Cartilage preſſing upon the Eye with great weight,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of <hi>Hordeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
                        </note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming it. I turned the Lid inſide outward, made an Inciſion into it, and thruſt it out: then cleanſing the Wound, I returned the Lid down. It cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it ſelf in three or four days, without any manner of dreſſing. Yet ſometimes Excreſcences thruſt out there, and inflame the Eye. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95669:173"/>I have ſeen Excreſcences of ſoft Fleſh grow upon the <hi>Tunica conjunctiva,</hi> and cauſe an Inflammation of the Eye. Severall ſuch like have come to me out of the Country: ſome I have cut away with Sciſſors; others I have worn off with the Alume and Vitriol-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of <hi>Sarcoma</hi> upon the <hi>Supercilia.</hi>
                        </note> aged 29 years, was commended into my hands by Sr. <hi>Edward Alſton</hi> Phyſician. She was diſeaſed with a Tumour of a dark red colour poſſeſſing the upper Lid of her left Eye between the externall Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle and the Cartilage, ſpreading to the very edge of the <hi>Cilium.</hi> It took its originall from ſome <hi>Hordeolum</hi> ill handled, and ſeemed to be a <hi>Sarcoma.</hi> I propoſed the eradicating it by Eſcarotick: which being allowed of, I encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Tumour with Ink, then began with a Cauſtick-ſtone in the upper part of it, wiping up the diſſolved Salt with armed Probes, proceeding gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the work to the very edge of the Lid, with great care to preſerve the Hair growing on it. It was a very nice work. After I had ſufficiently pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated into this Fleſhy body, I waſhed the Salts out of the Eſcar, and ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying it, dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum oleo lilior.</hi> and bound it up. The next day we met again; when I took off Dreſſings, and found the Tumour flat, the Eſcar lying proportionably as was deſigned, and the Eye undiſturbed. I fomented <hi>cum decoct. malvae, viol.</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed it up as before, continuing my attendance daily with her Phyſician: and as the Eſcar ſeparated between the Scarifications, I either rubb'd the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcreſcence of Fleſh with the Vitriol-ſtone, or ſprinkled it with Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, or uſed both. And after the Eſcar caſt off, I deterged and waſted the remaining <hi>baſis,</hi> and cicatrized it ſmooth, leaving the very Edge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſhaped, without loſſe of one Hair: and ſo it continueth to this day.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman was brought to me by Sr. <hi>Theod. de Vo.</hi> who had a large Excreſcence in the great Angle of his right Eye.<note place="margin">15.

I paſſed a Ligature upon the <hi>baſis</hi> of it, and clipt it off cloſe: then drying up the bloud with a Sponge dipt in <hi>aq. ſperm. ranar.</hi> I rubb'd its remaining <hi>baſis</hi> with the Vitriol-ſtone, then waſhed his Eye again with the foreſaid <hi>aq. ſp. ranar.</hi> The next morning I viſited him, and met his Phyſician there; but we ſaw nothing of the Excreſcence remaining, neither did it appear any more.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the</hi> Tonſills.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Tonſills,</hi> or Almonds of the Ears, are alſo frequently ſwelled in the <hi>King's-Evill:</hi> which Tumour may be very well reckoned a Species of it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Swellings are raiſed by Congeſtion gradually without pain, and therefore are ſeldome taken notice of till by their growth they bring inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences with them, as Catarrh, Cough, or Difficulty of ſwallowing: in which latter caſe their Drink often runneth out at their Noſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe differ from the common Swellings of the <hi>Amygdalae,</hi> as Tumours by Congeſtion do from thoſe made by Fluxion: which latter are of ſudden growth,<note place="margin">Difference.</note> and terminate as ſoon; whereas the other may have been many years growing, and do increaſe and decreaſe with the Moon, as generally all Tumours by Congeſtion in the Glands do.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Tumefaction of theſe Glands are the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Strumae.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cauſes.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are ſoft fleſhy Tumours, of a round or ovall figure, retaining the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall colour of the Skin; and are of an obtuſe ſenſe,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> ſo that you may pierce the body of them with a Knife or Probe without cauſing pain or drawing bloud: yet are they ſubject to Inflammation, and the like Accidents that other Swellings of the Glands are.</p>
                     <p>If the Tumefaction be ſmall, the diſturbance is little; many people having had them from their Infancy without great inconvenience.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> If the Swellings be big, there may be danger of Suffocation: but in that caſe they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated without running any great hazzard.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure,</hi> Phyſicians do generally preſcribe Venaeſection, and by Clyſters and lenient Purgatives make Evacuation; alſo by Bliſtering, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> Fontanells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they endeavour Derivation: which is neceſſary in caſe of Inflammation; in which aſtringent Lotions may be alſo proper. But in thoſe made by Congeſtion the ſpeedieſt way of Cure is by Extirpation: and that either by Abſciſſion, at once cutting them off; or by actuall or potentiall Cautery. Modern Writers have ſaid little of theſe Extirpations. <hi>Fabritius ab Aquapend.</hi> in his Book <hi>De operat. Chirurg.</hi> renders the Abſciſſion of them difficult enough, and not without danger; as you may ſee, where delivering <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi>'s way of cutting them out, he determins at laſt thus, <hi>Ex qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus licet colligere, neque facilem neque omnino tutam hanc Chirurgiam eſſe,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt Chirurgeon in my memory that attempted the Extirpating them was the late deceaſed Mr. <hi>Ed. Mol.</hi> an excellent Operator. He attempted it upon a Perſon of Honour by actuall Cautery through a <hi>Cannula</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for that purpoſe. I afterwards ſaw him burn ſeverall. He paſſed the Cautery through the body of them, and by repeating of it twice or thrice he burnt a hole through them, and accordingly crimpled them up; as may be yet ſeen in that Noble Perſon, ſomewhat of the Excreſcence ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and not without ſome uneaſineſſe at certain times: upon which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95669:174"/>account I had the honour to ſee it ſome years ſince. The way by potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cautery is, by working with a Cauſtick-ſtone and other Eſcaroticks fixt in ſuch an Inſtrument as may ſerve to eat into them, without offending the neighbouring ſound Parts. To which purpoſe I make my way into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Gland, conſuming it within; and at laſt the Shell (or exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts) falls in pieces, and is ſo eradicated. The way by Exciſion is, by making a Ligature about the <hi>baſis</hi> of them, and ſnipping them cloſe off with a pair of crooked Probe-ſciſſors. In this work you ought to conſider well how they are radicated. For ſometimes they are rooted like a <hi>Criſta</hi> deeper in the Throat: in which, if in cutting them out you onely cut that part you tied, and cut the Ligature at the ſame time, it will ſlip down into the Throat, and hazzard their choaking. Therefore whilſt you hold the Ligature with one hand, you muſt paſs the Sciſſors down as cloſe by the <hi>baſis</hi> of it as you can, ſo as by one ſnip you may cut it clear off. But leſt you ſhould fail, it will be neceſſary to have another Ligature fitted in an Inſtrument for your purpoſe, and the Patient's Head to be held ſteady, that in caſe you fail in the firſt attempt, and it fall into the Throat, you may readily return it, and tie it at the ſame time; which is no difficult thing to doe. The Exciſion made, the bleeding will be ſoon ſtopt by Gargling with Oxycrate; and you may cicatrize it in a few days by touching it with the Vitriol and Alume-ſtones. I ſhall give you ſome Inſtances of my practice therein, and ſhew you my firſt attempt in the Extirpation of them by Eſcarotick and Exciſion in this following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of both the Tonſills.</note> aged 10 years, having been ſome years diſeaſed with preternaturall Swellings in her Tonſills, with great Defluxion upon her Lungs, alſo Difficulty of breathing, and at laſt of ſwallowing, her Drink frequently running out at her Noſe, was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and put into the hands of Sr. <hi>Fra. Prujean</hi> and Dr. <hi>Luke Rugely.</hi> Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> was Chirurgeon to the Family. Various Remedies had been preſcribed: but they proving ineffectuall to remove them, I was conſulted, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Extirpation of them by actuall Cautery. But that not being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I undertook it by Eſcaroticks, and came the next day prepared, and placed her in a clear light, her Head leaning to a Bed-poſt, Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> ſitting behind, holding it ſteady. I began with the left Tonſill, holding her Tongue down with a <hi>Speculum linguae,</hi> while I preſſed into the body of the Tumour with a long-pointed Cauſtick-ſtone fixed to a Stick. After I had held it a while, I pull'd it out, and with a Firre-ſtick dipt <hi>in oleo vitrioli</hi> preſſed into the ſame place, then pulled out that too, and gave her a Glaſs of water to waſh her Mouth. I repeated the uſe of the ſeverall Cauſticks; ſhe waſhing her Mouth always after the uſe of them. By this method I pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into both the Tonſills, and divided the left into two. In the time of working with the Cauſtick, I dried up the Salts of them with armed Probes ſo well, that her Mouth was not fretted in any part by them: and after I had finiſht the work, I waſht the Tonſills with <hi>decoct. hordei,</hi> and ſhe afterwards gargled with a pleaſant Julep made of diſtill'd Water, <hi>acet. roſ.</hi> and <hi>ſyr. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moron.</hi> Having divided the one Tonſill, and diminiſhed the other, I cauſed an Inſtrument to be made to convey a Ligature about the <hi>baſis</hi> of them, with deſign to tie and cut them off one after another. I began with the left Tonſill, paſſing a Ligature upon the one half, and cut it off cloſe. There happening no diſturbance by bleeding, I tied the other, and cut it off: then with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioll-ſtone I rubb'd the remaining <hi>baſis,</hi> and thereby ſmoothed and cicatrized it in 4 or 5 days. I then began with the right Tonſill. Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> holding
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95669:174"/>her Head as formerly, I made a Ligature upon the <hi>baſis</hi> of it, and holding the end of it with my right hand, I paſſed a pair of Probe-ſciſſors with my other hand cloſe by the ſaid <hi>baſis,</hi> and ſuppoſing I had encompaſſed the root, I clipt; but it not coming away, I thruſt my Sciſſors downwards, and cut again, being confident I had clipt through the fleſhy body. I pull'd the Ligature, but it not coming, I was ſomewhat ſurprized what ſhould be the cauſe: therefore pulling my Sciſſors a little back, and turning them more off from the <hi>baſis,</hi> I clipt again, cut off the bigger part of it, and brought it out with my Ligature: at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe choaked. The Ladies ſeeing it ſhrieked, and became troubleſome. I deſired Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> to ſit ſtill while the Patient choaked: ſhe gaping, I paſſed into her Throat the Inſtrument I had made the Ligature by, and raiſing up the remaining Excreſcence, ſhe recovered, and cried, Shall I live? I replied, Yes, if you ſit ſtill. I paſſed another Inſtrument fitted with a Ligature. In changing the Inſtruments the Excreſcence ſlipt down, and ſhe choaked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but I raiſed it up, and relieved her: then tied the Ligature upon it, and looked into her Throat; where I ſaw it rooted like a Cock's Combe, and that in endeavouring to cut the Tonſill cloſe by the root, I had cut below the part I had tied. Which if I could have foreſeen, and have paſſed my Sciſſors cloſe a little lower, one Snip had brought it clear away: but not ſuppoſing it rooted ſo low, and working blind-fold, I was at a loſſe. But being now better informed, I paſſed my crooked Probe-ſciſſors down lower, cut it clean off by the roots; and brought it away with my Ligature. I cicatrized it with the Vitriol and Alume-ſtones in few days. Yet ſome while after ſhe was cured, a part of her Drink came out at her Noſe: which happened by reaſon of the Tonſils drawing that part of her Palate down lower then naturally it ſhould: and I ſuppoſe that was the cauſe of her ſpeaking ſo. But ſome while after ſhe was freed of thoſe Inconveniences.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman aged 25 years, who had been long ſubject to Defluxions,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of the right Tonſill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from overgrown Tonſills, and taken much Phyſick unſucceſsfully, was recommended to me. The right Tonſill being very large, I propoſed the cutting it off. The Patient's Friends conſulted their Phyſician and Chirurgeon: they did not readily aſſent to it. But notwithſtanding, the Patient and his Friends perceiving there was no other way of Cure, they recommended him again to my care. I made a Ligature upon it, with deſign to have cut it off at that inſtant: but obſerving their great apprehenſions of a Flux of bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deferred it till the next morning, and then I ſaw it ſhrunk and much leſſened. I took hold of the Ligature with one hand, and paſſing my Probe-ſciſſors cloſe by the root of it, at one Snip cut it off, and brought it away with the Ligature, it ſcarce bleeding one jot. I rubb'd the remaining <hi>baſis</hi> with a Vitriol-ſtone, and cauſed him afterwards to gargle with <hi>decoct. hordet cum ſyr. de roſis ſiccis,</hi> and in 4 or 5 days cicatrized it. The other being ſmall, I deferred the meddling with it till there ſhould appear more cauſe. But from that time he recovered a better health.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman's Daughter of about twelve years of age,<note place="margin">3.

Looking in her Throat, and ſeeing her Tonſills, eſpecially the right, very big, I adviſed the cutting off the bigger. To which they aſſenting, I made a Ligature upon it, and at the ſame inſtant cut it off; and afterwards, by rubbing it with the Vitriol-ſtone, cicatrized it in few days. She being relieved hereby, hath hitherto deferred the outting off the other.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman of about 26 years of age, ſubject to Catarrhs,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of both the Tonſills ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated.</note> by reaſon of the preternaturall growth of the <hi>Amygdalae</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and conſulted her
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:95669:175"/>Phyſician. He adviſed her to have them cut off, and brought me to her. I made a Ligature upon the one, and cut it off, waſhing her Mouth after with Oxycrate: then paſſed a Ligature upon the other, and cut it alſo off; ſhe gargled and waſht her Mouth. I afterwards rubb'd the <hi>baſis</hi> of them with a Vitriol-ſtone, and took my leave for that time. The next day I came again, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to dreſſe the remaining Wounds: but ſhe was removed from her Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, or her Phyſician had undertaken the cicatrizing them; for from that time I neither ſaw nor heard from her.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged 56 years had been a long while ſubject to Defluxions upon her Throat and Breaſt.<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of the left Tonſill. extirpated.</note> After various Endeavours to divert this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour I was conſulted. Looking into her Mouth, I ſaw the left Tonſill very large, and ſuppoſed that the cauſe of her Catarrh. I propoſed the Exciſion of it: which being approved of, I came the next day, and made a Ligature about its root, and with my Probe-ſciſſors cut through it, as was accuſtomed. But it not coming away as it ſhould, and the bloud flowing down her Throat whilſt ſhe leaned her Head backwards, feeling her ſelf choaking, ſhe flung backwards, thruſt away the man behind her, and in ſtruggling ſlipt off the Chair. At which inſtant I loſt my hold of the Ligature, and ſhe lay choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. I ſaw the cauſe, and getting hold again of the Ligature, relieved her, then raiſed her up, and, having a little refreſhed her with Drink, placed her again in a clear light, and paſſing my Sciſſors down lower, with one Snip cut it off, and brought it away with the Ligature. She gargled with Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, and was in few days cured by touching it with the Vitriol and Alume-ſtones. Since that time ſhe hath not been troubled with Defluxions, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a good health to this day.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman of about 15 years of age was brought to me out of a neighbouring Village with both her Tonſills preternaturally ſwelled.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of both Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> She had been long ſubject to a Catarrh, and had been frequently in danger of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in the night with the Fluxion. I propoſed the Exciſion of them, as the ſpeedieſt way and leaſt painfull: but ſhe not permitting it, I went about the Extirpation of them with Cauſtick-ſtones and <hi>ol. vitrioli</hi> interchangeably uſed. I began with the right ſide, which was the leſſer Tonſill, and preſt my Cauſtick to the middle of it: then pulling it out, I preſt upon the ſame place with a Stick dipt <hi>in oleo vitrioli:</hi> and ſo applied them interchangeably, (as I ſaid.) Between while ſhe gargled with Water, and took a breathing-time. Then I proceeded again in the work with Cauſticks. But it is not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what a diſturbance I met with from a frothy <hi>Saliva</hi> filling her Mouth the while to the very choaking of her. I wondred at it, but was told by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſtanding by her, that it was her Diſeaſe; and upon that account they had been directed to me as their laſt Refuge. At that ſitting I penetrated into the body of the Gland, and eat it hollow, not unlike a worm-eaten Nut. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wearied her and my ſelf, I waſhed out the Salts, and diſmiſſed her. The next day ſhe came again with it much diminiſhed; the middle of it had been conſumed, and the Shell was contracted. I fell to work on the forepart near its <hi>baſis,</hi> and eaſily penetrating through the externall part, worked down the edges afore me, and in three or four ſittings waſted the Gland ſo, that there remained onely a Prominency in the <hi>baſis;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raw, I conſumed it by touching it with the Vitriol-ſtone daily: to which purpoſe I have them alſo fitted in Shafts, ſo as they cannot ſlip out, though they ſhould break in the uſe. Whilſt this latter was cicatrizing, I began with the bigger on the left ſide, after the ſame manner as hath been ſaid of the former. But the work growing tedious by reaſon of the continuall flowing of that ſpumous Humour, I concluded the Extirpation of that by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:95669:175"/>Ligature and Sciſſors, and cicatrizing it with the Vitriol and Alume-ſtones, diſmiſſed her cured. Since which I have ſeen her often, and am ſatisfied that ſhe is freed of the former Diſturbances by the extirpation of thoſe preternaturall bodies.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentlewoman of about ſixteen years of age,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of both Tonſills.</note> nearly related to a neighbouring Phyſician, came out of the Country diſeaſed as in the former Obſervation, with much the like Accidents of Catarrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> attending. In viewing theſe Tonſills, obſerving ſome little Poroſity in them, I made ſearch, and did eaſily paſs in a ſmall Probe, without drawing any bloud or cauſing pain. They were perfect <hi>Fungi,</hi> and required to be eradicated. I would have done it by Ligature and Sciſſors: but it not being admitted, I proceeded by Cauſtick, as aboveſaid; and not meeting with that diſturbance from the <hi>Saliva</hi> as in the former work, I went on more eaſily, and the ſooner extirpated them. Since when ſhe hath been freed of the foreſaid Diſturbances, and enjoys a good health.</p>
                     <p>There alſo happeneth an Elongation of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> through the abundance of ſalivous Humour flowing upon it: in which caſe, if it touch upon the root of the Tongue or upon the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> it cauſeth a frequent hauking, and in progreſs maketh a vexatious Catarrh.</p>
                     <p>Such was the caſe of a Servant-maid to a Noble Lady in the Country.<note place="margin">8. Obſervat.</note> Various Medicaments had been preſcribed ineffectually: I being in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was deſired to ſee her. Looking into her Mouth, I ſaw the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> hang dangling upon the root of the Tongue. It was not ſwelled nor infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I ſuppoſing it the cauſe of her Diſtemper, took hold of the lower part of it with my <hi>Forceps,</hi> and at the ſame time cut it ſhorter with a pair of Sciſſors. It did not bleed a Spoonfull: and afterwards it cicatrized of it ſelf without application of any kind of Medicament, and ſhe was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by freed of the Defluxion. Such another I cut off in a Servant of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> belonging to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and ſome others who were ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and thereby freed them of their Catarrh, when all other Remedies failed.</p>

                     <p>A Gentlewoman aged 35 years came to me recommended by Sr. <hi>Fr. Pruj.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of <hi>Ranula.</hi>
                        </note> She had a large Tumour lying between her Jaws under the Tongue, and reaching to her Fore-teeth, making a great Swelling externally under the Chin. It cauſed a Croaking in her Speech, and ſeemed troubleſome to her. She had paſſed through a Courſe of Phyſick, and uſed various Medicaments to it unſucceſsfully. I propoſed the letting out the Matter by actuall Cautery: but ſhe not permitting it, I opened it by making an Inciſion on each ſide near the Togue, and diſcharged about two Bloud-porringers full of an albugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Matter: upon which the Tumour ſunk. I then made a ſearch with a Probe, and perceived the Matter had not onely made a deep Cavity down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but alſo rendred all the inner part of the Tongue hollow. I dreſſed the Abſceſſe with <hi>ſyrup. de roſis ſiccis,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. ad herniam</hi> with a third part of <hi>empl. Caeſaris</hi> externally under the Chin; deterging it afterwards with a Solution of <hi>mel Aegyptiac. in decoct. ſalviae, beton. apii,</hi> &amp;c. then incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cicatrized it. But ſome while after it roſe again in a Tumour as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Upon ſight whereof I opened it by actuall Cautery on both ſides of the <hi>Ranula,</hi> by which the Matter was again diſcharged, and the Tumour waſted. During the time I was endeavouring the Cure, ſhe was purged,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:95669:176"/>and put into an Antiſtrumaticall courſe of Phyſick, and was at laſt cured as aboveſaid. Whether ſhe relapſed afterwards I know not, having neither ſeen nor heard of her from that time to this.</p>
                     <p>An old Gentlewoman came out of the country to me with a long Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on each ſide under her Tongue, of a fleſhy colour,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of <hi>Ranula.</hi>
                        </note> which felt under my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers like the Gills of a Fiſh. They were not painfull, but very uneaſie to her. I ſuppoſed them to have Matter in them, and attempted to ſhrink and dry it up, as hath been propoſed in the method of Cure; but without ſucceſſe. I then ſlit the one open the whole length; but there flowed out onely a florid bloud, which I ſtopt by waſhing her Mouth <hi>cum aceto:</hi> then laid open the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on the other ſide. They cut like cartilaginous bodies. I ſtopt the blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this like as I had done the other, and dreſſed them both with an armed Probe dipt <hi>in tinctura vitrioli dulcificati,</hi> deſigning to dry them up that way. From the time I opened them, ſhe complained of Hairs in her Mouth, and frequently endeavoured with her fingers to pull them out, and perſwaded me to doe the like: but I could feel no ſuch thing. She came to me daily to be dreſſed. The Abſceſſes digeſted, but the Tumours would not ſink: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cut off their Lips; yet they did not lie ſo ſmooth as I deſigned. Upon which conſideration I would have burnt them by actuall Cautery: but the mention of that ſo terrified her, that ſhe came no more to me. I have inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Caſe for the rarity of it, and am confident the actuall Cautery was the proper and certain way of Cure.</p>
                     <p>A Young fellow was commended to my hands who had a painfull Tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in his tongue. I made Inciſion into it according to its length,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of <hi>Ranula.</hi>
                        </note> and thruſt out a Stone bigger then a ſmall Olive. I dreſt the Abſceſſe with <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and thereby cured it in few days.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of WO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDS in generall.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>WO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND</hi> is a Solution of continuity in any Part of the body ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made, by any thing that cuts or tears,<note place="margin">A Wound defined.</note> with a diviſion of the Skin.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Definition</hi> differs much from what is uſually delivered by Authours; and it is fit it ſhould. For they generally defining a Wound by a Solution <hi>in parte molli,</hi> do thereby exclude a Cut made into a Bone, as that into the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> by a Pole-axe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which why it ſhould not be called a Wound I know not. I ſay, It is <hi>made by any thing that cuts or tears.</hi> Other Authours define it to be made by an externall Inſtrument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How then do they call that <hi>fracturam cum vulnere,</hi> a Fracture with a Wound, where the Bone from within makes the Wound, and thruſts it ſelf quite through the Fleſh? <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> adds to his Definition, that it be done <hi>à re ſecante &amp; acuta:</hi> yet he reckons thoſe for Wounds that are made by Bullets, although it be Cannon-ſhot. I do therefore think it fit to make my Definition more comprehenſive, and to take in whatſoever makes a ſudden Solution of continuity, at leaſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by it ſelf, on what Part ſoever it lighteth. So a Cut into a Bone is a Wound: Tearing the Fleſh, Nerve, Sinew, Tendon or Cartilage, by Bullet, Stone, Splinter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Wound. Onely I adde this reſtriction, that <hi>the Skin muſt be</hi> likewiſe <hi>divided:</hi> by which laſt words I exclude Fractures that come not through the Skin, and Contuſions if the exteriour Parts be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But by the word <hi>Skin</hi> I underſtand not onely the externall <hi>Cutis,</hi> but alſo the inward Membranes of the Gullet, Ventricle, Guts, Bladder, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and Womb; all which are capable of Wounds from ſharp Inſtruments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwallowed, or thruſt into them.</p>
                     <p>A Wound thus defined admits of many <hi>Differences,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Difference of Wounds.</note> of which I know none that can be properly called eſſentiall. Great or ſmall, deep or ſhallow, wide or narrow, ſtraight or crooked, round or angular, are but accidentall Differences. Diſtinctions taken from the Weapons, whether ſharp or blunt, Sword Rapier,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95669:179"/>or Bullet, Cut, Prick, or Tearing, are likewiſe but accidentall. Thoſe that look moſt like eſſentiall Differences are they which are taken from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in which the Wound (which is it ſelf but an Accident) inhereth, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Fleſh, Skin, Brain, Nerve, Tendon, Artery, Vein, Griſtle, Bone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, being the ſeverall Subjects of Wounds, may well be allowed to ſpecifie them; and ſo much the rather, becauſe from the nature of them we raiſe our greateſt Indications of altering the method of Cure. To this Head may likewiſe be referred the diviſion of them into Simple, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                     <p>Wounds are in themſelves ſo viſible,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> that they need no generall Marks to be known by. But the peculiar affections of the particular Parts hurt, and the methods of diſcovering what inward Part is wounded, by obſervation made of the Symptoms that happen, are fully handled in thoſe Chapters which treat of the Wounds of the ſeverall Parts.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> are there alſo delivered,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> that the young Chirurgeon may be informed how to make judgement of them, and avoid the ingaging himſelf in promiſing a Cure of ſuch Wounds as are mortall. The greater Symptoms of <hi>Gangraena, Paralyſis,</hi> and <hi>Spaſmus,</hi> I have tranſlated to <hi>Gunſhot-wounds,</hi> they being there more frequent and uſuall. <hi>Haemorrhagiae</hi> are ſpoken of in this preſent Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Wound being a Solution of continuity,<note place="margin">Intentions of Cure.</note> doth require to be made one again, Unity being the perfection of whatſoever hath a being. To effect this is the work of Nature and Art; both muſt mutually joyn their helping hands: and unleſs both the vital Faculties and nouriſhment of the Part do aſſiſt the Art of the Chirurgeon, it will be loſt labour: here muſt be a joynt meeting and agreement of all in one.</p>
                     <p>In Simple Wounds the Chirurgeon is to afford his aſſiſtence five manner of ways; the omitting of any of which will render him negligent or ignorant in his Trade.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, in carefull and diligent taking away all ſuch extraneous bodies as by their interpoſition may hinder the true Agglutination of the disjoyned Parts, whether they be concrete Bloud, Hair, Sand, Duſt, pieces of Bones, Cartilages, or pieces of the Weapons, Rags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, in bringing the Lips of the Wound even together, which were ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>The third is, in retaining the Lips ſo brought together, that they may by Conſolidation be reſtored to their former figure.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, in conſerving the Temperament and naturall Heat of the Part, in order to Unition.</p>
                     <p>The fifth is, in preventing ill Accidents, and correcting ſuch as have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeized on the Part.</p>
                     <p>Thus much is required if the Wound be onely Simple:<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in compound and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wounds.</note> but if it be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Wound, with loſs of Subſtance, or Contuſion, then he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to doe. As where there is loſs of Subſtance, there he muſt aſſiſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with his Sarcoticks, for regaining what is loſt: and where there is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, there he muſt endeavour the turning what is contuſed into <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter, which muſt be performed before there can poſſibly be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union.</p>
                     <p>As long as there is any ſtrange body or different ſubſtance to keep off the Unition,<note place="margin">The firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in taking out extraneous bodies.</note> you muſt not hope to make any Cure of a Wound. Therefore if any ſuch be to be drawn forth, before you attempt it, conſider ſeriouſly, firſt, whether it can be done or no; ſecondly, whether ſafely.</p>
                     <p>For, firſt, ſometimes the Weapon ſticketh ſo faſt, that by no art it can be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95669:179"/>extracted. Then it is of neceſſity to be left to Nature, who in this caſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worketh Miracles. For I have known pieces of Splinters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes ſtick ſo faſt in the inward Parts, or to have been ſo incloſed, that we could by no means get them out: yet at length, upon Apoſtemation of the Part, they have thruſt forth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, you are to conſider whether you may with ſafety pluck out the Weapon or no. Some will live a day with the Weapon in their Bodie, who would expire upon the moment of Extraction. But if your judgement ſuggeſt to you that the Patient is recoverable, make haſt, out with it before the Part be inflamed.</p>
                     <p>If the Weapon have pierced deep,<note place="margin">Which way the Weapon is to be drawn out.</note> and through great Veſſells and Nervous places; or if the Part oppoſite to it be full of Veins, Arteries and Nerves, or have a Bone lying in the way, or over againſt the Wound; if there be no great fear of Laceration, pull it out the ſame way it went in. For the effecting of which, our Maſters have left us variety of Inſtruments, the Figure and Uſe whereof you may ſee in <hi>Scultetus.</hi> But if the Point of the Weapon have pierced above half way through the Member, and there be no Bones nor notable Veſſells to hinder you, (here is uſe of your Anatomy and exact knowledge of the Parts,) either thruſt the Weapon through, or make way for it by Inciſion on the contrary ſide: but beware the Weapon be not too big, leſt you do make two large Wounds for one.</p>
                     <p>If the Weapon ſtick in the Bone, move it up and down to looſen its Point,<note place="margin">Weapon ſtuck in a Bone.</note> and then pluck it out: but in caſe it will not move, cut away the Bone before you extract it.</p>
                     <p>If a Weapon be faſtened betwixt two Joynts,<note place="margin">Weapon ſtuck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Joynts.</note> make an Extenſion of the Parts both ways, as it is the manner in Fractures and Diſlocations, that ſo the Tendons and Ligaments being ſtretched, the Weapon may with more eaſe come out. But doe this with moderation, leſt you break ſome notable Veſſells, and a Flux of bloud or ſome ill Accident befall you in your extracting it. It will be neceſſary in this work, that you conſider the poſition the Part was in when the Wound was inflicted. <hi>Geſner</hi> hath a Story, in his <hi>Obſervat. de Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgiae dignitate &amp; praeſtantia,</hi> of a Chirurgeon, who when he could by no means get forth an Arrow, asked the wounded Patient in what poſture of his body he received the Wound. Underſtanding it was done an Horſeback, he placed him in a riding poſture, and immediately drew out the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
                     <p>The Weapon thus drawn out, cleanſe it from Rags or ought elſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Wound to bleed, accordingly as you in your judgment ſhall think fit, ſtill having reſpect to the Conſtitution and Habit of body, that what is in the ſmall Veins cut aſunder may flow out, as well to hinder Inflammation, as the generation of much Matter. The Bleeding ſtaid, if there be Hair growing about the Wound, ſhave it off: then wipe away the clotted Bloud with a Sponge dipt in Red wine, Oxycrate, or Water. But if it ſtick deep in the Wound, be not too buſie with your armed Probe, for thereby you may ſtir up a new Bleeding; whereas this concreted Bloud keeps the Wound warm, and defends it from the outward Air; and by digeſtion Nature will thruſt it forth.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention is performed by bringing the Lips of the Wound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly together.<note place="margin">The ſecond Intention, in making Unition.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Intention is delivered in a few words, but they are to be obſerved as a Law; for without that Reduction of the Lips, a ſlow and deformed Healing follows. Nature hath nothing to doe here in bringing the Lips together, that is the ſole work of the Chirurgeon; who muſt not lay a Pledgit, or croud a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:95669:180"/>Doſſill of Lint or Tent into a little Wound: no, that is the way to keep the Wound open, and make it painfull, whereby Defluxions are ſtirred up, the Temperament of the Part weakened, and the Cure prolonged; contrary to the intention of all who have writ of Wounds, and to the practice of our knowing Chirurgeons here. Yet amongſt the Pretenders to that Art we often meet with ſuch work. As for inſtance:</p>
                     <p>A Young man was wounded near <hi>High-gate</hi> in the Back,<note place="margin">Obſervation concerning Doſſills in ſimple Wounds.</note> ſlanting under the right <hi>Scapula;</hi> he had another Wound alſo on the Back, and another through the upper part of the left Shoulder, with a long Gaſh over the Forehead, and others beſides, ſome whereof were not conſiderable. The next day being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither to dreſs theſe Wounds, I found them all diſtended with Tents and Doſſills of Lint, diſpoſed to inflame and ſwell, and the Patient exceeding full of pain. After I had taken out theſe extraneous bodies, my endeavour was to dreſs them ſo, as I might incline their upheaved Lips to return to their naturall ſite. To which purpoſe I fomented them with Milk, and applied Pledgits ſpred with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> embrocating them with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> them by <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> and Bandage with gentle Compreſſion, I dreſt him up; and afterwards here in Town cured him by Sarcoticks and Epuloticks, as in Compound Wounds; a longer work, which at firſt ought to have been done by Agglutination. Parts ſeparated and disjoyned are to be brought together gently and equally, that they may touch one another, and ſo be prepared for Unition.</p>
                     <p>This muſt be done (I ſay) firſt <hi>gently;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Unition to be effected, firſt, gently:</note> 
                        <hi>ſenſim &amp; ſenſim,</hi> as <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath it, by little and little; not haſtily at one pluck. If the Parts be equally ſoft, bring them equally together: if the one ſoft, the other hard, and not to be moved but with difficulty, bring the ſoft part to the ſtubborn. If the Parts be grown ſtiff with cold, as when the party hath been left in the field all night, which after a Battell hath often happened, (and particularly to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fellow, a common Souldier, that uſed to wear an iron Scull under a Cap, and from thence was called by a Nick-name; his Wounds were large, and the Lips hardened with the cold, and it was well for him, his Bleeding being thereby ſtayed;) in this caſe you are to ſupple them by fomenting them with Milk or warm Water, or elſe embrocate them with Oil, till you perceive the Lips made ſoft enough for your purpoſe, before you endeavour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">ſecondly, equally.</note> 
                        <hi>equally,</hi> that the Parts cut aſunder may anſwer one another, as well in the top as the bottom, brim to brim, and, if poſſible, underneath Veſſell to Veſſell; that Nature may be in a capacity of doing its own work, and by virtue of its Balſam re-unite, agglutinate, conſolidate, and heal the Wounds: in all which Intentions ſhe is the Agent, and the Chirurgeon onely the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. Which Aſſiſtence that it may be the more effectually given, we muſt go on to the Third.</p>
                     <p>The Third Intention is,<note place="margin">The third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in retaining the parts united.</note> Deligation, or retaining the Parts ſo joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>For the effecting of this, our famous Maſters have left us two principall means, <hi>Faſciae</hi> and <hi>Suturae,</hi> Rowling and Stitching: to which ſome, nay moſt of them, added <hi>Fibulas,</hi> or Claſps. But I will not put you upon that. If the Wound be ſmall, and in a Fleſhy part, and according to the length of the Fibres or Member, you may perform the Cure by <hi>Bandage;</hi> for here Nature will tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act her part, by application of bloud and nouriſhment to both ſides indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and finiſh the <hi>Coalitus</hi> without your farther aſſiſtence. And this is that which gives ſuch credit to the Sympathetick Powder. In the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, it becomes every Chirurgeon to be much experienced, in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95669:180"/>reſpect of the unſpeakable commodities which the whole Art receiveth thereby.</p>
                     <p>By Bandage not onely are Parts dextrouſly accommodated for Union;<note place="margin">Their uſe.</note> but ſuch alſo as would unnaturally grow together are kept aſunder. In Burnings, Scaldings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Fingers would many times grow together, the Chin would grow to the Breaſt, the Arms to the Sides, were they not this way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. By them are Fluxes averted, and the delapſe of Humours into the inferiour Parts forbidden; and, being already lodged, they are preſt out. By theſe are good Juices advantageouſly forced into Parts emaciated. As, if the right Arm pine away, rowl up the left from the Hand to the Arm-pit, that the Bloud being preſt out into the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> or rather hindred to flow in ſo faſt by the Artery, may with more eagerneſs flow into the other ſide, where it was wanting. By theſe we ſee great Fluxes of bloud, large <hi>Haemorrhagiae</hi> every day ſtayed. By them are ill-ſhaped Wounds brought into better figures, and made more apt to be cured. By them is the force of your Applications helpt and furthered, they keeping them cloſe to their proper places, where your care hath beſtowed them. By them is the true naturall form and beauty of the Part commonly preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Three eſpeciall ſorts of Faſciation or Rowling,<note place="margin">Three ſorts of eſpeciall uſe.</note> pertaining to our preſent work, have the Worthies of our Profeſſion commended to poſterity. The firſt they term <hi>Incarnatrix</hi> or <hi>Agglutinatrix,</hi> the Incarnative or Agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: the ſecond, <hi>Retentrix,</hi> or Retentive: the third, <hi>Expultrix,</hi> or Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Incarnative</hi> is that which brings the Lips of the Wound together,<note place="margin">1. Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> and conſerveth them in their right figure. It muſt be more ſtrict then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, and more looſe then the Expulſive; and is the moſt uſefull in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, freſh, and yet bleeding Wounds. The manner of performing it is thus.</p>
                     <p>Have in readineſs a Rowler of ſuch matter, length and breadth as I ſhall anon ſhew you; rowl it up at both ends firmly to the middle; then lay the middle part of the Rowler on that part which is oppoſite to the Wound, to prevent pain and inflammation. You are then, after you have made a turn upon the Wound with both ends of the Rowler, to goe up with the one, and down with the other, and take ſo many turns about the Part as may be requiſite for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the Flux of bloud, or, according to the Seaſon of the year, to defend it from cold, and yet not keep the Wound too hot, for that may weaken the Part. You muſt alſo be carefull that your Bandage be not too hard, ſo as to intercept the Spirits. Your Rowler running downwards will preſſe out the Matter from the affected Part, and by paſſing upward hinder the influx of Humours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Faſcia Retentrix</hi> is uſed to keep your Dreſſings on cloſe about the Wound. They for the moſt part are onely of uſe in Wounds of the Head.<note place="margin">2. Retentive.</note> There muſt be a moderation in binding with this Bandage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faſcia Expulſiva</hi> is performed by a Rowler of one head:<note place="margin">3. Expulſive.</note> the ſpeciall uſe of it is, to expell Matter out of <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> or Sinuous Ulcers; as alſo to prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of Humours, and to expell ſuch as have already ſeated themſelves upon the Part wounded or otherwiſe. Doe it in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>Begin in the ſound part, beneath the ſeat of the Humours,<note place="margin">How hard to bind.</note> and rowl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pretty ſtreight at firſt, and by degrees; as you come nearer the Mouth of the Wound, gentlier and gentlier. If you will preſs out the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Cavity of the Wound, you muſt rowl looſely there a turn or two, then harder, and yet a little ſtreighter, the higher you goe, to hinder the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of Humours; but not too hard, for fear of harm. <hi>Terminus ſit bona labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis

But this your judgement will teach you to alter, according to the conformation, ſhape and poſiture of Parts.</p>
                     <p>Faſten not your Rowler by tying a knot; nor yet ſow it upon the Wound, or where you cannot eaſily come at it again; leſt you hurt your Patient. Quickneſs and neatneſs diſtinguiſheth the Workman from the ignorant and unskilfull. As the Subject is more noble you work on, ſo ſtrive to perform your office more excellently; intending not onely your profit, but decency in the diſpatch; that you may pleaſe the Eye, both in the time of, and when you have done your work: thus ſhall you gain credit to your ſelf, and endear your Patient to ſubmit the more readily to your Rules, which is not the leaſt part of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>The next thing that offers it ſelf for keeping the Lips of the Wound together are <hi>Sutures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sutures. Three ſorts.</note> and they are of three ſorts; firſt, the Incarnative, ſecondly, the Reſtringent, and thirdly, the Conſerver.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is that which is in moſt uſe amongſt us,<note place="margin">1. Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> and is by making ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stitches at a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the Glover's Stitch,<note place="margin">2. Reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, or Glovers Stitch.</note> and much in uſe among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſtitch almoſt all Wounds by it. In the Forehead and Face I have ſeen them bring the Wounds very cloſe: the third day they commonly cut the Knots off, and draw the Thread out; then with dry Stitches keep them ſo brought together; and in two or three days more they cure them.</p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:95669:181"/>
                     <p>The third Stitch is of uſe in great Wounds, and thoſe of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Conſerver.</note> &amp;c. to hold them forcibly together. It is performed with Pins or Needles, as in Hair-lips.</p>
                     <p>There are four ſorts of Stitches, mentioned by the Ancients, for the Wounds of the Belly, whereof I ſhall take notice onely of one, which I have made uſe of my ſelf in the ſtitching of thoſe Wounds; the manner whereof is thus: You are to take up the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> on one ſide, and leave it on the other; and then take it up on the other ſide, and leave it on this. It is ſo made, that the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which is a dry body, may be united with the Muſculous fleſh: otherwiſe onely the Fleſhy parts would unite, and the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> lie open, upon which a <hi>Hernia</hi> would certainly ſucceed, and the Patient be put to the trouble of wearing a Truſſe the reſt of his life. The Thread you are to uſe for this purpoſe ought to be a ſtrong round white Thread proportionable to the Needle, and both accordingly as the Wound requireth. You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to cleanſe the Wound of its clotted Bloud, if you can: but however go on with your work, that Bloud will find its paſſage out.</p>
                     <p>In great Fluxes of bloud the Glover's Stitch is beſt. Endeavour in your Stitching to bring the Artery and Vein to its wounded fellow; ſo ſhall you the likelier ſecure your ſelf, and make the work more ſeemly.</p>
                     <p>In the Incarnative, you are to conſider the Wound. If you find it but the length of a finger's breadth or a little more, 'tis not worth the ſtitching: your Medicaments and Bandage will keep the Lips together, and quickly heal it.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound be of two Fingers breadth, make one Stitch in the middle;<note place="margin">The diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Stit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> if three fingers breadth, make two Stitches; if four fingers breadth, three Stitches; and ſo go on, making a Stitch leſs then the Wound is in number of fingers. Sometimes in declining Parts we make our Stitches at a little more diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The time of taking out the Stitches is, when the Parts are agglutinated;<note place="margin">Time of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the Stitches.</note> which is ſooner or later according to the Habit of body, or Seaſon of the year. Commonly in great tranſverſe Wounds eight days are required; in leſs Wounds not ſo deep, three or four days: in the Face, doe it the next Dreſſing, leſt the Stitches make ſo many Scars. But in this work you muſt uſe your judgment:<note place="margin">Caution.</note> for ſometimes the Wound may ſeem to be agglutinated, while the Lips are held together by Suture, which, after the Stitches are cut out, is not ſo exactly cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized, but that you might have done better to have left the Stitches a day longer. But in this caſe the dry Stitch may help you;<note place="margin">Dry Stitches.</note> and that is another way of keeping theſe Wounds together. They are made with little bits of ſtrong linen Cloath, triangular or quadrangular, or of ſuch figure as may ſerve your purpoſe. Theſe are moſt proper in the Face, to avoid the other way of Stitching: yet they are of uſe in other Parts, to preſerve the Lips cloſe. They are commonly ſpred with a Mixture of <hi>ſang. dracon. thuris, aloes, farin. tritic. gumm. tragacanth. an. part. aequal. cum albumin. ovi.</hi> They ought to be of ſuch a conſiſtence, that they may adhere firmly to the Skin. They muſt be applied at ſuch diſtance as they may beſt perform their work. After they are dried on, you muſt bring the Lips of the Wound cloſe together, and retain them ſo, taking care they be not wet by the Matter.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Intention is, the preſerving the naturall Temperament of the Part, that thereby Agglutination may be obtained.<note place="margin">The fourth Intention, in preſerving the naturall tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Which Agglutination indeed, as I have already hinted, is the work of nature alone, by whoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power all Parts wounded, disjoyned and broken, are knit and made one again. But in regard there is a certain <hi>Medium,</hi> which anſwers in proportion to a Glew, required in this work, Nature taketh what is next hand, even
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:95669:182"/>the Nouriſhment of the Part which is hurt, to make it of. <hi>

Great care muſt therefore be taken, that the Bloud offend neither in quantity nor quality. Too much bringeth on proud and looſe Fleſh; as too little doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Part, and affordeth not a competency of Matter for the work. If the quality of the Bloud be ill, it cannot produce good Fleſh: as the Bloud is, ſuch is the Fleſh.</p>

To prevent Inflammation, I forbad him Wine. The next morning he complained he had not ſlept that night, that he was faint and ſick, and that his Wound was the leaſt of his ailment. That day he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faint and ill, and the next morning complained again of his want of Reſt; and that afternoon he ſwouned, and complained he could not live without Wine. He had good Broths, Caudles, and ſuch like; and I believe he did drink ſome Wine. (But he was allowed by his Maſter a Bottle of a Quart every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for his Draught, and was ſeldome ſober.) His Wound was indigeſted and inflamed. I complied with his deſire; he drank again as he pleaſed; his Sickneſs went off, his Wound digeſted, and he was ſoon after cured.</p>
                     <p>This I have ſeen often in ſome of the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> at Sea, who drank extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, and were full of drink at the time of their Sea-fights. I could ſcarce ever cure any of them without allowing them Wine; and thereby their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were kept up, and I had the liberty to bleed them as I thought fit. When theſe kind of people eat as plentifully as they drink, they then upon a ſudden change of Diet labour under a <hi>Crapula,</hi> and are ſubject to Fainting, or have Colick, <hi>Dyſuria,</hi> &amp;c. and if the Wound happen in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> it gives a ſuſpicion (to thoſe that are not well skilled in the Symptoms of Wounds) to think that it ariſeth from the penetration of the Wound, when there is no ſuch thing; and ſo by the perſeverance in thoſe Rules the Patient ſuffers.</p>
                     <p>It hath been a common Saying, <hi>A Hair of the ſame Dog,</hi> and thought that Brandy-wine is a common relief to ſuch. What then muſt become of ſuch a one,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:95669:182"/>after a hard drinking for many months together, if he chance in heat of drink to be wounded, and from that time his Chirurgeon condemn him to Ptiſan for a week together, nay two days? will he not faint and languiſh, and his Wounds become indigeſted and inflamed? You may laugh at my pleading for them: but I hope you will conſider I am a Water-drinker the while.</p>
                     <p>As for other things, ſuch Diet is to be obſerved as their Strength will permit. We do not uſe to purge with Catharticks in Wounds, leſt by ſtirring Matter it flow to the weak Part: but we allow Lenitives, as <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Tamarinds, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Senna,</hi> Rhubarb, with <hi>Sal prunellae;</hi> alſo Electuaries, as <hi>elect. lenitiv. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prun. ſyr. roſ. ſolut. de cichor. cum rhabarb.</hi> alſo Broths wherein have been boiled Lettice, Succory, Endive, Sorrell, Purſlane, Borrage, Bugloſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we let them bloud according to the Strength of their body, and as Symptoms indicate.</p>
                     <p>Another part of the Regiment of wounded perſons will conſiſt in giving of Vulnerary drinks: of which we find many mentioned by Authours,<note place="margin">Vulnerary Drinks, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Electuaries.</note> and the <hi>materia medica</hi> very large; witneſs that great tribe of Vulneraries in <hi>Parkinſon</hi>'s Herball.</p>
                     <p>The moſt common Simples with us in <hi>England</hi> are Comfry, Bugle, Ladies-mantle, Agrimony, Sanicle, Pauls-betony, Fluellen, Perwinkle, Mugwort, Plantane, Horſe-tail, Adders-tongue, Avens, Cinquefoil, Wild-tanſie, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Ground-ivy, Golden-rod, Herb-trinity, Centory, St. Johns-wort, Snake-weed, Knot-graſs, Mouſe-ear, Yarrow, Scordium, Strawberrie-leaves and roots, Tormentill Biſtort, Valerian, Red roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some of theſe are made choice of to be boiled in Water, or White wine, with an addition of Honey: of which ſort you have ſufficient examples in the <hi>Decoctum traumaticum</hi> of the <hi>Pharmacop. Lond.</hi> Their principal uſe is in Wounds of the <hi>Thorax</hi> and <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> yet they are frequently preſcribed in all great Wounds. Sometimes alſo, if the Diſeaſe run out to a length, we adde <hi>Guaiacum, Sarſa,</hi> and Scorbuticall Medicines. There are likewiſe Powders made of Crab's-eyes, Corall, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Electuaries of ſome of the foreſaid Roots and Herbs beaten up with theſe Powders.</p>
                     <p>The Particular Regiment is,<note place="margin">2. Particular.</note> in preſerving the naturall Heat and Tone of the Parts, without which we can hope for no Union. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, I muſt put you in mind, that there is not any Part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy admits of a Solution of continuity without Pain. Every Scratch in the Skin, and little Cut in the Finger, is painfull: much more are the deeper Wounds in the Fleſh. This Pain ſtirs up a Heat fermenting in the ſerous part of the Bloud, which readily makes way to the Wound, and, if not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented, diſtendeth and raiſeth the Part into a Tumour with Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If this happens in a full Body, or one of an ill Habit, where the Bloud is ſerous, and more apt to ferment, the miſchief is the greater. And if the Wound be in a declining Part, as the Legs, the influx of Humours is more abundant; and the Member through its weakneſs not being able to aſſimilate, nor yet expell them, is the cauſe that Crudities do heap upon the lower Parts, and make an Oedematous Tumour.</p>
                     <p>To make this more plain, I ſhall give you one Inſtance of the many that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen daily. A young Gentleman about 18 years of age,<note place="margin">A perſon prickt with a Thorn in his Leg.</note> of a good Habit of body, one day ſporting in the Country with his Gun and Dogs, was prickt with a Thorn on the outſide of the Calf of his Leg. He took little notice of it till the Evening, and then dreſt it with a little Balſam. The next Morning it was more painfull and inflamed, and at length terminated in a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> I was then ſent for, and found the Tumour large and full of Matter, and in the lower part about the Foot an oedematous Tumour. I opened the Swelling above, and, diſcharging a quantity of Matter, cured the Patient as is uſuall in <hi>Phlegmons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:95669:183"/>
                     <p>If this perſon had been treated according to the univerſall Regiment, by Bleeding and lenient Purgatives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, if onely after this particular Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in preſerving the Temperament of the Part, he had been dreſſed, as in this caſe he ought to have been,<note place="margin">Medicaments proper in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi>
                        </note> by Refrigerants and Aſtringents, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the influx of Humours, and with a Pledgit of <hi>baſilicon,</hi> to cauſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation in the feſtred Scratch, with convenient Bandage over all; it had preſerved the Tone of the Part, and cured the Soar without farther trouble.</p>
                     <p>To proceed rationally by this Intention in Wounds, your firſt Application ought to be of ſuch Medicaments as have an agglutinative faculty, as <hi>bolus Armois. ſang. dracon. thus, aloes, gum. elemi, colophon. terebinth.</hi> and apply over them ſuch as are cooling, and of an aſtringent quality, to reſiſt the influx of Humours, as Cloaths dipt in the Juices of the following Plants, <hi>fol. plantag. equiſeti, millefol. vineae pervinoae, ulmi,</hi> or Red wine, or Oxycrate. To which you may adde ſome of theſe Powders, <hi>flor. roſ. rub. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ. gallar. far. bord. &amp; fabar. &amp; oleum olivar. matur.</hi> Theſe ſimple Medicaments may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably mixed according to the Habit of body and condition of the Wound. In ſmall and ſuperficiall Wounds, Nature of her own accord is wont to effect the Cure; ſhe ſeldome requiring more from us, them that the Lips of the Wound be brought cloſe together, and defended from the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid, and with Bandage ſo retained. A Pledgit of <hi>liniment. Arcei</hi> with <hi>empl. diapalmae</hi> frequently ſerves the turn. But in greater Wounds that will not ſo eaſily be cured, we ſtitch the Lips together, and ſprinkle them with ſuch like Powder: ℞ <hi>bol. armen. thuris, ſang. dracon. an. part. aequal.</hi> and apply a Mixture of ſome of the ſame Powder with the White of an egg over them, with a Compreſſe preſt out of Oxycrate, and a ſutable Bandage over all. This is generally the way: but leſt by the adheſion of this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtick Medicament the Lips of the Wound ſhould be torn or diſturbed in taking the Dreſſing off, I chuſe rather to apply overe the ſprinkled Powders a Pledgit with ſome of theſe following ſarcotick Unguents: ℞ <hi>terebinth. Venet.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>gum. elemi</hi> ℥ij. <hi>ſang. dracon. thuris, maſtich. an.</hi>

In all Wounds where I deſign to cure by Agglutination, and would preſerve my Stitches, I forbear the uſe of Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſlabby Medicaments: nor will you have occaſion for ſuch Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if you proceed rationally, as hath been above ſaid; for Nature will doe her part towards the Agglutination of the Wound, if you defend it from the influx of Humours. I always accounting theſe Wounds near cured, when the Lips are retained cloſe together, and dreſſed as aboveſaid.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I have proceeded in the Agglutination of Simple Wounds:<note place="margin">Of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Wounds.</note> I ſhall now conſider of Wounds with loſſe of Subſtance made by Bill, Pole-axe, Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome cutting twice or thrice in one or near one place, whereby the Wound is large, tranſverſe, yea and oblique, at the ſame time, and the Lips contracted various ways, and ſo the Cure is rendred much more difficult. Theſe kind of Wounds are not ſo often ſeen in times of Peace, but in the Wars they are frequent, eſpecially when the Horſe-men fall in amongſt the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and cruelly hack them; the poor Souldiers the while ſheltring their Heads with their Arms, ſometime with the one, then the other, untill they be both moſt cruelly mangled: and yet the Head fareth little the better the while for their Defence, many of them not eſcaping with leſſe then two or three Wounds through the Scull to the Membranes, and often into the Brain. And if the man fly, and the Enemy purſue, his Hinder parts meet with great
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95669:183"/>Wounds, as over the Thighs, Back, Shoulders, and Neck, Mr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> now one of the Chirurgeons of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpitall,</hi> was once with me aſſiſting in the dreſſing ſuch. At <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> Mr. <hi>John Chaſe,</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> helped me in the like work. One of the Souldiers had ſuch a gaſh thwart the Nape of his Neck, that it was a wonder to us he lived. His Wound was full of Maggots; and ſo were thoſe of all the reſt that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Hinder parts, they having been ſome days undreſt.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure of theſe Wounds, you are in the firſt place to cleanſe them, and then to endeavour the bringing of the Lips together by the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Suture, making ſo many Stitches as may retain them together. And if you doubt this way not ſufficient, you may then, as in a Hair-lip, paſſe Needles or Pins through the Lips of the Wound, with little Plates of Lead to ſecure them from tearing. But if the Wound be ſo deep as you ſuſpect its incarning in the bottome, you muſt leave a declining Orifice for the diſcharge of Matter. If the Wound hath lain long undreſſed, or were not ſtitched at the firſt dreſſing, and be now ſo contracted and ſtubborn that the Lips of it will not be brought near one another; you muſt then foment them warm with ſome lenient Decoction <hi>ex fol. &amp; rad. althaeae, malvae, viol. ſem. hini,</hi> &amp;c. or with new Milk; then joyn them together, as hath been ſaid, and dreſſe them as Wounds ſo ſtitcht. But if you left a declining Orifice, keep it open by a ſmall Tent dipt in ſome ſuch Medicament as ſhall be by and by preſcribed, and after Digeſtion withdraw the Tent, and heal it as ſuch like Wounds. The greater Wounds, which cannot be brought together by Suture, muſt be digeſted, and ſo diſpoſed as that new Fleſh may be generated to fill up the Cavity: to which purpoſe ℞ <hi>terebinth.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>far. hord.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> vj. <hi>thuris</hi>

After the Wound is digeſted, you may deterge with <hi>mundif.

The Seeds and Roots are to be cut and beaten, and infuſed two days in White-wine: then the Oil and bruiſed Wheat muſt be put to it, and ſo boiled together to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Wine; then ſtrain the Liquour hard out, and adde the <hi>terebinth. thus,</hi> &amp;c. giving it two or three walms more, and reſerve it for your uſe. In theſe larger Wounds, it will be neceſſary to apply warm Stupes wrung out of Red wine wherein have been infuſed <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. nue. eupreſſ.</hi> &amp;c. But thoſe Wounds that are full of Maggots or Worms ought to be waſht with a Decoction <hi>abſinth. card. benedict. rad. gentian. myrrh. aloes,</hi> &amp;c. and deterged as aboveſaid with Mundificatives: after which you may proceed in the ſame method of Cure as is before mentioned. As to the time of dreſſing Wounds, the ſecond dreſſing ought not to be till the third day, by which time we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them ſomewhat digeſted: from that time every other day may be ſufficient. <hi>Galen,</hi> ſpeaking of the dreſſing Ulcers, ſaith, he dreſſed them but every third day, though the Matter flowed very much; and but every fourth day in Winter. Indeed the too frequent dreſſing is hurtfull: yet there may be occaſion of opening them ſooner then by him propoſed, for the ſtrengthening of Bandage,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95669:184"/>or for the preſerving of the Stitches by putting on dry Stitches. Alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Matter cauſeth the Suture to relax, and the Lips of the Wound to open again: therefore that ought to be left to the diſcretion of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon.</p>
                     <p>After the Cavity in the Wound is incarned, you may cicatrize with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. deſiccat. rubr. aq. calcis,</hi> &amp;c. or with the Vitriol or Alume-ſtone, and dry Lint.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound be made by a Fall or Blow with great Contuſion,<note place="margin">Of contuſed Wounds.</note> you muſt endeavour that the bruiſed Fleſh be digeſted and turned into Matter; to which purpoſe <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> is proper, applied warm upon Lint, or diſſolved in <hi>ol. lumbric. lini,</hi> or ſuch like, anointing the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. &amp; myrtill. cum album. ovor.</hi> with which you may alſo make up a Reſtrictive, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>bol. Armen, ſang. dracon. balanſt. flor. roſ. rub.</hi> and apply it over all. But if the Wound were of ſome days continuance before you were conſulted, you muſt then foment it with Diſcutients, and embrocate the contuſed Parts with <hi>ol. cham. ſambuc. rutac.</hi> &amp;c. and continue the application of Maturatives, proceeding as is ſet down in the Chapter of <hi>Ecchymoſis.</hi> After ſeparation of the contuſed Fleſh, the loſs of Subſtance muſt be reſtored by Sarcoticks, and the Wound cured as aboveſaid; remembring that in theſe Contuſions Venaeſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moſt neceſſary. If the Wound be deep, and the Orifice narrow, yet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of inlarging; it muſt be laid open proportionably, that the Matter may not be retained, and render the Wound more hollow. But if the <hi>Sinus</hi> be of any great length, and ſo depending that the Matter cannot diſcharge by the Wound; you may then make a Perforation in the lower part for diſcharge of it, by Knife or Cauſtick, or both, firſt Cauſtick, then Knife; or by a Seton-needle with a twiſted Silk or Thread, as hath been ſhewed in <hi>Sinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers;</hi> and proceed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid of Wounds cut and hackt in heat of Fight by a broad Sword, happeneth ſometimes in fighting or foyning with a Rapier. For if the Thruſt be redoubled, an Attrition may be made in the lower part of the Wound: and if there be ſuch an Attrition there, or if ſome tendonous bodie be there wounded, it will be too painfull to heal by the firſt Intention; and if it run far, and deep amongſt the Muſcles, it may be a maiming of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or an indangering of his life, to cut ſuch a Wound open from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. Wherefore you ought to conſider well the manner of the Wound; and if it penetrate ſo deep, and be not capable of being laid open by reaſon of the thickneſs of it, make a ſearch with a Probe to the bottome, and feel how far diſtant it is there from the Skin: and if it do not lie far off, nor under any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Veſſell, the ſpeedieſt way of curing the Wound will be by paſſing in a Director, and cutting it open. Which done, keep it open, and permit the upper part to agglutinate. But if you think it not fit to open, yet mark the place, that in caſe there be a neceſſity of doing it afterwards, you may make the Apertion more certainly. That done, dreſs the Wound with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſhort Tent armed with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi;</hi> and embrocate the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. myrtill. &amp; aceto;</hi> over which apply <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> or ſuch like and afterwards proceed as aforeſaid. For your farther information and more caution, I ſhall give you one Inſtance of the ill effects of cutting open ſuch Wounds the whole length.</p>
                     <p>Some years ſince a young Gentleman was wounded in a Duell;<note place="margin">Of a double wound by Puncture.</note> the Rapier entred into his right Side ſlanting by his ſhort Ribs under the Muſcles, reaching within a finger's breadth of the Spine, with a redoubled Thruſt. He was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a <hi>French</hi> Chirurgeon's houſe, and dreſſed by him. The third day after I was fetcht, and ſaw the Wound inflamed and undigeſted, likewiſe the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95669:184"/>over-ſtretcht by the extraordinary bulk of the Tent. I adviſed the dreſſing it with one leſſer, and armed with a Digeſtive, alſo Embrocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. But it was in vain. This Pretender dreſſed the Wound with a Tent proportionable to the former, anointed with ſome Unguent wherein was <hi>ſang. dracon.</hi> binding a Stupe over it. By this way of dreſſing the pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation increaſing, I was fetcht again two days after, and then made a ſearch; and feeling my Probe penetrating obliquely down deep amongſt the Muſcles, within a finger's breadth of the Spine, (as aboveſaid,) I concluded it beſt to make an Opening there. Accordingly I uſed a mild Cauſtick, then dreſſed up the Wound with a leſs Tent, ſpreading it with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. embrocating it <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> &amp;c. and ſoon after applied an anodyne Cataplaſm, and ſo left the Patient to reſt. But in the night, he turning in his bed, the Cataplaſm ſlid off, and our Monſieur diſcovered a diſcolouring in the Part, and ſuppoſing it an approach of a Gangrene, I was fetcht out of my bed. Upon ſight of it, I found it onely ſtained with the Saffron and Lupins which were in the Cataplaſm, and applied it again, leaving the Patient better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But the next morning I met another Chirurgeon of the forementioned Monſieur's acquaintance. We took off Dreſſings, and ſaw the Wound dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. I propoſed the dividing the Eſcar below, to give vent that way to the Matter; but they were poſitive for the cutting open the Wound thwart all the Muſcles, the length of between 5 or 6 inches. To which purpoſe Sponges were preſt out of Melilot Emplaſter, and the Wound fill'd with them. The next day this latter Operator laid the Wound open with a pair of Sciſſors ſo far as his Sponges had dilated it, and dreſſed it up his way. The morning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wound appeared dry, and the Parts about inflamed and ſwelled very much, and continued exceeding painfull to the third day. Then they, being at a loſs, were contented to divide the Eſcar; upon which there diſcharged a quantity of Matter made by Apoſtemation in that part: yet notwithſtanding they would not inlarge that Opening, but began where they ended, and cut open the Wound to the Aperture made by the Cauſtick, and dreſſed it up as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus they having increaſed the pain, the Fluxion alſo increaſed, and a great quantity of Matter diſcharged from the lower part, alſo a large <hi>Sinus</hi> diſcovered it ſelf ſtretching over the Spine to the other Side. In order to the curing of this, they deſigned Injections; which I endeavoured to diſſwade them from: but they perſiſting in the uſe of them, I proteſted againſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and left them. They laught at me: but about the ninth day after the Patient died, and made good my prediction. For, alas! what elſe could be expected from ſuch a Diviſion of parts, and caſting in Injections, but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more ſinuous from Side to Side? whereas poſſibly by Digeſtion and good Compreſſion it might haply have healed.</p>

The way to ſtop the Bleeding as it is common in all Wounds, is, by bringing the Lips of the Wound cloſe together by Suture, and by applying ſuch Medicaments to them as have a drying and agglutinative faculty; as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Powder of Aloes Pj. <hi>thuris</hi> Pij. and Hares-furre mixt with the White of an egg, applied upon a Pledgit, alſo a Plaiſter of the ſame Reſtrictives, with Compreſs and Bandage.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95669:185"/>the Lips of it together, apply the aforeſaid Powder upon Doſſills on the bleeding Veſſells, and your Aſtringents next, with Compreſſe and Bandage over all: then place the Member in ſuch a poſition as may be for the eaſe of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>You ought to be ſpeedy in the mitigating Pain,<note place="margin">Of Pain.</note> for that nothing diſspiriteth your Patient more, nor maketh more diſturbance in Wounds, the Humours flowing abundantly to the pained Part, whence inſueth great Inflammation and Tumour.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Wounds of the Veins and Arteries.</head>
                     <p>THE next thing that offers it ſelf to our conſideration is, the Wounds of particular Parts; and firſt of the Veins and Arteries, which are ſubject to great effuſion of bloud, therefore require your ſpeedy help. You may diſtinguiſh whether the bloud be from an Arterie or a Vein, by the flowing of it, and by its colour.</p>
                     <p>From the Artery the bloud ruſhes impertuouſly and <hi>per ſaltum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs of the Artery wounded. Of the Vein wounded.</note> by reaſon of the dilatation and conſtriction of the Heart, and is of a florid colour. The Venall bloud flows with a more ſmooth and even ſtream; it is of a groſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and of a darkiſh colour.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe latter Wounds there is no great danger;<note place="margin">Prognoſtick of Vein, and Cure. Prognoſtick of Artery,</note> 
                        <hi>Galen</hi>'s Powder with the White of an egg, and the formerly propoſed way of dreſſing, will ſtay their bleeding, and cure the Wound in few days. But thoſe of the Arteries are moſt difficultly ſtopt, for that the bloud is in a moſt vigorous and ſtrong motion.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Wounds be not with loſſe of Subſtance or bruiſed Lips,<note place="margin">and Cure. Suture.</note> you may bring the Lips and Mouths of the Arteries both together, and retain them by Suture, paſſing your Needle with a ſtrong waxed Thread through both of them, making the Glovers ſtitch, which <hi>Guido</hi> calls <hi>Suppreſſio.</hi> Then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch like Emplaſtick as this; ℞ <hi>bol.

Your Bandage muſt be ſo made, that it be to the eaſe of the Patient: the Poſition ought alſo to be ſuch as may prevent Pain.<note place="margin">Ordering the Part, and Diet.</note> He muſt keep cool and quiet, and obſerve a ſlender Diet. His Drink ought alſo to be cooling and aſtringent; as Fountain-water with <hi>ſal prunell.</hi> or <hi>acetum,</hi> or with gads of Steel quencht in it, and ſweetned with Syrup of Corall, Pomegranates, Limons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or this following Draught of <hi>Quercetan</hi>'s, ℞ <hi>croci Martis, eſſentiae corallor. an.</hi> ℈j. <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſicc. &amp; myrtill. an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>aq. papaver. rhoead.</hi> ℥iiij. <hi>Miſc.</hi> ſo alſo a <hi>decoct. hord. cum ſem. papav. alb. &amp; hyoſcyam.</hi> with an addition of Roſe-water, and Sugar of Roſes, to ſweeten it; alſo a grain or two of <hi>ladanum</hi> in caſe of extremity, if the Patient bears it well.

You may uſe alſo Cupping, Friction, and Binding the remote Parts, for Derivation.</p>
                     <p>In Wound of the Artery, dreſſe not oftener then you needs muſt; once in five or ſix days may be ſufficient, whilſt there is danger of Bleeding. But if you find the bloud hath made its way through all the Dreſſings, and the Bleeding continues, take them off: and if you diſcover the Stitches broken, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95669:186"/>the Lips of the Wound incapable of being ſtitched again; conſider whether the bleeding Artery may not be taken up and tied: if it may, doe ſo. The way of doing it you may ſee in the Chapter of <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> and in one of the following Obſervations. Then proceed in the Cure by Sarcoticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if the Artery lieth ſo deep that you cannot poſſibly come to make Deligation on it, proceed by application of Eſcaroticks to the Veſſell, or by an actuall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
                     <p>If by Eſcaroticks, then you ought to cleanſe the Wound of the clotted bloud,<note place="margin">Eſcaroticks.</note> and dip your Doſſills in ſome ſuch like Powder; ℞ <hi>thur. pulv.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>aloes, gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſicc. an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>chalcanth. uſt.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>arſenici</hi>

For want of the aboveſaid Powders, take Vitriol powdered and tied in a fine Rag, and apply it to the Artery with convenient Dreſſings over it, as before-ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But if after theſe your Endeavours the Artery yet continue to bleed,<note place="margin">Cautery.</note> you muſt uſe the actuall Cautery; by which the Veſſell will ſhrink up at both ends. You may convey the Cautery down to the Artery through a <hi>Cannula:</hi> and that the Cautery may not burn through it, you may cover the outſide with a Plaiſter or Rag wet with the White of an egg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That done, dreſs the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized part with Doſſills dipt in Mucilage of Quince-ſeeds, or with the White of an egg, and embrocate the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> applying <hi>emplaſtr. diachal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. cum ſuccis plantag.</hi> &amp;c. over all. After you have allayed the heat of the Part, digeſt, incarn, and cicatrize the Wound as followeth.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 35 years of age was wounded with a Rapier on the right ſide of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> into the internall Jugular,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a wound of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Jugular.</note> through his Neck, it paſſing out below the laſt <hi>Vertebra.</hi> The Wound was ſmall, yet bled with a full ſtream. A Servant ſtopt it with his fingers, whilſt I made Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ready of our common aſtringent Powders, with the White of an egg and a little <hi>acetum,</hi> ſpred upon a Pledgit of Lint, and an Emplaſter of the ſame, with Compreſs and ſuch Bandage as it would bear. The Wound behind bled when that before was dreſt. I applied the ſaid Medicaments to that, and cauſed them to be held cloſe till they were dried on. Then we put him to bed, and kept him cool and quiet. I uſed all my endeavours for the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating his bloud, as is uſuall in ſuch caſes, and dreſt him but once in four or five days, unleſs I were neceſſitated by the burſting forth of the bloud: yet he bled at times about 16 or 17 days. His Wound by the <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the Neck healed in few days; and the other near the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> was cured by this way of Agglutination the 19. or 20. day.</p>
                     <p>A Man wounded in the Artery under the right Eye was immediately dreſt by Mr. <hi>Fawcet</hi> Chirurgeon;<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of an Artery wounded.</note> but the next day in the afternoon the bloud burſt out impetuouſly. The Wound had been made by the corner of a Trencher, and was not ſo big as a Silver-peny. I dreſt it with <hi>pulv. Galeni,</hi> and applied a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter over it made up with my common reſtrictive Powders <hi>cum album. ovi,</hi> with good Compreſſe and Bandage. The next day his Wound bled again, and upon ſtopping thereof with my finger, the bloud was obſerved to beat all along the Artery, from the Aperture to the Temporall Muſcle, with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force then is commonly ſeen in an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi> I pierced through both the Lips and Artery with a curved Needle, and by Deligation reſtrained the bleeding, then dreſſed it up with Emplaſticks as before, concluding I ſhould have very little more trouble from that Wound. But 2 or 3 days after it
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:95669:186"/>burſt out again, and in my abſence ſome other Chirurgeon was called in and dreſſed it. Afterwards, at another bleeding, Mr. <hi>Fawcet</hi> dreſt him, and at another time Mr. <hi>Arris.</hi> The Wound being thus enlarged with the crowding in of Doſſills, and lying in a very inconvenient place for Bandage, it bled of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and was dreſſed by ſuch Chirurgeons as they could meet with in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. By the frequent application of Eſcaroticks to ſtop the bleeding, his Eye was ſo much inflamed and corroded, that it was verily believed by us, that if he did recover of his Wound, yet that Eye would be loſt. But his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall bleeding thus many days had ſo exhauſted his Spirits, that there was ſmall hopes of his ſurviving it. At the laſt burſting out of this Veſſell, Mr. <hi>Ed. Molins</hi> deceaſed, Mr. <hi>Fawcet</hi> and my ſelf met together at his Chamber. We found him lying as dead with his Hand out of the Bed upon his Breaſt. We endeavoured to feel his Pulſe, but it not beating, we concluded him dead, and took the Dreſſings haſtily off the Wound. It did not bleed, though it was open. We ſuppoſed the bloud exhauſted. The Artery lay in the Wound torn by the Eſcaroticks. We took up the ends of it, and tied them, dreſſing the Wound with <hi>liniment. Arcei</hi> and a Plaiſter over it, not believing that the man would ever recover. But from that time the Bleeding of the Wound ceaſed, and it daily incarned by very common Remedies and was ſoon healed, to my admiration. He was in leſs then a month perfectly cured both of his Wound and Eye. This Patient had been ſubject to the like Bleeding formerly upon very ſmall Wounds.</p>
                     <p>A Butcher living at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was wounded in the Artery between the Thumb and Fore-finger.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of an Artery wounded.</note> After he had been dreſt 3 or 4 days by ſome of his neighbouring Chirurgeons, the Wound continuing to bleed, he came to me late one night with Doſſills crowded in it. I threw them out, and with a Needle and Thread ſtitcht up the Artery, and the Wound with it; then ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling ſome of my agglutinative Powders upon the Suture, I dreſſed it up with a reſtrictive Plaiſter and Bandage, as in the former Wounds is ſaid: and in three or four times dreſſing he was cured. But afterwards there appearing ſome Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation extraordinary under the <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> which proceeded from the too lax Incarnation of the Wound, I dreſſed him with a Pledgit dipt in a dulcified Tincture of Vitriol, with good Compreſſe and Bandage. At the next dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it was dried and ſhrivell'd, ſo that there was no more Pulſation to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>One in the <hi>New Exchange</hi> had an <hi>Aneuriſma</hi> in the Palm of his hand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the third and fourth Fingers, which at laſt broke out,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma</hi> broken open.</note> and bled at times the ſpace of 8 or 10 days. I dreſſed him with the Tincture of Vitriol above-ſaid once in 4 or 5 days, ſtopt the Bleeding, and cicatrized it firmly, ſo that there appeared not the leaſt Pulſation under it.</p>
                     <p>A ſedentary young Gentleman, of an ill Habit of body,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of a wound of the Sural Arterie.</note> was wounded by a Penknife in the inſide of the Calf of his leg into the Surall Artery. A Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon dreſſed up the Wound with Doſſills dipt in eſcaroticall Powders, <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canthum uſtum,</hi> &amp;c. with Plaiſter and Bandage, by which he ſtopt the Bleeding. The next day I was conſulted, and being informed of the Wound, and the manner of dreſſing, I deferred the Opening it, and adviſed him to keep his Bed. He did ſo, but complained then of a throbbing pain in his Wound, and was very apprehenſive of its bleeding, looking himſelf often upon the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and alarmed me by frequent meſſages. The third morning I met his Chirurgeon there, and looking upon his Leg, found the Bandage all bloudy. We took off the Dreſſings, and ſaw the bloud freſh in the Rowlers; but in taking off the Plaiſter, the Doſſills came out onely foul'd with a bloudy <hi>Sanies,</hi> as is uſuall in like Wounds after the filling them with ſuch Powders.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95669:187"/>The Wound and Parts about were inflamed and ſwelled; yet I had much adoe to diſſwade the young Chirurgeon from dreſſing it again with Eſcaroticks, though he ſaw the Accidents ariſing thereby. But at laſt I prevailed, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Wound with a Doſſill ſpred with the common Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi</hi> ſprinkled with <hi>pulv. Galeni,</hi> embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and applying <hi>emplaſt. è bolo</hi> over all with good Bandage. By this way of dreſſing he was eaſed, and the Wound at liberty to diſcharge the Sloughs and <hi>Sanies</hi> which were made, and choaked in by the former dreſſing. If it did not thus digeſt, yet I concluded that at the next dreſſing it would be in our power to lay open the Wound, and divide the Artery, without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Nervous or Tendonous bodies near it. But the next day I found the Patient unſatisfied how his Wound could cure ſo dreſt, without a Tent, and often murmuring that it would rankle; yet he continued pretty eaſie, and did not bleed during thoſe three days. The fourth day at the opening we found no Bloud but what was mixed with Matter, the Wound alſo lookt well; yet I complied with the Patient, and put in a ſhort Tent ſpred with the Digeſtive as before. The third day after we opened it, and ſaw upon the Dreſſing ſome freſh Bloud followed by a thick white Matter, as from a <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> It proceeded from an Apoſtemation made by the Eſcaroticks. The Wound thus digeſting, I left off the uſe of the Tent, and dreſſed it with a Doſſill, and by good Embrocations, Compreſſe and Bandage endeavoured the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Matter: which accordingly leſſened each dreſſing, but was not well digeſted, nor free from ſome ſmall tincture of Bloud. But this proceeded from his ill Habit of body, he being highly Scorbuticall, and ſubject to Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, loſſe of Appetite, and pituitous Swellings on his Feet. Upon which account Doctour <hi>W.</hi> was confulted, and ſomewhat relieved him. After his Wound was cured, I cauſed a ſtreight pair of Stockings to be laced on both Legs, to reſtrain the Swelling, and prevailed with him to riſe daily: and after he was able to walk, he retired into the Country, but hath not yet got off the Diſeaſe he heightned by keeping within doors with this little Wound. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Cure had been ſpeedier, if immediately at the firſt dreſſing his Leg had been bound up with Agglutinatives, and the whole committed to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>A poor fellow living in the Country was accidentally in letting bloud prickt in an Artery.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of an Artery prickt in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bloud.</note> The Arm ſwelling and growing painfull, he put himſelf into another Barber-Chirurgeon's hands, who by unfit Applications rarefied the Tumour, and made way to the Extravaſation of the bloud; which increaſing the Tumour, and rendring it ſoft, was ſuppoſed by the Barber to be a Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter. He accordingly opened it by Knife or Lancet: at which an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Flux of bloud burſt forth, to the quantity of 4 flaggons, (as they told me.) They made a ſhift to ſtop it: but the Bandage being made too hard and unequall, the Arm ſwelled, and inclined to gangrene. While this poor man lay thus afflicted, we his <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s and <hi>Royall Highneſſe</hi>'s Chirurgeons, attending the Court, viſited him, and prepared for the taking up this Artery, or, in caſe of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to cut off his Arm. The Patient being taken our of his Bed, and placed in a Chair towards the light, we took off the Dreſſings, and I viewed the Arm: where finding no Gangrene, according to the report of the Chirurgeon, but rather an <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> we made a Bandage above the Wound, to prohibit the Influx of bloud. One of the Chirurgeons making a gripe thereon, we made an Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Tumour on the inſide of his Arm, according to the length of it, over the Arterie; and after we had pulled out the coagulated bloud, and laid the Veſſell bare, we paſſed a Needle with a Ligature under the Artery, and tied it, then cut off the ends of it, and looſened the Bandage above: and ſeeing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95669:187"/>it bleed no more, we dreſſed it up with Pledgits dipt in the common Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> applying them with <hi>pulv. Galeni</hi> next the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and lightly filled up the Wound with Pledgits of the Digeſtive dipt in <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> warm; then embrocated the Arm with ſome of the ſame Oil, and laid a <hi>diachalcit.</hi> Plaiſter over the Wound and Parts about, alſo applied <hi>empl. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſi</hi> and <hi>diachalcit.</hi> over the Hand and Arm, which were oedematous. Then with Bandage we began at the Hand, and rowled up to the Wound, taking a turn or two over it, and ſo rowled up to the <hi>Axilla.</hi> He being returned again to his Bed, we placed his Hand upon his Breaſt, and felt his Pulſe beat ſtrongly in that Wriſt. At the next dreſſing we found the Tumour diſperſed, the Wound freſh, and tolerably digeſted. We then paſſed another Ligature upon the Artery above the firſt, and in pulling the firſt to divide the Artery between the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Artery broke; which was as well. We dreſt it up as before we had done, onely leaving out the Powders. At the next Opening, finding the Wound in a very good condition, the Lips of it being digeſted and contracted, we dreſſed it up with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> &amp;c. Then ſeeing it in a hopefull way of Cure, I returned to <hi>London,</hi> leaving the Patient to my Fellows, who dreſt it ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſpace of 10 days without any appearance of bloud. In ſome of their abſence the Barber-Chirurgeon dreſſed the Patient. Whether it was in wiping off the Knot, or crowding in Doſſills, but it burſt out again: yet the Artery being divided, it ſoon ſtopt by the application of <hi>Colcothar,</hi> and from that time it bled no more. The ancient way of Deligation is, as I have already ſaid, by tying it in two diſtinct places, and cutting the Artery off between: but the Patient's often fainting interrupted us in that work. And truly in this caſe, where a Barber was to be intruſted with the Cure, it had been better that the Artery had not been divided; for then it would not have been in his power to have rubb'd off the Ligature, and before the Wound could have been ready to cicatrize, the Ligature would have fallen off of it ſelf, without danger of bleeding.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Symptoms</hi> are,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> great Pain and Inflammation, alſo a contraction and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Nerve or Tendon. But if the Nerve be quite divided, the pain is little, onely a kind of <hi>Stupor</hi> or Nummedneſſe. According as the Nerve is more or leſſe conſiderable, ſo alſo the particular Part is lame more or leſſe.</p>
                     <p>The moſt frequent Wounds of Nerves,<note place="margin">Ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of bleeding not always from a prick of a Nerve or Tendon.</note> and moſt to be taken care of in Chirurgery, being Punctures, I ſhall inſtance in them, and chuſe the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which are made accidentally by letting bloud. And here by the way you muſt take notice, that, in letting bloud, ſometimes the Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens to be made, when the Skin, by reaſon of the Bandage, or Poſition of the Arm, lies equal with the Vein, yet afterwards is not ſo; or the Apertion is made too ſmall in the Skin, ſo that part of the bloud is choakt in, and lies there extravaſated, whence a ſmall <hi>Phlegmon</hi> ariſeth: or it may happen in ſome that are well let bloud, that yet through the indiſpoſition or ill Habit of body, the Part prickt feſters, (as they uſually ſay,) and groweth ſoar a day or two after, and, if neglected, may raiſe a Tumour, which lying upon the Nerve or Tendon, may at that time contract the Arm. If a Boil in a Fleſhy part be painfull, then much more theſe in the Joynts amongſt the Nerves and Tendons. Such Accidents have and will happen to all that let bloud, whether Phyſicians or Chirurgeons: which is the reaſon that ſome of our old experienced Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons did, after letting bloud, always apply a Pledgit of <hi>baſilicon</hi> upon the Aperture, with <hi>emplaſtr. diachalcith.</hi> over it, which by its digeſtive quality ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it from corrupting. But we by a contrary way, as by a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe dipt in Water, endeavour to reſtrain the flowing of the hot <hi>Serum</hi> to the Aperture; and we ſhould be laught at if we continued that old method of Dreſſing. At the time we let people bloud, they are commonly labouring under ſome great Fermentation, or apprehend it ſo: no wonder then if it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall upon the Part, where it was invited by Bandage. I have been ſent for into the Countrey to a perſon, that, after a letting bloud, was ſeized with an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> or bilious Inflammation the whole length of the Arm. The Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Vein might poſſibly be the cauſe; but that place was not afflicted at all. Dr. <hi>Ringall</hi> complained once of a Chirurgeon, who was ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable, as he ſaid, to ask five pounds for curing an Arm he had made ſoar by his letting bloud. But I hope no perſon is ſo ignorant or malicious, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſuch Accidents to a Puncture of the Nerve or Tendon.</p>
                     <p>For when they are really prickt, their Symptoms (as you may reade in all thoſe that have writ of them) are ſudden, with vehement Pain, Faintings, Convulſions, and attended with great Defluxions. They do not terminate preſently in Suppuration, but gleet, and will not yield to a ſimple anodyne Cataplaſm of White-bread and Milk.</p>
                     <p>All Wounds of the Nerves and Tendons are dangerous,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but more or leſſe according as they are of uſe. Thoſe of the Nerves are attended with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Symptoms, and ſeize the Patient more ſuddenly. But whether it be Nerve or Tendon, the tranſverſe Wound is moſt dangerous, and difficult of Cure.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> there are other conſiderations required; and in the firſt place, whether the Nerve or Tendon lie open in view, or under coverture of the Skin. If they lie covered under the Skin or <hi>Membrana adipoſa,</hi> then you ought to open the Skin, that the Medicaments may penetrate to the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nerve or Tendon. Your Medicaments proper in theſe Grievances ought to be ſuch as are of hot, dry and ſubtil parts, to conſume that Ichorous water which firſt affects them, and cauſeth the Putrefaction.

                     <p>In your application of Medicaments you muſt conſider what degree of heat and ſiccity is proper for the offended Nerve or Tendon.<note place="margin">Caution.</note> If in your uſe of theſe Medicaments your Patient feels not the heat of them, or feels it vehemently, they are not then rightly fitted: for in the former caſe they do not enough dry that <hi>Sanies;</hi> in the latter they do inflame the Part. If the Patient feel the heat moderately, the Medicine is good: but if from the uſe of the Medicine the Part itch and ſmart, and the Aperture made by Puncture gape, then the Medicament is ſtronger then it ſhould be. If the hardneſs goe off with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and the Lips of the Wound relax, 'tis a good fign. I ſhall give you one Obſervation for the farther confirmation.</p>
                     <p>A young Chirurgeon having accidentally prickt a Tendon in letting a Maid bloud in the <hi>Saphena</hi> near the Ancle, he dreſt it up with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> hot.<note place="margin">Obſervat. of a Tendon prickt.</note> Her pain increaſing, I was conſulted, and ſaw the Chirurgeon ready to apply his hot Oils: but upon ſight of the Wound, the Lips being turgid and dry, alſo the Parts about inflamed, I ſhewed him his errour, and prevailed with him to dreſſe it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> warm, and to embrocate <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> alſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>empl. diapalm.</hi> malaxed with ſome of the ſame Oil, and to forbear dreſſing it 2 or 3 days: during which ſhe was cured.

Then I ſprinkled the Powders of Myrrh, Aloes, <hi>Thus,</hi> &amp;c. upon the Suture, and applied a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi</hi> on the reſt of the Wound, with a Defenſative over all, and rowl'd it up.

                     <p>A Lady was wounded down the whole length of the Forehead to the Noſe,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of wounds in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Eye-brow.</note> alſo tranſverſe the left Eye-brow to the Temporall Muſcle; her Eye and Face were alſo much bruiſed. It happened to her travelling in a Hackney-Coach, upon the jetting whereof ſhe was thrown out of the hinder Seat againſt a Bar of Iron in the forepart of the Coach. At the firſt ſight of the Wound in her Forehead, ſeeing the Bone bare and her ſelf ſo diſturbed, I doubted whether I ſhould ſtitch it, or keep it open with Doſſills: but ſeeing no Fiſſure or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in the Bone, and conſidering the Deformity in that place would be great, I brought the Lips of the Wound cloſe together with one Stitch, and dreſſed it with Sarcoticks, reſolving, if any Symptom prognoſticated ill, to cut the Stitch, and lay it open again; but if there were none, then at the next dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to bring the Lips of the Wound nearer by dry Stitches. On the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brow I made four Stitches, at ſuch diſtance as they might be able to retain the Lips together, taking in a triangular piece of Skin that was divided by a Wound above it, which rendred it not unlike a double Hair-lip. Then I dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up the Wounds with <hi>Arceus</hi>'s Liniment and <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> with a Compreſſe dipt in Oxycrate, and made my Bandage over all. Having thus dreſt her Wounds, I cauſed ſome <hi>aq. roſ. rub. cum alb. ovi</hi> to be beaten together, and dropt in her Eye; then applied ſoft folds of Linen wet in the ſame Mixture over that diſeaſed Eye, and an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over her Cheek, forbearing the Bleeding her that night, in conſideration that ſhe had bled the ſpace of 5 miles in her retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back to <hi>London.</hi> The ſecond day after I took off the Dreſſings, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Two days after I dreſt her again, and finding that the dry Stitches kept thoſe Lips of the Wound cloſe together, I cut off the other, and dreſt her with ſarcotick Powders, which ſupplied the place of Epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loticks; and that morning I let her bloud in the Arm about ten ounces, and purged her the day after with <hi>infuſ. ſenae, rhab.</hi> &amp;c. By this the Defluxion was removed, and in the ſpace of ſeven days the Wounds were all perfectly cured, and ſhe returned back the eighth day.</p>
                     <p>A Servant of a Nobleman was wounded on the right Cheek over the <hi>Os zygoma,</hi>

In cleanſing of the Wound, I felt a piece of that Bone, which had been cut off by a ſlanting blow: it hung onely by ſome fleſhy Fibres in the Wound. I took it out, and, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the part would not well admit of Bandage, I made two Stitches, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Lips of the Wound even together, then ſprinkled the Suture with ſarcotick Powders, and dreſt it up as the former. The third day after, taking off Dreſſings, and finding his Wound agglutinated, I cut out the Stitches, and dreſt him with ſome of the ſame Agglutinatives as before. Two days after, dreſſing him again, I found his Wound perfectly cured.</p>

One of our men beat him down, and fell with him; then kneeling upon his Breaſt, and holding his Head down, he drew out a Knife ſticking in his Saſh, and cut him from the Ear towards the Mouth, then from the <hi>Os zygoma</hi> to the neather Jaw. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you ſhall wear a Croſs, that the Devill do not carry you away.</hi> I was ſent for from the next houſe as a friend to that Religion, and ſtitcht the Lips of the Wound cloſe together; then ſprinkling them with a little <hi>pulv.

The next morning he was let bloud, and the third day after I took off the Dreſſings, and finding the Wound as it were agglutinated in the Slits, I cut out ſome of the Stitches, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled the Wound as at firſt, and dreſt him up with Sarcoticks, with Compreſſe and Bandage. The ſecond day after I dreſt him again, and cut out the remaining Stit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and in a dreſſing or two more cured him. This being the work of Nature, who rarely faileth in acting her part, if we perform ours, in retaining the Lips cloſe together, and defending them from Fluxion. The Patient was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his Cure, though there remained ſome marks of a Croſs.

                     <p>WOunds penetrating the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> and <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> require to be ſtitched cloſe, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> where the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and <hi>Saliva</hi> ſo continually preſſeth into it. Therefore if your Stitches ſlacken before the internall Wound be agglutinated, you ought to make new Stitches, or paſſe Needles or Pins through the Lips of the Wound, and with ſtrong Thread twiſted about them, as in a Hair-lip, keep them cloſe together, till the Wound be united. During which, dreſs it up with Agglutinatives, and preſcribe a thin Diet: ſo ſhall you cure the Wound in few days, when as otherwiſe obſerve what followeth.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about ſix years of age, playing with a wooden Dagger,<note place="margin">Obſervat. of a wound in the Gullet.</note> fell upon it, and wounded himſelf into the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> or Gullet, ſo as his <hi>Saliva</hi> froathed out of the Wound. I being fetched, ſtitched up the Wound, and applied Aſtringents, with Compreſſe and retentive Bandage, then put him into bed, and let him bloud in the Arm, adviſing a Lambative of <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum. ovor. rec. cum ſacchar. alb.</hi> to be taken as neceſſity ſhould require, with directions to abſtain from all other Suſtenance till the next morning. At which time viſiting him again, I was told their Chirurgeon had taken off my Dreſſings, cut off the Stitches, and given a greater liberty in Diet. I wondered what peculiar Art he had in curing that Wound. But about a month after I was informed, he had been foiled in the Cure, and had left it to Nature; and that the Child was fed with Pudding, and ſuch ſoft Food, part whereof came daily out at his Wound.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Wounds of the Lims.</head>
                     <p>ONE of our Mariners in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a puncture of the Arm.</note> fighting on ſhoar, was thruſt with a Rapier into the outſide of the Arm nigh the <hi>Biceps.</hi> A Chirurgeon in the Town, ſeeing him bleed much, ſtitcht the Wound cloſe, and applied his Reſtrictives, rowling up the Part well. After three or four days, the Patient came aboard, and, being in pain, deſired me to dreſs him. The Arm being ſwelled and inflamed, I cut the Stitches open, and gave vent to a bloudy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> after which followed a digeſted Matter. Finding by ſearch with my Probe the Wound wanted little of paſſing through, I embrocated and dreſt it up with a ſhort Tent armed with my common Digeſtive, and endeavoured by good Bandage to cure it. But it not yielding thereto, I paſſed a Seton-needle through, diſcharging the Matter downward; and after that Apertion was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, I dilated it, and kept a Tent there a few days; during which the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Wound healed up: and the Wound below digeſting well, and the Matter daily leſſening, I alſo healed that up. This I inſert, to ſhew you that ſuch Wounds ought not to be ſtitcht, but dreſt up with Aſtringents, Compreſſe and Bandage: for ſo theſe Wounds in a good Habit of body, with Compreſſe and Bandage, do frequently agglutinate in a few days; whereas dreſt by Tents they are of longer continuance, and rendered at laſt difficult of Cure.</p>
                     <p>While I was in the <hi>King</hi>'s Service in the time of the War in the Weſt-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a wound in the Thigh.</note> I was fetched to Captain <hi>M.</hi> who in fighting a Duell was run through the Thigh with a broad Sword: I was alſo ſent for at the ſame time to the other. I haſtily dreſt this Officer's Thigh with Pledgits ſpred with Sarcoticks, and ſome aſtringent Powders mixt with the Whites of eggs, applying them over both the Orifices, and bringing the Lips of them cloſe, with Compreſſe and Bandage, and ſo left him to be by his Servants put to bed. From thence I went to dreſs the other, who had many little Wounds, on his Fingers, Hands, and Head. At my return I viſited my former Patient, whom I found in his bed with little pain. The ſecond day after I attended him, and finding all in good temper, without pain or ſwelling, I dreſt the Wounds as I had done before, there being good ſigns that they would heal up by Agglutination; for there was little either of Matter, Pain, or Swelling. If it had appeared inflamed with Tumour or Pain, I ought then to have dilated the Orifice moſt diſtempered; and if they had both ſuffered, I might have kept them both open with ſmall ſhort Tents ſpred with the common Digeſtives, and have let him bloud, and proceeded as in a Body ill habited: but there was no need; there onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a quiet poſition of the Part, which he ſubmitted to, and was happily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in 7 or 8 days. This was really performed by the Balſam of his bloud, I neither bleeding nor purging him in the time of his Cure.</p>
                     <p>A fat Gentleman came from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> wounded in the Thigh with a Tuck. It was much inflamed,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a wound in the Thigh.</note> by reaſon of the Tent in it, which was very long; his young Chirurgeon ſuppoſing the Wound could not be cured unleſs the Tent reached to the bottom of it. I threw out the Tent, and dreſſed the Wound
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95669:191"/>with a Pledgit of <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> embrocated it with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> then let him bloud. He being feveriſh, I alſo preſcribed a Clyſter, and ſent him an Anodyne draught to diſpoſe him to reſt that night. The next day I found him in good temper, and his Wound inclined to heal. I dreſſed it as the day before, and adviſed him to keep his bed three or four days. About two days after I viſited him again, and taking off the Dreſſings, ſaw his Wound perfectly cured: ſo it continued, and he walked abroad the next day.</p>
                     <p>A perſon was wounded in the inſide of the Arm,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a wound in the Arm.</note> the Sword paſſing over the Joint ſlanting to the outſide of the Arm. He was firſt dreſt by a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon near the place where he was hurt, and had bled much. The next day he complaining of pain, I opened the Wound, and found it tented at both Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the Arm ſwelled, and a little diſturbed; as Wounds in that place are ſubject to be, when the bloud is ſhut in by Tents, and not dreſt rationally by Aſtringents and good Bandage. The Swelling was moſt between the two Orifices, and appeared afterwards to be the bloud choaked in by the ſtreightneſs of the Bandage, and was not likely to yield otherwiſe then by Suppuration. I fomented the wounded Member with Diſcutients, and kept both the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices open with ſmall Tents dipt in the common Digeſtive, embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; gutt. aliquot aceti,</hi> and applying over all <hi>empl. è bolo.</hi> The third dreſſing there appeared bloud from that Orifice in the inſide of the Arm. I filled it with Praecipitate upon a Doſſill, and dreſt the Wounds up as before; then acquainted the Patient with my thoughts of Opening the Swelling between the two Orifices, there being no likelihood the Matter could diſcharge it ſelf by either of them, yet it was not ſafe to heal them up. Wherefore I opened that Tumour lying between them by a little Cauſtick, and diſcharged a grumous bloud with a corrupt <hi>Serum.</hi> From that time I left off the uſe of Tents, and healed that Wound up in four or five days: and as the Eſcar ſeparated, the Ulcer digeſted, and I cured that latter Opening ſoon after. That the Bone was bare under the Tumour, may I ſuppoſe yet be felt, from the adheſion of the muſculous Fleſh to it.</p>
                     <p>A perſon was wounded in the outſide of the right Leg below the Gartering-place,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of a wound in the Leg.</note> the Wound running upward. After 6 weeks dreſſing by the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chirurgeons, the Wound being much diſturbed by a Flux of Humours, I was conſulted, and found it ſinuous (ſome two inches) upward, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Inflammation and Tumour. The Small of the Leg and Foot were oedematous, and the whole Member ſo weakned by the Influx, that it was neither able to aſſimilate its Aliment, nor yet to reſiſt the Crudities that fell upon it, and ſo was like to be of difficult Cure. In order to which I laid open part of the <hi>Sinus</hi> by Inciſion, and deterged the Wound with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> mixt with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and applying <hi>cerat. Galeni</hi> over the inflamed Tumour. I fomented the oedematous Tumour with a Decoction of <hi>abſinth. ſcord. flor. ſambuci, cham. roſ. rubr. bacc. myrtill. &amp; balanſt.</hi> and applied over the Swelling a Mixture of <hi>empl. diachalcit. &amp; ſtict. Paracelſi,</hi> with good Bandage, not renewing thoſe Dreſſings more then once a week, to give a breathing to it. By the foreſaid method of dreſſing, that part of the Wound which I had laid open deterged, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Tumour remitted. I afterwards divided the remaining <hi>Sinus,</hi> and deterged it as the former, and with <hi>unguent. diapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pholyg.</hi> &amp;c. cicatrized it, by the help of a laced Stocking, in the ſpace of about a month. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been long kept in his Chamber by his Wound, and now ſuppoſing himſelf well, he rid to his Country-houſe, (unknown to me:) but that night his Leg ſwelled much, and the <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> being ſcarce confirmed, brake out
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95669:192"/>again; upon ſight whereof he returned back the next day, and ſent for me. His Leg being inflamed, and the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> fretted quite off, I fomented the Member <hi>cum decoct. malvar. violar. plantag. ſolani, &amp; flor. roſ. rub.</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the application of <hi>baſilicon,</hi> &amp;c. to digeſt it: but it not yielding thereto, I applied Refrigerants on the externall Parts, and a fine Lawn wet in a Solution of <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſ.</hi> made in <hi>decoct. plantag. equiſeti,</hi> &amp;c. over the Exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, alſo <hi>unguent. alb. camph.</hi> over the Lawn, upon Pledgits ſomewhat diſtant from one another, leſt the Matter ſhould be ſhut in by the adheſion of them, and fret the <hi>Cuticula</hi> more off. Thus I dreſſed it twice aday, he keeping his Leg upon his bed, to prevent Defluxion. By this method the heat and acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Humour being mitigated, I applied over the Lawn Epuloticks more drying, <hi>viz. pulv. corn. cerv. uſti,</hi> &amp;c. and at laſt with much difficulty ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrized the Ulceration: whereas if this Wound had been treated methodically in its recency, it might poſſibly have been cured in few days by Agglutination.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Wounds of the Breaſt.</head>
                     <p>WOunds of the Breaſt are penetrating, or not. If they do penetrate, then we are to conſider the depth; whether it be onely between the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> in the hollow Cavity of that, in the lower part of the Breaſt; or whether it penetrate into the Cavities of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> or what the Parts are that be hurt. How the Breaſt is circumſcribed, with the Symptoms of each Part when hurt, you may find in the following Diſcourſe of <hi>Gun-ſhot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of Wounds penetrating are diſcovered by the proportion of the Searching-candle or Probe,<note place="margin">Signs of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating wounds.</note> which enters into the Cavity. You may alſo perceive when it penetrates the Cavities of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> by laying a Down-feather upon the Wound, or by holding a lighted Candle near it, the Patient holding his breath the whilſt. In this caſe the Wind (or Air) will move the Feather or Flame; if it do not blow away the one, and extinguiſh the other. The Air alſo makes a noiſe in its paſſing forth. Sometimes it is diſcovered by the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bloud diſcharged by the Wound or Mouth, or both, with Difficulty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>Wounds in the hinder part of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are reckoned dangerous,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Nerves and Tendons; and if they penetrate that way, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger from the great Veſſells of bloud, which are nearer to the Weapon in this caſe then in thoſe Wounds which are made forward: yet all Wounds in the Breaſt are dangerous, by reaſon of the continuall motion of the Lungs, and of the bloud that falls down on the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and corrupts it. If the Lungs be wounded deep amongſt the great Veſſells, though they eſcape the firſt nine days, yet they commonly terminate in a <hi>Phthiſis,</hi> or <hi>Fiſtula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Wound in the externall part of the Breaſt is cured as a Simple Wound. If it penetrate,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> you are to endeavour firſt the reſtraining the bloud; then that the extravaſated bloud be diſcharged: and that either by the Mouth, by Expectoration; or by the Wound; or by Urine. The way by Urine <hi>Fabr,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95669:192"/>ab Aquapend.</hi> ſays is by a branch of the <hi>Azygos,</hi> which, ſaith he, paſſeth near the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> by the Spine, to the Emulgents. Thoſe that own the Circulation will hardly allow of his <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> however, if the matter of fact be true, that there is ſometimes a diſcharge by Urine, which I confeſs I have not yet obſerved in my own practice, it will be reaſonable to propoſe, as he doth, in this caſe, Diureticks, as <hi>decoct. capill. Veneris, polytrich. rad. petroſelin. beton. apii, foeniculi, aſparagi;</hi> alſo Ptiſans, with <hi>ol. ſulphur. vitriol.</hi> Barly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cream, Emulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to contemperate the bloud. The Ancients gave <hi>acetum</hi> with warm Water to reſtrain the preſent Flux, and to diſſolve the concreted bloud.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is by Expectoration; and thereto ſerve <hi>decoct. pectorale.</hi> Lohochs, <hi>ſyr. capill. Ven. jajub. glycyrrhiz. oxymel,</hi> &amp;c. whereof the <hi>Pharmacopoeia Lond.</hi> is full. This I have mentioned for their ſakes who cannot have a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. But here I leave this work to them, thoſe Cures conſiſting much in their well ordering and preſcribing internall Remedies; contenting my ſelf in the Dreſſing of the Wound as it appertains to Chirurgery.<note place="margin">Whether the wound is to be kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, or not.</note> In the treating of which there is a Queſtion, whether the Wound ſhould be kept open, or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated. They that are for a ſpeedy Agglutination, do urge it, leſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Air corrupt the Parts within, and the heat expire. They that propoſe the keeping them open, do deſign thereby a readier diſcharge of Matter. For, ſaith <hi>Aquapendent.</hi> if the Matter be to be diſcharged by Urine, it muſt paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> then into the Vein <hi>Azygos,</hi> ſo into the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, then to the Kidneys, and through the Ureters and Bladder: if by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, then it muſt alſo firſt paſs into the ſubſtance of the Lungs, then into the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi> or Weaſand, and from thence be coughed up, and ſpit out by the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>In my practice, in theſe Wounds of the Breaſt, I conſider the Wound,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> how it is capable of diſcharging the extravaſated Bloud and Matter. If it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſo, that the Bloud or Matter may be thereby diſcharged, then it is to be kept open, the welfare of the Patient depending mainly upon the well dreſſing and governing it: but if it do not lie well for Evacuation of that extravaſated Bloud, then it may doe hurt, and ſo ought to be healed up.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of about 23 years of age, of a good Habit of body,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wound of the Breaſt.</note> being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Breaſt, there followed immediately a great effuſion of Bloud, almoſt to the exhauſting of his Spirits. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Chirurgeon and my ſelf were preſently ſent for. We found him lodged in an Inne near <hi>Fox-ball,</hi> and viewed his Wound. It was four fingers above the <hi>Cartilago euſiformis,</hi> a little to the left ſide: he had a ſmall Pulſe, and fainted often. Dr. <hi>Wedderborn</hi> and Dr. <hi>Will. Denton</hi> came in while we were providing Dreſſings. The Wound was large and penetrating. We made a ſoft Tent, with a Thread faſtened to it;<note place="margin">How to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tents in penetrating wounds of the Breaſt.</note> which in theſe Wounds you muſt be ſure to doe, leſt you looſe it in the Body. This Tent we dipt in a Mixture of Powder compoſed of <hi>bol. Armen. ſang. dracon. thus, maſtich.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum albumine ovi,</hi> and applied over it a Pledgit ſpred with the ſame, alſo <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> with convenient Bandage. The Phyſicians preſcribed internally ſuch things as reſtrained the Bleeding, and were proper to reſolve the concreted bloud, and withall to relieve his fainting Spirits. That night he reſted ill. The next day when we met, ſeeing him labour under great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, with pain above the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> his Pulſe quick, little Urine, and that high-coloured, we agreed he ſhould be let bloud preſently; which was done accordingly in the left Arm. The bloud flowing with a quick ſtream, we took away about 6 or 7 ounces, a meer <hi>Serum:</hi> but the Patient
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95669:193"/>was relieved by it. We then took off our Dreſſings, to look upon the Wound, whereupon we found ſome Bloud and <hi>Sanies</hi> diſcharged. We dreſt him with <hi>terebinth. lot. in ſucco lamii,</hi> adding ſome of the former Powders <hi>cum vitell. ovi</hi> upon a Tent as before, with a Plaiſter and Bandage over it. Thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to dreſs him untill we ſaw the Bleeding ceaſe. After which there was nothing for us to doe, but to further the diſcharge of Matter from within, by keeping the Wound open untill it leſſened, and the ill Symptoms went off: the caſting in of liquid Medicaments, which are not eaſily to be gotten out again, being very deſtructive. Therefore we diligently attended in aſſiſting Nature, by keeping a way open for the evacuation of what was extravaſated and corrupted within the Cavity, committing the Cure to her; who indeed acted her part ſo well, that in few days the Wound agglutinated within: and we thereupon leaving off the uſe of the Tent, cured the externall Wound in few weeks by the common Sarcoticks, leaving him in perfect health, which he yet enjoyeth.</p>
                     <p>Another perſon was wounded into the Breaſt below the fourth Rib on the right ſide.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a wound in the right Breaſt.</note> He coughed up much bloud at times. Sr. <hi>Fra. Pruj.</hi> was his Phyſician; who preſcribed him Ptiſans, pectorall Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which and frequent Phlebotomy the Symptoms went off. After the Wound digeſted, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient rambled abroad, and was cured by ſuch Dreſſings as I left for him at his Chamber, I ſeeing him no more untill he was wounded again.</p>
                     <p>Another was wounded in the right Breaſt,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a wound in the right Breaſt.</note> coughing up much bloud, with great pain and Difficulty of breathing. I took away ten ounces of bloud preſently, and ordered him (it being then night) ſome <hi>ſyrup. de meconio &amp; jujub.</hi> in a Draught of <hi>aq. papaver.</hi> with a few drops <hi>ſpir. ſulphuris.</hi> He ſlept well that night, and againſt the morning he had <hi>decoct. pectoral. com.</hi> (the hotter Herbs left out,) ſweetened with <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſicc. &amp; jujub.</hi> of which he drank in the morning, and at other times as he liſted. By his diſorder he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently relapſed, and coughed up bloud at times: I let him bloud as often, and kept his Wound open and digeſted. But he relapſing again, I began to be ſick of him, and dealt with him to ſend for a Phyſician. Sr. <hi>Ed. Graves</hi> was conſulted, who ſaw his Wound almoſt cured. We repeated Venaſection; and from that time he recovered, and continued well.</p>
                     <p>A Footman was wounded into the left Side:<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a wound in the left Side.</note> he cought bloud, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged much by the Wound. A Servant of mine dreſſed him with a Tent, by which the Bleeding was ſtopt from flowing thereout: and by letting him bloud in the Arm, the Coughing of bloud was checked. The other Symptoms were afterward removed by Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi>'s Preſcriptions. Some few days after, a Tumour ariſing about the Wound, I gave him a viſit, and felt the ſwelled Parts crackle under my fingers. Concluding it Wind got out from the Cavity within the <hi>Thorax,</hi> I made an Inciſion into the Swelling about an inch long, by which the Wind was diſcharged. We digeſted the Wound <hi>cum terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. and kept it open two or three Dreſſings, till the Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration into the Breaſt was incarned; then leſſened the Doſſill, and healed it as in the former Obſervations hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 23 years of age,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of wounds in the Breaſt and right Arm.</note> of a full Body, was wounded in the Breaſt and right Arm. He was carried into the next houſe, and dreſſed by a <hi>French</hi> Chirurgeon. The next morning I found him much afflicted with a Colick and <hi>Dyſuria.</hi> Theſe Symptoms happening thus upon his Wounds, gave ſome occaſion to think they proceeded from the Wound inflicted on the Breaſt; but were indeed the effects of his ill Habit of body and manner of living; for he had been a Good fellow, and at that time over-warmed with Drink, and had layn upon a Pallet that night in a cold Chamber, which together
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95669:193"/>ſeemed cauſe ſufficient for his complaint: however Bleeding was repeated. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations were alſo applied to the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> Clyſters adminiſtred, and all things done which were proper in ſuch caſes; Purging excepted, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Wounds: the one whereof was ſaid to be on the Region of the Heart, and the other in the Artery of the Arm. The third day after we prepared to dreſs his Wounds, and found the one, lying upon the <hi>Sternon,</hi> penetrating under the Skin to the <hi>Cartilago enſiformis,</hi> whereout we pull'd a Tent near two inches long, and proportionably big. The other was a Puncture on the outſide of the Arm, with a Tent crowded into it. I dreſſed this latter Wound with a Pledgit ſpred with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. &amp; empl. è bolo,</hi> and in two or three dreſſings cured it. To the other I applied ſome of the ſame Digeſtive upon a ſmall Tent; and having embrocated the adjacent Parts with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> I uſed <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with Compreſſe and Bandage, and deſigned that way to cure it. But the <hi>Sinus</hi> being depending, and the Wound diſturbed by the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable great Tent, hindered the Agglutination: wherefore after a dreſſing or two I ſnipt it open with a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, and cured it by incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Wounds appearing ſo inconſiderable, the Patient was purged, and the <hi>Dyſuria</hi> remitted: but a few hours after he was ſeized with a pain in his left Hip, for which he was again let bloud, Plaiſters were applied, and Purging repeated. But after all, a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> happened, which freed him of the Sciatick pain. Being thus relieved, he obſerved no longer the ſtrict Rules preſcribed him, but took the liberty to eat and drink as he liſted, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Recovery to that.</p>
                     <p>A perſon run through the Body the breadth of three fingers under the right Clavicle, and out below the <hi>Scapula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of a wound through the Body.</note> was firſt dreſt by a Chirurgeon near the place where he was wounded. I came ſome hours after, and found him in bed faint and weak, but without Pain or Difficulty of breathing. The next day I met Dr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> Phyſician, and Mr. <hi>Shocque</hi> Chirurgeon to his Highneſs Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi> The Patient had reſted very ill the preceding night, his Wound in his Back had bled very much, even quite through the Bed; he had alſo fouled many Napkins in coughing up Bloud. We took the Dreſſings off the Wound in his Breaſt, from whence there had been ſome bloud diſcharged, and more came out ſoon after. I dreſt up the Wound with a ſhort Tent dipt in a little <hi>terebinth. cum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. volatili,</hi> and a few of our agglutinative Powders mixed with the Yolk of an egg, and applied <hi>empl. diachalcith.</hi> over it. The other Wound under the <hi>Scapula</hi> was painfull, but ſo ſmall, that it was not reaſonable in our judgments to keep it open. We therefore laid a Pledgit of the ſame Mixture with a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon that, and from that time dreſt it no more; but dreſſed the Wound in his Breaſt daily, and repeated Venaeſection as occaſion offered. The third day he cought up bloud, and ſome little iſſued from his Wound that day and the next. Four or five days after I waited upon him to his Lodgings in <hi>London:</hi> by the way he cought ſome bloud, and ſo more or leſs day and night; but by the care of his Phyſicians it leſſened daily, and his Wound being better digeſted, I kept the Orifice open by a ſhort hollow Tent made of a Sparadrope, which was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>reſin. pin. gum. ammoniac. bdellium, galban. terebinth. &amp; cera,</hi> with <hi>pulv. ireos,</hi> dipping it in a little <hi>mel roſ.</hi> This way of dreſſing I continued untill the coughing of bloud diminiſhed, from 12 Napkins in a day and night to 10, 8, 7, 4, 2, 1; yea to 1 in a week. After I ſaw no bloud one way or other, nor any Symptom of ill, I deſired his Phyſicians and others might be conſulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſeverally; and having all their poſitive judgments for throwing out the Tent, and healing up the Wound, I did ſo, and in a week more cured him. Five or ſix days after he ſent me his thanks by his Servant: after which I made him a viſit, and there met Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who inquiring of me whether
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95669:194"/>his Wounds were cured, I deſired the Patient that he would ſhew the Doctour whether they were or not. He preſently ſtript himſelf of his Shirt, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctour, who both ſaw and felt the <hi>Cicatrices,</hi> and replied, They are well.</p>
                     <p>A Young man wounded in the Breaſt,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of a wound in the Breaſt.</note> labouring under very great Pain and Difficulty of breathing, with a Cough, ſent for me late one night, and ſhewed me ſome little bloud he had then cought up. He had been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the night before by a man ſtanding at a Door ſome ſteps higher then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were over him, thruſting his Rapier into his Breaſt, within two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth of the right Clavicle, downward into the Lungs. The Patient ran into that Houſe bleeding much, and was ſeized with ſuch Difficulty of breathing, that he was forced to ſtretch his Arms at length over his Head, without which doing he could not breath. He had been let bloud twice, and preſcribed Ptiſans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for all this he was very little relieved. I preſently let him bloud about ten ounces, and ordered the Apothecary to give him a draught of <hi>aq. papaver. cum ſyr. de meconio &amp; de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> with a little <hi>aq. Saxoniae frigid.</hi> and againſt the next morning appointed them to ſend for a Phyſician to meet me. They did ſo. When I came in the morning, I found the Patient marvellouſly relieved, and reſolved to remove (he being then in <hi>Sctoland-yard</hi>) to his Lodging in <hi>Wild-ſtreet.</hi> In the preſence of his Phyſician Dr. <hi>St.</hi> I took off the Dreſſings, found his Wound ſmall, and healed up within, but not cicatrized: which if it had, yet the Wound within was ſo much below this without, that it was not capable of diſcharging the Matter, and ſo not worth my attendance,, their Cure indeed conſiſting in internall Preſcriptions. However he continued me with his Phyſician, and we bled him again, taking away about ℥viij. of bloud, and proceeded in the method of Cure uſuall in ſuch caſes. That afternoon the Patient, unknown to me, purſued his intention of removing to his old Lodging in <hi>Wild-ſtreet,</hi> where going up three pair of Stairs to his Chamber, he relapſt into the former Difficultie of breathing, with pain, and cought much bloud. The morning after we met there together again. The Patient ſeemed to us quite ſpent, labouring under great oppreſſion; and by his pains about the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and Back there was ſuſpicion of extravaſated Bloud. We bled him ſome 4 or 5 ounces more, and repeated Embrocations, Lohochs, pectorall Decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and got off this difficulty in 5 or 6 days: then I left him. But after that by diſorder he relapſed again, yet was freed again the ſame way by his Phyſician, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be hang'd at laſt.</p>
                     <p>Of all theſe wounded Patients,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation concerning the diſcharge of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the Breaſt by Urine.</note> and many more I have helpt to cure, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any that I could ſay paſſed their Diſeaſe by Urine, nor many of them that vented their Urine well during the time of their lying under theſe Wounds; nor have I often ſeen them who recover expectorate any ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Matter, as might be thought to proceed from the great quantity of Bloud extravaſated. They cought freſh bloud moſt of them, like to what they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from their Wounds, but more florid.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Wounds of the Belly.</head>
                     <p>WE ſhall now ſay ſomewhat of the Wounds of the <hi>Belly:</hi> the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof you will find ſet down in the Diſcourſe of <hi>Gun-ſhot-wounds,</hi> with the Symptoms that attend the Wounds of each particular Part that ſhall happen to be hurt in it.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Belly either penetrate, or not.<note place="margin">Difference.</note> The Wounds not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are ſuch as reach no farther inward then to the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> If the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> be alſo cut through, it is reckoned a penetrating Wound: in which caſe, if the Wound be large, the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Inteſtines ſlip out. Theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Wounds are alſo frequently accompanied with Hurt of ſome of the contained Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Inteſtines, Stomack, Liver, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Penetration be large,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> it is diſcovered by the thruſting out of the Kell or Gut. If the Wound be ſmall, you muſt ſearch it with your Probe. What internall <hi>Viſcera</hi> are wounded, may be gueſſed by the externall Part hurt, but more certainly by their peculiar Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>Wounds not penetrating are without danger.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> Thoſe in the middle of the Belly are worſt, by reaſon of the Nervous body that lieth there, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more painfull to be ſtitched, and difficulter of Cure, by reaſon of the Inteſtines and Kell preſſing moſt upon that Part. If any of the internall <hi>Viſcera</hi> be hurt, the danger is great, all ſuch caſes being accounted mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                     <p>Wounds not penetrating are cured as other Wounds of the Fleſh:<note place="margin">Cure.</note> But thoſe which do penetrate require other manner of handling. If the Inteſtines or <hi>Omentum</hi> do thruſt out, you muſt ſpeedily reduce them, leſt the former inflate, or the latter over-cool and corrupt. But if the Gut be ſo puft out that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return it in, you ought to foment it with warm Water, Red wine, or ſome diſcutient Decoction <hi>ex ſummit. origan. puleg. fol. beton. ſalviae, flor. cham. ſem. anethi, foenic. dulc. aniſ.</hi> &amp;c. If by ſuch means you cannot reduce it, you muſt inlarge the Wound by Inciſion, and reſtore it to its place.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Omentum</hi> be ſlipt out and tainted by the Air, make a Ligature above the ſolid part, and cut it off; then ſtitch up the Wound, leaving the ends of the Ligature hanging out of it to caſt off. But if it be freſh and warm, reduce it with your fingers. Authours have propoſed ſeverall ways of Stitching theſe Wounds, which I ſhall not trouble you with; but adviſe you to make your Stitches ſo deep, that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> may be united with the Fleſh: for if you fail therein, a <hi>Hernia</hi> muſt neceſſarily ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>If the penetrating Wound be ſo ſmall that neither <hi>Omentum</hi> nor Inteſtine ſlip out, (as it frequently happens when they are inflicted by Tuck or Rapier,) you may then conſider what Symptoms there are of the internall <hi>Viſcera</hi> hurt: and if there be neither Inflation of the Belly, Colick, Vomiting, or ought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary by Urine or Stool, you may conclude all well; and being ſo, your beſt way will be to heal up the Wound by Agglutination: for by dreſſing it with Tents, you may cauſe diſturbance; and by expoſing it to the externall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95669:195"/>Air, Putrefaction, Colick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may enſue. Therefore I think it neceſſary that theſe Wounds be healed with all expedition, and that the Patient do keep his Bed the while: for in ſitting up, the weight of the Bowells will ſtretch the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and make way through it. And though the externall Wound in the Skin do not yield them paſſage, yet they will ſo neſt themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> as to make a <hi>Hernia.</hi> To prevent which, you ought to haſten the Cure, and not onely to keep the Patient in Bed, but to make good Compreſſion upon the Wounds, that the Parts may unite while they are recent.</p>
                     <p>If in ſuch a penetrating Wound the Small guts be wounded, the vehement Pain, continuall Vomiting of Choler, and dejection of Chyle by the Wound, will diſcover it: but in that caſe, the keeping of it open to ſeek the Inteſtine will be a hard task; and when you have found it, what will it ſignify, but to increaſe the Accidents? Therefore it will be better to follow the method of the Ancients, to embrocate all the Region of the Belly with <hi>ol. maſtich. &amp; lumbric.</hi> to dreſs the Wound with Sarcoticks, and to keep it cloſe and warm with Compreſſe and Bandage. But if the great Inteſtines be wounded, and the Excrements diſcharge that way, it may be reaſonable to lay open the Wound, and ſtitch the Gut with the Glovers Stitch, ſprinkling it with ſome of the aforeſaid Agglutinatives; and reducing it back, ſtitch up the externall Wound of the Belly, as hath been ſaid. In all theſe Wounds Venaeſection is neceſſary, and may be repeated as occaſion ſhall offer. Regulation in Diet ought to be with great moderation. Clyſters may be adminiſtred after the ſecond day of Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or Veal broth wherein Barly hath been boiled: to which may be added Yolks of eggs, <hi>mel comm.</hi> or Sugar of red Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo Internalls may be preſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> Vulnerary decoctions of <hi>fol. plantag. equiſeti, pimpinell. piloſell. rad. conſolid.</hi> to which may be added <hi>conſ. roſ. rub. conſ. cydonior. Bolus's</hi> may be alſo proper of <hi>ſpecies diatragacanth.</hi> with Balſamicks. Wounds of the Liver, Spleen, and other <hi>Viſcera,</hi> require to be treated much after the ſame manner by Internalls. They ought more eſpecially to be kept open, either for the dreſſing them, or for the diſcharge of Matter. Alſo Cataplaſms may be applied <hi>ex far. hord. fabar. flor. roſ. rub. coct. cum hydromel.</hi> For farther ſatisfaction therein, I refer you to <hi>Wounds made by Gun-ſhot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Man was brought to <hi>Lambeth</hi> wounded tranſverſe the Belly a little below the Navell on the left ſide;<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a wound in the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Omentum</hi> and Inteſtines were thruſt out, and kept cloſe to the Wound with a Handkerchief in his hand. The <hi>Omentum</hi> was much out; but not being altered by the Air, I cauſed warm Cloaths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be held upon them very cloſe, and the Patient to be placed low with his Head, and his Hips raiſed up: then by the help of his Friend raiſing them yet higher, and ſhaking his Body, I reduced them. After which, they having laid him down with his Hips raiſed, and his Body ſomewhat declining to the right Side, my Aſſiſtent preſſing with his hands ſomething above the Wound, (by which the Lips of it were a little turned upward, and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> down,) I prepared to ſtitch the Wound with a ſtrong Needle ſomewhat curved at the point, threaded proportionably, taking hold of the lower Lip; and paſſed my Needle firſt through the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The manner of ſowing the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum</hi> in this caſe.</note> and then to the oppoſite ſide, through the Fleſh and Skin, leaving the <hi>Peritonaeum;</hi> and ſo along, taking it up on one ſide, and leaving it on the other, till I had ſowed up the Wound. Then I pull'd the Stitches as cloſe together as I could, and faſtened my Thread. The Wound thus ſtitcht, I ſprinkled the Stitches with <hi>pulv. aloes, colophoniae, ſang. dracon. maſtich.</hi> &amp;c. and applied Sarcoticks with a Plaiſter over all, made up of ſome of the aforeſaid Powders <hi>cum album. ovi,</hi> and with Compreſſe and a ſtrong
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:95669:195"/>Towell braced them all faſt. After a while I let him bloud, and ordered him to lie quiet upon the ſound Side, and to keep his body ſoluble by Clyſters, alſo to be moderate in eating and drinking. I dreſt him after the ſame manner every other day; and when the Wound ſeemed to be cicatrized, and that my Stitches began to fret, I cut them out the eighth or ninth day; but continued the uſe of Sarcoticks till it was firmly cicatrized.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Wounds are not ſubject to great Inflammation or Defluxion; but by reaſon of the fatneſs and thickneſs of the Lips, and by preſſing of the Kell and Guts, the ſtitching of the Belly is a troubleſome work: and yet if the Wounds be not ſo ſtitched that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and Fleſhy parts may unite together, a <hi>Hernia</hi> will follow, as I told you, for the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> bears a great ſtreſs. Therefore you muſt be ſure to take good hold with your Stitches: and if you doubt their holding, make dry Stitches over them, with good Bandage.</p>
                     <p>A Man was wounded with a Rapier into the Belly through the right <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondrium</hi> out by the Back.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a wound in the Belly.</note> I conſidered the Wound, and ſaw the Orifices were ſmall, and little advantage to be made by keeping them open: yet I put in two ſmall Tents dipt in a little Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitell. ovi,</hi> and dreſt them up with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> and Bandage, adviſing him to keep his bed and be quiet. I alſo preſcribed <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>ſyr. de meconio</hi> mixt in a draught of <hi>aq. papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> to take that night. The next morning I found him hot, and his Pulſe a little diſturbed, but without any Symptoms of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> wounded;<note place="margin">Signs of the inward <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera</hi> hurt by a wound of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                        </note> neither Tenſion of the Belly, Colick, Vomiting, or ought extraordinary by Urine or Stool: however I let him bloud about 10 ounces, directing him a Clyſter of Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be adminiſtred that afternoon, and at night his Anodyne was repeated. The next day I took off Dreſſings, and conſidering there was no Symptom of hurt within, onely the Wound a little heated by the Tents, I threw them out, and dreſt both the Orifices with Pledgits ſpred with the aboveſaid Digeſtive, embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> &amp;c. applying a Plaiſter and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage as before, and deſiring him to keep his bed five or ſix days longer. I dreſt him afterwards again; and finding the Apertures well diſpoſed to cure, from that time I dreſt him no more, but adviſed him to be temperate in eating and drinking, and if there were occaſion, I would ſee him again. My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant dreſt him afterward, and before the ſeventh day was expired, he was cured, and walkt abroad, not complaining any more of that Wound.</p>
                     <p>Thus it frequently happeneth, that a Sword paſſeth through the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding any conſiderable Part. Yet if the Wound had been kept ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it might have been ſubject to Inflammation, by reaſon of the diſturbance there, from whence ill Accidents might have happened. And what could the Chirurgeon, have advantaged the Cure by keeping ſuch little Wounds open, ſuppoſing bloud had been extravaſated, which is the common pretence? Yet if it be not done, he is uſually condemned by the common vogue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that ſome of our Profeſſion, poſſibly againſt their own judgments, keep them tented often, to the ruine of their Patient.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Wounds of the Head.</head>
                     <p>I Shall now diſcourſe of Wounds of the Head, not onely as they are made by Cut, Stab, or Bruiſe, but alſo of thoſe made by Gun-ſhot; and ſo by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating part of the Diſcourſe next enſuing, give you the full Doctrine of them, by what Inſtrument ſoever made, without a neceſſity of future repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And that you may underſtand the <hi>baſis</hi> whereon theſe Cures are wrought, I ſhall repreſent the Head to you as it is framed.</p>
                     <p>The Head,<note place="margin">Parts of the Head conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> according to <hi>Galen De uſu part.</hi> is the nobleſt Member of our Body, the principall Faculties being there ſeated, for the uſe of which it was ordained; and is ſo contrived, as to be the foundation of Animal Spirits, and alſo to contain the principall Organs both of the internall and externall Senſes.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place the Hairy ſcalp preſents it ſelf to our eyes:<note place="margin">The Hairy ſcalp.</note> and therein is to be conſidered its Thickneſs, Senſe, and Veſſells, with the Muſcles that lie under it. The Hairy ſcalp is thinneſt on the top of the Head; nor is there any Muſcle between it and the Scull in that part, unleſs you will call the <hi>Membrana carnoſa</hi> a Muſcle; which ſome men of late do, and poſſibly not improperly; and the rather, becauſe by it many men move the whole Scalp. If you doubt of a Fracture there, you may boldly cut into the Hairy ſcalp: it is of an obtuſe ſenſe,<note place="margin">Fore-head.</note> and eaſily healed up again. But be cautious how you make your Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Forehead, where a tranſverſe Wound may cauſe the Eye-brows to fall over the Eyes. Therefore if you are forced to make Inciſion, let it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the Fibres. And be carefull that you make no Inciſion upon the Temporall Muſcles,<note place="margin">Temporall Muſcles.</note> for thereby Convulſion and other ill Accidents may happen.</p>
                     <p>Under the Hairy ſcalp lies the <hi>Pericranium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pericranium.</note> which we are to cut through in making way to the <hi>Cranium.</hi> You are to raiſe them both together, when you lay bare the <hi>Cranium</hi> for the uſe of the <hi>Terebra.</hi> For (ſay Authours) if in perforating the <hi>Cranium</hi> you tear this Membrane, Inflammation and Fever may follow; the <hi>Pericranium</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Dura mater</hi> through the Sutures, by which continuity that may alſo partake of the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cranium</hi> follows,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cranium</hi> and Sutures.</note> which is a Bone compoſed of many jointed together by Sutures, of which there are five concern us; <hi>Coronalis, Lambdoïdes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittalis,</hi> and two falſe ones. In perforating the <hi>Cranium,</hi> you are to ſhun theſe, (if you may,) for through them the <hi>Dura mater</hi> paſſes, as I told you, and is continued unto the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> The Sutures divide the Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> by which one part of it may be preſerved intire, while the other is broken, which otherwiſe would be in hazzard. Theſe Sutures are weak in reſiſting Blows, and between them Matter may be unhappily retained, and cauſe a <hi>Caries,</hi> and ſooner work through to the <hi>Dura mater</hi> then in other parts of the Scull. It is neceſſary to know them well, leſt, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives good caution, you take them for Fiſſures. The way of finding them is, by
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95669:196"/>paſſing one String from Ear to Ear, and another from the Noſe to the Crown of the head. The former of theſe will ſhew you the Coronall Suture, the ſecond the Sagittall, which uſually begins at that point where theſe Lines interject, being the part where we make Fontanells, and reacheth to the Crown of the head, and joineth with the <hi>Lambdoides.</hi> Sometimes it beginneth quite at the Noſe. The <hi>Lambdoïdes</hi> ariſeth at the end of the Sagittall, and goeth forked down the two ſides of the <hi>Occiput.</hi> Of the <hi>Suturae nothae,</hi> the two chiefly to be regarded are the <hi>Squamoſae,</hi> which run under the Temporall Muſcle of each ſide, round about the outermoſt verge of the Ear. You are alſo to take notice, that the <hi>Cranium</hi> is thinneſt in the middle part of the Head, and thickeſt in the hinder part, and of a middle thickneſs in the Forehead. Hence it is that Wounds are moſt dangerous in the Crown of the head, where the Scull, by reaſon of its tenuity, eaſily communicates its hurt to the Brain; and alſo for that the upper part of the Brain lies there high, one of the largeſt <hi>Sinus's</hi> being immediately under the Scull, and many capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veins running ſo cloſe with it, as to make themſelves Trenches in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall part of the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Wherefore upon a Blow or Contuſion in this place, the Veins may eaſily be broken, and the bloud extravaſated between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and ill Accidents follow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dura mater,</hi> a ſtrong Membrane, is placed under the <hi>Cranium;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dura mater.</note> the wounding of which is attended frequently by Palſies, and in progreſs of the Diſtemper by Convulſions, with other ill Symptoms; and the greater, if the Wound be in the middle part of the Head according to its length, there being many Veſſells there, which, if they chance to be cut, will fill the vacant ſpace between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Dura mater</hi> with bloud.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pia mater</hi> lies upon the body of the Brain, ſo cloſe,<note place="margin">Pia mater.</note> that a Wound can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made into the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> and the Brain eſcape: and from its many Veins a Flux of bloud muſt follow.</p>
                     <p>The Brain lies under the <hi>Pia mater,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Brain.</note> in whoſe Ventricles is lodged the <hi>Plexus choroïdes,</hi> and under whoſe <hi>baſis</hi> lie large numerous branches of Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Veins, which by great Blows of the Head may be broken.</p>
                     <p>From the Deſcription of the Head we ſhall proceed to the Deſcription of its Wounds, which are ſtrictly ſo called, where any part of the Skin, Fleſh,<note place="margin">Deſcription and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wounds in the Head. Concuſſions, Contuſions, and Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Bones, Membranes or Brain is cut or torn.</p>
                     <p>But where the Skin remaineth whole, Concuſſions and Contuſions do often happen, and will deſerve to be treated of in this place with the Wounds: not onely becauſe they are the frequent Companions of Wounds; but alſo becauſe, when alone, they produce grievous Accidents reſembling thoſe of Fractures, nay often exceeding them. I ſhall therefore gradually deſcribe Concuſſions, Contuſions and Fractures, under the following Heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There may happen Concuſſions of the Brain from a Blow, Fall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay ſometimes from a Box on the ear, wherein the Symptoms may ariſe to a great height, without breaking either the Skin without, or Scull within. Which Concuſſions if they be of the leſſer ſort, wherein no Veſſell is broken or bloud extravaſated, ſo that the perſon is onely ſtunned, he ſoon recovers. But if of the greater ſort, with rupture of the Veſſells and extravaſation of bloud, they produce <hi>Stupores, Vertigines, Deliria,</hi> and many the like Symptoms, and are every whit as dangerous, nay often more dangerous then Fractures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Contuſions, when great, do uſually produce a Fiſſure or Crack of the Scull, either in the ſame part where the Blow was inflicted, and then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fiſſura;</hi> or in the contrary part, in which caſe it obtaineth the name of <hi>Contrafiſſura.</hi> Theſe Fiſſures are through both Tables of the Scull, or one onely.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95669:197"/>If one onely, then either outward, or inward, the other <hi>Lamina</hi> remaining whole. They are long, ſhort; wide, narrow; ſtraight, crooked; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Contuſions are conſiderable whether they be with a Wound, or not. Thoſe without a Wound are for the moſt part accompanied with great Concuſſions, and ſometimes Fiſſure and Fracture, or Depreſſion of one or both Tables: in which caſe the ſpongy medullary intervall that intercedes between the 2 Tables is frequently broken into its minute Fibres, and ſqueezed together. Hereupon Extravaſation of bloud followeth, and other Accidents that will be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the Prognoſticks and in the Obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Next to theſe are Contuſions with Wounds, which are generally attended with Fracture properly ſo called, where a piece is wholly divided from the reſt of the Scull. This Fracture ſometimes conſiſteth of many pieces, ſome whereof are depreſt upon the Membranes, yea into the Brain it ſelf, while others lie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Next to theſe are Wounds made by any ſharp Weapon, which, according to the force, cutteth into the Bone many ways, which Cuts are called <hi>Sedes,</hi> and are reckoned amongſt the Fractures; and ſo thoſe made by Pole-axe, Halberd, and ſuch obtuſe heavy Weapons, may juſtly be termed. But thoſe made by a Sword have ſeemed to me Wounds, and not Fractures; and when they do not penetrate the firſt Table, require no other Cure then that of Wounds; as may be ſeen in ſome of the Obſervations. But when the Penetration is deep, I do treat it as a Fracture, and ſo I place it here.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Out of theſe proceed ſeverall Species of compound Fractures; as the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſma, Camaroſis, Eccope,</hi> &amp;c. which every man's experience will ſuggeſt to him.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Signs.</note> in his 8. Book and 4. Chapter, adviſes, when you are called to a Patient in ſuch caſes as above mentioned, to enquire whether he was ſtunned, or fell down with the Blow, or vomited preſently after. You are alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how he was hurt, whether by Blow, or Fall. For from the force of the Weapon, and manner of the Fall, you may ſhrewdly gueſſe at the caſe. You are alſo to conſider the Tumour, whether it be great, or ſmall. If there be a Wound, nothing is more ſure then your Finger to diſcover the Fracture. If you feel any Aſperity, if it be not a Suture, you may be ſure it is a Fiſſure or Fracture. But ſuppoſing there be neither Wound nor Tumour, yet if the Patient ſuffer under a Palſey in any part, or lie ſtupefied or raving, it is moſt certain the Membranes of the Brain are oppreſt. And if the Hair lie cut in the Wound, you may ſuppoſe the <hi>Cranium</hi> hurt, it being no ſmall force can divide Hair in that place. The hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Thread between the Teeth, or biting a Cruſt, is mentioned by Authours as a way to find out a Fracture: but I think it of no great moment, unleſs the Fracture be near or under the Temporall Muſcle.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of the Head,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are not without danger, how ſlight ſo ever they may appear to common judgment. Inciſed Wounds of the Hairy ſcalp reaching to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> cut by a Rapier, are the leaſt dangerous or difficult of Cure. Thoſe made by a Halberd, Bill, and ſuch like heavy Weapons, are not without danger; ſo alſo thoſe made by Puncture with a Dagger. By how much the nearer they penetrate to the Brain, ſo much the more dangerous they are. All Contuſions of the Head are to be ſuſpected, for from thoſe the greateſt Symptoms do ariſe. If in laying open the <hi>Cranium</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient recover not his Senſes, you may ſuſpect an Extravaſation of bloud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Dura mater;</hi> in which caſe his Life is in great hazzard. Thoſe Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made by Gun-ſhot do for the moſt part beat pieces of the Scull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brain, and ſo may be determined mortall. But be the Hurt what it will, if it penetrate not farther then the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> it is curable, if it
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95669:197"/>be timely laid open, and dreſſed, as ſhall be ſhewed in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <p>In the Cure of Wounds of the Head,<note place="margin">Simple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed wounds.</note> if they be made by a Rapier dividing the Scalp to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> nay though it cut the Scull, if there be no Symptom of an internal Hurt, the Lips of the Wound ought to be brought cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and healed by Agglutination. The Stitching of theſe Wounds is objected againſt by ſome, leſt Matter ſhould be thereby pent in, and foul the Bone. But if you can ſatisfie your ſelf that the Wound ought ſpeedily to be healed, the work is ſafe, if done judiciouſly. A broad in <hi>Spain</hi> I have ſeen them as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtitched as other inciſed Wounds: and in the Wars we ſtitched them ſucceſsfully; and here in Town I have ſtitcht up great Wounds of the Hairy ſcalp. However you ought not to crowd theſe Wounds with Doſſils, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may raiſe a Fever, and prolong the Cure. Therefore having clipt away the Hair, dreſs the Wound <hi>cum pulv. Galen.</hi> and <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> or ſome Defenſative, with Compreſs and Bandage bringing the Lips cloſe together; and afterwards let the Patient bloud, if he did not bleed ſufficiently at the Wound: and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing adminiſter a Clyſter, if the Body require it.

                     <p>In Wounds made by Contuſion where the <hi>Cranium</hi> is a little naked, you ought not preſently to crowd in Doſſils: for if that contuſed Fleſh be well digeſted, the Bone will incarn underneath with the Wound without much
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95669:198"/>difficulty. In thoſe of the worſt Habit of body I have happily incarned, by keeping the Orifice a little open by a ſmall Doſſil preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Parts about from Fluxion by Medicaments and Bandage, as hath been ſhewed in ſuch caſes. Take care that the Matter be not ſhut in by your Dreſſings; for thereby the Wound may be made more hollow, and the Cure prolonged. To prevent which, I have been ſometimes neceſſitated to apply a Compreſs round, leaving a hole in the middle of it, for the diſcharge of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whilſt the Parts about incarned by Compreſſion.</p>
                     <p>But if the Wound be with ſo great Contuſion, that it caſts off a Slough, and leaves the <hi>Cranium</hi> much naked; though it be not fouled either by the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Air, yet it will then be neceſſary to raſp it: for the Bone is naturally ſmooth and ſlippery, as if it were poliſhed, and Fleſh difficultly groweth upon it. Wherefore to haſten the Cure, you ought, by the authority of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and the moſt practical men, to raſp the Bone thin, till you ſee the bloud ready to come out of it: the Bone will thereby be the ſooner ſupplied with materials for generation of Fleſh. But if your Patient will not admit of Raſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, then you ought to keep your Doſſils cloſe to the Lips of the Wound, and make your Exfoliation from the edges, that the ſound part may thruſt off the rotten Bone. For neither Crabs-eyes, nor any Medicine inwardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, or Wine outwardly applied with Lint, or other Medicaments to the middle of a Bone, will ſignifie any thing to the Exfoliation of it: nay, the while you are ſo trifling, the Matter from the edges will rot the Bone under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and in continuance pierce through the firſt Table, and run down between the two Tables, thereby doing much miſchief, and ſo will put you upon the uſe of the <hi>Terebra.</hi> After the Bone is ſcraped, you may dreſs them with Pledgits dipt in <hi>liniment.

If it require Digeſtion otherwiſe, apply them preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> either ſimply, or ſuch wherein hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>pulv. radic. ireos, ariſtoloch. peucedan.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If in a Wound of the Head made by a Sword the Scull be cut flanting off, or into the ſecond Table, if there be no Symptoms of Concuſſion, you ought not to lay open the Wound to ſet on a <hi>Terebra,</hi> but cleanſe and dreſs it up with a proportionable Doſſil preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and digeſt the Lips of the Wound as above ſaid, and attend the Exfoliation; then heal it. Some Authours have adviſed the Raſping of theſe Bones; but in this caſe it is needleſs: for if the Bone be dreſſed as I have ſaid, the Fleſh will ſoon ariſe in that Cut of the Bone, and make Exfoliation of what is neceſſary, and incarn it without your farther trouble.</p>

If the Symptoms do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that there is a Fracture or Fiſſure, you are then without delay to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Hairy ſcalp according as the Part will admit, angularly, or in the manner of a Croſs, or of the Letter T, that the Fracture may be diſcovered by the raiſing of it up with its <hi>Pericranium.</hi>

Whereas if you had laid it open by a croſs Inciſion, you might by onely raiſing the Scalp have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                        <hi>Fallopius</hi> tells us, that where the <hi>Cranium</hi> is contuſed, certain Spots will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear red, not unlike thoſe white ones which are uſual in the Nails of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but after the third day the bloud exhales, and that redneſs ceaſeth. If by the Emplaſter you diſcover the Fiſſure, or that the Bone contuſes, you are to raſp the contuſed Part the whole length: to which purpoſe you ought to be furniſhed with various ſorts of Raſpatories. Whilſt you are working with them, the Lips of the Wound ought to be covered with ſome ſoft Linen, that you neither hurt them, nor yet the Air offend them. Sometimes very ſmall Fiſſures, how inconſiderable ſoever they may ſeem, are the cauſe of the Patient's death, there being often found extravaſated bloud upon the <hi>Dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the Veins broken, either by the Concuſſion from the Blow, or by the rough edges of the inner Table. Therefore you are to conſider the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and accordingly lay open the Wound either by Raſpatories, or otherwiſe cutting into it, ſo as the <hi>Sanies</hi> may be diſcharged, and the aſperity taken away.<note place="margin">Fracture <hi>in Cranio</hi> with depreſſion.</note> But if there be a Fracture of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> you ought to ſatisfie your ſelf whether it be in one or both Tables: if in both, then, whether the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Bone be great, and what Fiſſure there is: and accordingly make way to relieve the <hi>Dura mater</hi> underneath; for it cannot be without great diſturbance, <hi>viz.</hi> Inflammation, Fever, and <hi>Delirium;</hi> from whence <hi>Coma,</hi> Convulſions, Palſies, and Death enſue, if neglected. But if there be a Fiſſure ſo large as to diſcharge the Seroſity, you may take more deliberation in laying it open, or raſping the Bone. If it be otherwiſe, then the Trepan ought to be applied, to give vent to the <hi>Serum,</hi> and to make way for the raiſing the depreſt Bone. But if the Bone be not much depreſt, and the Fiſſure conſiderably large, it is then at your choice whether you will inlarge that Fiſſure, or continue it for evacuation of the Matter, and forbear the uſe of the Trepan, not doubting but a ſmall Depreſſion of the Bone will either riſe, or caſt off, by the benefit of Nature. I know it will be hard to diſſwade ſome Chirurgeons from applying a Trepan in this caſe; for I my ſelf have been glad to comply with ſome of them, in ſetting on a Trepan where the Fiſſure was ſufficiently large, and when all the ill Symptoms were remitted, and where there was no Depreſſure
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:95669:199"/>of the <hi>Cranium.</hi> But what did it ſignify? Indeed, where the Fiſſure lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly for diſcharge of Matter, or where the Depreſſion of the <hi>Cranium</hi> is deep, there a Trepan ought to be timely applied.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Perforation of the <hi>Cranium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Perforation.</note> the Bone muſt be cleared of its <hi>Pericranium,</hi> leſt in ſetting on the <hi>Terebra,</hi> or <hi>Modiolus,</hi> (which are two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall names for a Trepan,) you tear the Membrane. The Lips of the Wound ought alſo to be covered the while. The <hi>Terebra</hi> ought to be ſet on that ſide which is moſt depending. And in caſe of a Depreſſion, make your Perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo near, that you may afterwards be able to raiſe up that by it. When you have ſet on your Trepan, preſs upon it with your left hand, and turn it round with your right. You muſt uſe a little <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> or Milk to cauſe it to move the eaſier, and as it fouls, bruſh it; in doing of which it will cool. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you approach to the ſecond Table, (which you may know by the bloud that appears,) it will be required that you take out the Pin, and proceed more warily, not liſtening to the prattling of the Standers by, but often lifting up your hand, leſt by your compreſſion or haſte you unawares fall upon the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and wound it. Some Chirurgeons do bring out the Bone in the bore; but it will be ſafer to raiſe it up with your Levator, when it is ſo cut, that it is but lightly retained in ſome part. During this work, it is fit the Patient's Ears were ſtopped with Lint, leſt the noiſe diſturb him. The Room ought alſo to be cloſe. The Perforation made <hi>in Cranio,</hi> and the Bone taken out, you are to ſmooth away the Aſperity which remains in the lower Table by the Lenticular inſtrument made for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If after this the Membrane be fouled by the Saw-duſt of the Bone,<note place="margin">Firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after Perforation.</note> you muſt wipe it off with a ſoft Sponge, or a little Lint upon your Probe. The Part being cleanſed, you are to dreſſe up the Membrane. About this firſt Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Authours differ much. <hi>Avicen</hi> dreſt them with Lenients, <hi>viz. ol. roſ. Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> dreſt the Part with <hi>ſiccantia, viz. cum aceto acerrimo.</hi> You may find him poſitively for it in theſe words; <hi>His factis,</hi> (the Perforation being made,) <hi>ea membrana acri aceto reſpergenda eſt, ut ſi intus concretus cruor remanet, diſcutia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> &amp;c. He ſprinkled the Membrane with ſharp vinegar, to prevent the Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and diſſolve the concreted Bloud lying upon the ſaid Membrane or <hi>Dura mater.</hi> But the moſt part of the Ancients, and many of the Moderns, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Lenients, as <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> that the bloud extravaſated, and lying upon the <hi>Dura mater, in pus convertatur,</hi> may be digeſted. But in this you are to be guided by your Eye. If there be <hi>Sanies</hi> or Putrefaction, <hi>mel roſ. ſpir. vini,</hi> and higher Detergents may be uſed, accordingly as the Putrefaction is more or leſs. If there be much bloud extravaſated, or that you fear bleeding, that of <hi>Celſus</hi> may be proper: but if the bloud be recent, and exceed not in quantity, it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happened from ſome Scratch of your Trepan, or ſome little Aſperity of the inner Table. If there be neither of theſe, but the Membrane freſh, and of its naturall colour, then you are not to grieve that Membrane now expoſed to the Air with Detergents, nor by the acrimony of Vinegar: for if you ſhall by ſcratching of the Membrane make it bloudy, and then dreſs it with either <hi>acetum</hi> or <hi>mel roſ. ſpir. vini,</hi> &amp;c. you ſhall then proceed contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Indications in Chirurgery, which teacheth to digeſt recent Wounds before you deterge: and indeed what would you deterge?</p>
                     <p>Therefore I do adviſe the uſe of Lenients, not onely by the authority of thoſe ancient and modern Chirurgeons, but by my own practice. <hi>Galen</hi> propoſed <hi>ſang. columb.</hi> and the bloud of Turtles dropt warm from their wings. <hi>Falop.</hi> and <hi>Fabric. ab Aquapend.</hi> propoſed <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> with <hi>reſin. abietis:</hi> and afterwards they increaſed the Reſin, and leſſened the Oil. But if there be Putrefaction through the long lying of concreted bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>mel roſ.</hi> and <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> are
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95669:200"/>proper, yea <hi>mel Aegyptiac.</hi> and higher if occaſion ſhall offer. But in the common caſes, after recent Terebrations, Reſin by its emplaſtick quality mixed with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> perfects the concoction ſooner, and by its anodyne quality ſecures the Part from Inflammation. It ought to be proportioned to the Habit of body: dry Bodies require more of the Reſin, and leſs Oil. And by this ſimple Medicament I never failed of good Digeſtion; and afterwards by the tempering of it as I have ſaid I have deterged and digeſted, always continuing the uſe of it untill the Membrane was well digeſted, never finding the leaſt prejudice the bare Bone received from it.<note place="margin">Caution.</note> But you muſt take care that you do not uſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtives unſeaſonably, for thereby you may relax Parts. Therefore after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion adde more Reſin, and leſs Oil. Or you may mix <hi>mel roſ.</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin in ſtead of the Oil, which will anſwer your intention, both to deterge and incarn. Or you may uſe this to both purpoſes; its Compoſition will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it ſelf: ℞ <hi>terebinth.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the uſe of Medicaments you are to conſider the Part and Habit of body, and adde or diminiſh your Simples accordingly as you deſign to deterge or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo they will perform all intentions. Some Authours have limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us a time to dreſs with this or that Medicament; <hi>viz.</hi> to uſe Digeſtives to the fourth day, from that time to deterge to the ſeventh, and to incarn to the fourteenth day. But herein you muſt make uſe of your own judgment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to cheriſh the native heat. If the Wound penetrates to the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> you muſt conſider the force of the Weapon, and make haſte to relieve the Parts under the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> Yet a day or two before the Battell of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man attending the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> in his Retreat thither received a large Wound between the Sagittall and Coronall Sutures by a Sword, it cutting through the <hi>Cranium</hi> to the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> The Membrane was covered with the ſmall Shivers of Bones. He had onely a thin linen Cap over it, his haſte not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to be dreſſed. And it may be it was the better for him: for if Doſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills had been haſtily crowded upon the Bones, ſevere Symptoms would have followed; whereas the Shivers lying lightly upon the Membrane, he was free, and being ignorant of his danger, rid a great Journey. I after took them out, and dreſt the Membrane with Digeſtives the ſhort time we were together.<note place="margin">Gun-ſhot.</note> But when Fractures are made with Bullets or Slugs, there the Hairy ſcalp and pieces of the <hi>Cranium</hi> are driven in together upon the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> In which caſes you muſt preſently lay open the Hairy ſcalp, and raiſe it up with the Bones, and relieve the oppreſt Membrane. If the Flux of bloud be great, cleanſe it with a Sponge dipt in Red wine or Vinegar, and dreſs it as hath been ſhewed. If the Opening in the fractured <hi>Cranium</hi> be not ſufficient, make one in the moſt declining part, and raiſe up the Bones, and free the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of whatever may offend it. But do not take out more Bones then needs muſt: like ſome of thoſe Chirurgeons I have met carrying them about in their Pockets, boaſTing in that which was their ſhame. For if you look well upon ſuch, you may ſee many of them were corrupted by the Matter through the ignorance of the Chirurgeon. For recent Fractures of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> do frequently unite like thoſe in other Parts, if the Matter hath liberty to diſcharge from within. Therefore having raiſed up the Bones that are looſe, dreſs the others dry with Catagmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and take care that they
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95669:200"/>be not overgrown with looſe Fleſh, and they will happily agglutinate.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happeneth in great Concuſſions, that we lay open the Hairy ſcalp; and though we diſcover neither Fiſſure nor Fracture, yet we perforate the <hi>Cranium,</hi> to relieve the Patient: but if notwithſtanding the Symptoms of <hi>Coma</hi> or <hi>Paralyſis</hi> do not remit, you may ſhrewdly ſuſpect the Extravaſation of bloud lieth deeper. For it ſometimes happeneth in Concuſſions, that the extravaſated bloud lieth between the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia mater,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while amongſt the Ventricles of the Brain. In which caſes, if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration of the <hi>Cranium</hi> relieve them not, you muſt make Apertion through the <hi>Dura mater;</hi> and if the bloud lie between it and the <hi>Pia mater,</hi> it may haply be diſcharged. How that is to be dreſt, I ſhall ſhew you preſently: but for the moſt part, the long retention of Matter ſpacelates the Brain; and as the Patient ſuffered from the beginning under the ſevere Symptoms of <hi>Coma</hi> or <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> ſo he dies at laſt Convulſive.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Wounds of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> the Lenients of <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> or warm Pigeons bloud are proper: they are anodyne, and digeſt. <hi>Ol. hyperic.</hi> and Maſtich are alſo good mixt with Reſin. <hi>Fabr. ab Aquapendent.</hi> cites <hi>Galen,</hi> and he <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> as dreſſing theſe Wounds with <hi>ſucc. calaminth.</hi> and afterwards ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling <hi>pulv. milii</hi> on the Membrane to incarn it; the <hi>milium</hi> moderating the heat of the other. He delivers them to us as <hi>ſiccantia, detergentia,</hi> and <hi>incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantia,</hi> The Unition and Incarning of the Lips of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Fleſhy ſubſtance that ariſeth upon the Membrane, which afterwards, as it increaſeth, doth unite them, and overſpreading that part groweth up to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and unites with that <hi>Callus,</hi> (after Exfoliation of the Bone,) and becomes one body with it, filling up the place that was perforated, and in time groweth more firm then the Bone it ſelf. But the while you muſt be carefull that your Lenients make not the Fleſh too lax by their greazineſs; for ſo a <hi>Fungus</hi> will thruſt out thence, which may be vexatious to you. This in the beginning may be prevented by Deſiccants, and waſted by <hi>Mercur. praecip. pulv. cort. granat. balauſt. roſ. rub.</hi> or <hi>alumen uſt.</hi> alone. But if it grow very big, it muſt be taken off by Ligature. Yet to tell you truly, I never met with any ſuch like diſturbance as is repreſented to us by Authours; nor ſhall you, if you uſe your Deſiccants timely. For the Vitriol-ſtone takes this off with little pain, and diſpoſes the Part to cicatrize, if it be uſed with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and timely.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pia mater</hi> is (as I have elſewhere ſaid) a moſt delicate fine Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, and adheres ſo cloſe to the Brain, that it can ſcarce be hurt without a Wound in the Brain it ſelf: which Wound is for the moſt part mortall, partly for that the Membrane is full of Veins, and ſubject to great effuſion of bloud; partly alſo becauſe the Brain being expoſed to the Air, is thereby over-cooled, and corrpting groweth fluid, and is thruſt forth by the contraction of the <hi>Meninges,</hi> (or Membranes,) which are irritated by the conſtant pain they ſuffer from the putrefaction of the Brain; and ſo it happeneth that it worketh out at the Wound. So long as any remaineth in that Ventricle, you muſt make way to theſe Wounds by removing the ſhattered Fleſh and Bones: but if they will not come eaſily away, leave it to Nature, leſt the Patient die under your hands, and you be thought to haſten his death. Your Dreſſings muſt be with <hi>Galen</hi>'s Powder and Hares-fur <hi>cum albumine ovi</hi> upon Pledgits, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Bleeding, and retain the Brain within its bounds. Apply over them your Dreſſings, as in the Wounds of the <hi>Dura mater:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note> remembring in all theſe Gun-ſhot Wounds to cut off the ſhattered Lips of the Hairy ſcalp, leſt a Gleet drop from them upon the <hi>Meninges</hi> and Brain, and heighten the Accidents. If the Brain be retained within its Membranes, the <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura mater,</hi>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:95669:201"/>and they digeſt and incarn, then you may proceed in the reſt of the Cure as in Fractures of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> as hath already been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>In all Hurts of the Head, what ſort ſoever they be of, the Body is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied; and the rather, if there be <hi>Plethora</hi> or <hi>Cacochymia:</hi> for in ſuch Habits of body Humours are more apt to ſtir up ill Symptoms. Therefore you ought timely to let them bloud in the Neck or Arm on the ſame ſide; and repeat Bleeding according to the exigency, and the ſtrength of the Patient's body. Alſo Cupping (with or without Scarification) of the Neck and Shoulders, with Fontanells under the Ears, is neceſſary. Then lenient Purgatives, ſuch as may evacuate the ſerous bloud, which by reaſon of its tenuity and heat readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flies to the affected Part. Theſe Purgatives muſt be ſuch as have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Fourth Intention of Wounds in generall, to which I refer you. Cordial Species and Electuaries may be proper, if they be proportioned to the Temperature of the body, hotter or colder, as there are Fever or other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents joyned with the Malady; in which caſes Juleps and Emulſions are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Vulnerary drinks are ſometimes in uſe here, if they be fitted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the Part. The Ingredients for theſe are <hi>beton. artemiſ. caryophyll. primula veris, lilium convallium, ſalvia, hyperic. ſanicula, veronica, plantag. flor. roſ. rub. nuc. moſchat.</hi> &amp;c. as in the Chapter forementioned.

                     <p>The externall Applications have been already ſet down all along as I trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ſeverall Accidents befalling the Head,<note place="margin">Externalls.</note> whether made by Contuſion, or Wound affecting the Hairy ſcalp, <hi>Cranium,</hi> or <hi>Meninges</hi> of the Brain.

                     <p>I Was ſent for to a young fellow who had been ſhrewdly cudgell'd about the Pate.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of Contuſion without wound or concuſſion.</note> He was ſick in bed, and dozed with the pain. I looked upon his Head, and ſaw it ſwell'd in ſeverall places: ſome of the Swellings were big and pappy, abounding with extravaſated <hi>Serum.</hi> I preſently looked for the Jugular Veins, and ſeeing them full, I opened the faireſt, and took away at leaſt a dozen ounces of bloud: then cauſed the Hair of his Head to be ſhaved off, and embrocated all his Head, Neck and Jaws with a Mixture of <hi>ol. roſ. myrtill. acet. cum album. ovor.</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm over all his Head of <hi>far. hord. fabar. flor. roſ. rub. balauſt. bacc. myrtill.</hi> decocted in Oxymel. A Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was that evening adminiſtred, and an Anodyne draught diſpoſed him to reſt that night. The next morning I was informed he had ſlept at times, but I found him hot, and his Pulſe quick. I opened the other Jugular Vein, and ſeeing him bleed with a full ſtream, I permitted it to flow proportionably: then having a Fomentation ready of Claret-wine wherein had been infuſed <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> &amp;c. I took off Dreſſings, and ſtuped them, and thought to have opened one of theſe Tumours; but ſeeing it dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, I forbare, and embrocated his Head again <hi>cum ol. roſ. myrtill. &amp; aceto,</hi> and applied the Cataplaſm as before. By theſe Applications I dried up the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in a great meaſure before the ſeventh day; then added ſome Cephalicks to the former Ingredients, and boiled them in Wine and Water, with which I cauſed his Head to be fomented, and afterwards applied <hi>Vigo</hi>'s <hi>Cerat. ad contuſ.</hi> During the firſt ſeven days I permitted him onely Water-grewell or Panado, and kept his Body ſoluble by Clyſters; but afterwards gave him more liberty, and purged him: by which method he recovered, without any manner of laying open. And thus all external Contuſions may be happily cured.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Quality,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of Contuſion with an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymoſis</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> aged between thirty and forty years, by accident of a Fall out of her Coach bruiſed her Head a little above the right Temporal Muſcle. She was ſtunned with the Fall, but did not vomit. She was dreſſed by ſome of her Servants with ſuch Medicaments as thoſe of her own Sex ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. About fourteen days after, being indiſpoſed, ſhe came to Town, and ſent for me. I ſaw a large <hi>Ecchymoſis</hi> remaining, and a Tumour of the bigneſſe of a Pheaſant's egge: it was ſoft, and ſeemed to be full of a corrupt <hi>Serum.</hi> There appeared no hopes of diſcuſſing it, and yet it was not ſafe to permit it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:95669:202"/>to lie longer ſo near the Bone. Wherefore I applied a mild Cauſtick upon it, and dividing the Eſcar gave vent to the <hi>Serum</hi> and ſome Clots of grumous bloud; then fomented it with Wine, and dreſſed it up with a Doſſil ſpred with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> and <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> over it upon the Eſcar, and embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. cham.</hi> applied <hi>empl. diapalm.</hi> with Compreſſe and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. At the next opening I ſaw the Ulcer well digeſted, and no part of the Bone bare; nor was it painfull in the time of dreſſing or afterward: yet from the firſt day I dreſſed her, ſhe uſually fainted the while, and put us upon a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of laying her down in her Bed ſome time before we had finiſht our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; where after ſhe had lain an hour or two very ſick, ſhe recovered again, and walked about her Chamber very well. Her Friends and Relations, who viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her often and ſaw her thus diſtempered, ſuſpected it to ariſe from the Wound, but I ſuppoſed it Vapours, and prevailed with her to conſult a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The Phyſician being come, I took off Dreſſings, and ſhewed him the Ulcer well digeſted, and diſpoſed to heal, without the leaſt ſign of ill: the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian alſo concluded ſo. But before I had dreſſed her up, ſhe fainted, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to her Bed ſick. Theſe Faintings increaſing, her Phyſician began to ſuſpect it proceeded from the Contuſion; but her recovering again ſo well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, confirmed him that they were Vapours, and that by Purging ſhe would be relieved. She complied, and was moderately purged once in 3 or 4 days, whereby ſhe was ſomewhat freed of theſe Fits, and I had liberty to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrize the Ulcer. After which I made her a Fontanell in her Leg, and ſhe retired to her Houſe in the Country, where ſhe took Phyſick, and recovered perfectly well. If theſe fainting Fits had proceeded from the preceding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, they would not ſo have intermitted and gone off as they did.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of about 36 years of age was wounded upon the Road by a Blow with a Spintree-bar upon the <hi>Os frontis,</hi> near the Coronall Suture,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wound.</note> about the length of two inches. I cleanſed the Wound with a Sponge, and clipt the Hair away: then putting my Finger into the Wound, I felt the <hi>Pericranium</hi> ſound and ſmooth; and ſeeing no Symptoms in the Patient of Fracture or Concuſſion, I brought the Lips of the Wound cloſe together, dreſſed them with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> upon Pledgits with an <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe over it, putting him on a linen Cap, and his Peruke over that. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to let him bloud that night, in conſideration that he had bled much upon the Road. The next morning, finding him in good temper, I did neither let him bloud nor dreſs him; but the day after I took off Dreſſings in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and Dr. <hi>Walter Needham.</hi> The Wound ſeeming near cloſed, I applied a Stupe or two wrung out of Red wine, and dreſſed him with <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rcei.</hi> The ſecond day after I viewed it again, and ſeeing the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fleſh between the Lips of the Wound cicatrizing, I dreſſed them with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. tutiae,</hi> and continued to doe ſo every other day. During his Cure, he kept his Chamber, and was healed in very few days; whereas if his Wound had been fill'd with Doſſills, a Fever would have followed, and other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which would have confined him longer to his Chamber.</p>
                     <p>A Coachman being wounded with a Rapier to the Bone between the Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and Coronall Sutures about an inch in length, the next Barber dreſſed him,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat, of a wound betwixt the Sagittall and Coronall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and called in a young Chirurgeon to help him. They (as they ſaid) felt a Shiver of the Bone cut off, and ſticking in the <hi>Pericranium;</hi> whereupon they divided the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and laid the Bone bare, filling the Wound up with Doſſills. The fellow being of a full Body, and the bloud fermenting, a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver followed, and the ſeventh day the Lips of the Wound and the Parts about were inflamed and ſwelled. They then dreſſed the Bone with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini &amp; mel roſ.</hi> and deterged before they had digeſted; by which the Bone
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:95669:203"/>was ſtained, and a neceſſity followed of exfoliating it: whereas ſuch an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wound might have been incarned by <hi>liniment. Arcei.</hi> But this practice will not want thoſe that will defend it: and who can help it?</p>
                     <p>A poor Woman near <hi>Ludgate</hi> coming out of her Chamber one night,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of a large wound of the <hi>Calvaria.</hi>
                        </note> and pulling the Door to her by the Key, it ſlipt out, and ſhe tumbling down Stairs, cut and raiſed up the Hairy ſcalp from the beginning of the <hi>Lambdoïdes</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. I cauſed the Hair to be clipt and ſhaved away from about the Wound, and cleanſed it from the bloud, then brought the Lips cloſe together by three or four Stitches, embrocated the Parts about <hi>cum album. ovi, aceto, &amp; ol. roſ.</hi> and dreſſed her up with Agglutinatives, applying over all <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> and Bandage; then gave her an Anodyne draught, and left her to reſt. The next morning I took off my Bandage and <hi>emplaſt.</hi> and embrocated the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> applying a Cataplaſm <hi>ex farin. hord. &amp; fabar.</hi> decocted in Oxycrate, and adding <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> I took away a little bloud by opening a Vein in her Arm, and preſcribed her a Clyſter of Milk and Sugar that afternoon. I continued the Cataplaſm morning and night, but dreſt not the Sutures till the third day; and by that time the Tumour being diminiſhed, and the Wound inclined to Agglutination, I dreſt up the Wound again as before. At the next opening I cut out the Stitches, and dreſt the Wound with Sarcoticks and <hi>empl. beton.</hi> over all, in ſtead of the Cataplaſm; and in a few days cured her of that Wound by Agglutination.</p>
                     <p>A Young fellow,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of the <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> torn off.</note> Servant to a Horſe-courſer, was thrown off his Horſe againſt ſome of the Bars in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> whereby the <hi>Calvaria</hi> or Hairy ſcalp was torn up from the Coronall Suture to the Temporall Muſcle, on the left ſide; the Scull was bared between two and three inches in breadth. He was led to the next Barber, who cut the piece off, and hanged it up in his Shop. The day after the Patient was brought to me. I cauſed the Hair to be ſhaved off from about the Wound, and dreſt the Bone and Lips with <hi>liniment. Arcei</hi> warm, embrocated the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; chamaemel.</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over the Wound, with Compreſſe and Bandage rowling up his Head. He had been let bloud the day before, without conſideration of the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which he had loſt from his Wound. I continued the former way of dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Wound and Bone, untill they were well digeſted: during which the edges of the Bone incarning round, I raſped the middle of the Bone, and thereby diſpoſed a <hi>Callus</hi> to put forth. After Digeſtion, I deterged with <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dif. Paracelſi;</hi> and as the <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt off the Bone, I dreſt it with Pledgits dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> preſt out dry, and afterwards by Epuloticks, as <hi>unguent. tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> &amp;c. cicatrized the Lips of the Wound even with the <hi>Callus</hi> which roſe from the Bone; and about that time, to diſpoſe it the better to cicatrize, he was purged. Thus it was cured as Wounds with loſs of Subſtance; a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and vexatious work to the Patient and Chirurgeon; which might at firſt have been cured by Agglutination, with a leſs <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> and thereby he might have enjoyed the naturall tegument of his Hair, whereas now that part remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bald and unſeemly.</p>
                     <p>A Servant of the <hi>King</hi>'s,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of a contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wound.</note> of about 28 years of age, being diſtracted, and ſuſpicious that every man he ſaw would doe him a miſchief, walking abroad one day, thought himſelf purſued, and ran into the next houſe up 2 pair of Stairs into a Chamber, when hearing ſome body following him he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Window juſt as a Coach was paſſing by, and pitcht with his Head upon one of the Wheels. He was taken up ſtunned and ſhrewdly wounded, carried into the next houſe, and dreſt by a Chirurgeon, who alſo let him bloud. The next day I was ſent by his <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s command to take care of him, and ſaw the Dreſſings taken off. His Wound was between the Sagittall and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronall
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95669:203"/>Sutures to the Bone, with great attrition of the Hairy ſcalp. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the manner of his Fall, with the Frenzy and Stupour he lay under, opened his Wound by a croſs Inciſion, and cutting off the corner'd Lips, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it up with dry Doſſills of Lint, with Aſtringents and Bandage. I direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Clyſter to be adminiſtred that afternoon, and let him bloud that night, repeating it again the day after. Dr. <hi>Walter Needham</hi> preſcribed him an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the cold Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to drink often in a day. By all which he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably relieved, and recovered his Senſes ſoon after. I opened his Wound the third day, and ſaw the <hi>Cranium</hi> ſmooth and naturall, the Lips alſo tending to Digeſtion. I fomented it with a Stupe wrung out of Claret-wine, and dreſt it up with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi,</hi> and embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum oleo roſ.</hi> applied <hi>emplaſtr. diachalcith.</hi> with Compreſſe and Bandage. After I had thus digeſted the Wound, I raſped the <hi>Cranium</hi> to the quick, dreſſing it up with <hi>unguent. Arcei,</hi> and the Lips of the Wound with <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> and by the help of the Vitriol-ſtone I deterged them: and as the <hi>Callus</hi> grew up out of the <hi>Cranium</hi> to unite with the Lips, I dreſſed it with Pledgits preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> cicatrized it, and reſtored him cured.</p>
                     <p>A Cook-maid, by the fall of a Jack-weight upon her Head,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of a great contuſed wound.</note> was beaten down, and ſtunned for ſome while by the Blow: ſhe vomited, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into her Chamber. There were three Wounds in the Hairy ſcalp to the <hi>Cranium,</hi> with a great Tumour. The Bone ſeemed to me to be depreſt and fiſſured. I preſently made a circular Inciſion, and raiſed up that part of the Hairy ſcalp in order to Terebration, and filled up the Wound with Doſſills of Lint preſt out of Red wine; then embrocated her Head with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and put on an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with Compreſſe: then ſhaving the Hair from the Parts about, I applied Pledgits ſpred with my Digeſtive upon the Lips of the Wound, Compreſſes dipt in Oxycrate, and rowled up her Head. Some hours after I cauſed her to be let bloud about eight ounces, and that night gave her <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vj. <hi>ſyr. de meconio</hi> in a draught of <hi>aq. papaver.</hi> with a little <hi>aq. cardiac.</hi> The next day I took off Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and viewing well the bare Bone, I found neither Depreſſion nor Fiſſure. I was deceived by the ſhape of her Head, ſhe being double-crowned, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour great, and the Sagittall Suture running underneath. I fomented the Parts affected with <hi>vin. rubr.</hi> wherein were decocted <hi>flor. roſ. rub. cham. flor. beton. ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. abſinth. bacc. myrtill.</hi> &amp;c. then dreſt the Bone and Lips, the former with <hi>liniment.

This method I continued till the Wound was digeſted, and the Tumour waſted. Then I deterged the Lips of the Wound with <hi>mundif. Paracelſ.</hi> and the Vitriol-ſtone, dreſſing the Bone with Sarcoticks, and applied over all one of <hi>Vigo</hi>'s Cerots in ſtead of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm. By this method the Bone incarned; after which ſhe retired with Medicaments to be dreſt by ſome of her Fellow-ſervants at her Maſter's houſe a few miles off. She ſometimes came to Town, and was aſſiſted by me in the cicatrizing of the Wound, ſo as hath been ſhewed in the former Laceration of the <hi>Calvaria.</hi> I did not believe ſo great a Blow could have been without a Fracture and great Accidents; otherwiſe I ſhould not ſo preſently have raiſed off the Hairy ſcalp.</p>
                     <p>A Tradeſman returning from viſiting ſome of his Friends in the Country,<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Forehead and Face.</note> near <hi>Knights-bridge</hi> fell off his Horſe to the ground, bruiſing and wounding his Forehead and Face. He was taken up as dead; but ſome while after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering life again, they put him into a Coach, and brought him to his houſe.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95669:204"/>I found him in his Bed labouring under a great Concuſſion. He was not capable of giving any account of his Ailment. His Face and Noſe were much bruiſed; there was alſo a Wound upon the <hi>Os cribriformis.</hi> I cauſed the Bloud and Gravell to be waſht out of his Wound, and with my Knife laid it open a little higher up towards the Forehead. Then viewing the Bone, and ſeeing it without Fiſſure, I brought the Lips cloſe together, and dreſt the Wound with Agglutinatives, and <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over it and his Face; and having cauſed the Hair to be ſhaved off the fore-part of his Head, from the Coronall Suture down to his Ears, and embrocated the diſeaſed Parts with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> I applied a Cataplaſm of <hi>farin. hord. pulv. flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. bacc. myrtill.</hi> decocted in Oxymel, then let him bloud 10 or 12 ounces. A neighbouring Phyſician viſited him that night, and preſcribed him what he thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The Patient lay dozing all that night, groaning frequently, and was no better in the morning: he ſpake not willingly to any of us, nor ſo as we could underſtand what he ſaid. That day I took off Dreſſings, viewed and felt the Parts about. The left Eye was inflamed, the Lid ſwelled, and the Forehead bruiſed. I was not able to make out any thing whereby I might take new indications; and therefore dreſt him up again as before, ordering a little Breaſt-milk to be dropt warm into his Eye, and renewing the Embrocation and Cataplaſm. That day he was let bloud again, and a Clyſter adminiſtred, with what elſe his Phyſician thought neceſſary. The next day he being nothing better, the deceaſed Mr. <hi>Boun</hi> a Chirurgeon was conſulted. We took off Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and viewed the Wound. The Bone was fair, without the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> concluded that the Wound ſhould be cured without farther enquiry into it; which accordingly was done in few days after without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foliation. Bliſtering of his Neck and Shoulders, and Cupping with Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made; alſo Fontanells behind his Ears; Fomentations and Plaiſters were likewiſe applied to his Head: but the relief was ſmall. Yet by theſe and frequent Purging, after a month or 6 weeks, he was ſo well as to get abroad, but was indiſpoſed in his Head. His Eye was cured; but after he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his affairs abroad ſome weeks, on a ſudden that Eye-lid fell down, and ſome months after he loſt the ſight of the Eye without any outward ſoarneſs, it being the effect of the Concuſſion. He was alive at the time of the Fire, and may be ſo ſtill for ought I know. If ought was omitted for his Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was farther Bleeding.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 30 years of age,<note place="margin">10 Obſervat. of another Concuſſion, with a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Leg.</note> coming out of <hi>Hartford-ſhire</hi> through <hi>Tottenham,</hi> and riding upon the Cauſey near an Inne, one emptying a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot out of the window as he was paſſing by, his Horſe ſtarted, and ruſhed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently between the Sign-poſt and a Tree which ſupported part of the Sign. The poor Gentleman was beaten off his Horſe, and lay ſtunned on the ground. The people fetcht immediately a Barber-Chirurgeon from <hi>London.</hi> Sr. <hi>T.B.</hi> upon notice of his Friend's miſhap, ſent me thither; where I found the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lying upon the ground, the people and Chirurgeon gazing upon him. I felt his Pulſe much oppreſt, the right Brow bruiſed, and inquired whether they had let him bloud. The Chirurgeon replied, he had opened a Vein in his Arm, but it would not bleed. I replied, We muſt make him bleed, though it be by ſlitting his Veins. Turning his Head on one ſide, I ſaw the jugular Vein on the bruiſed ſide turgid, and opened it. He bled freely. After I had taken about twelve ounces, the bloud ran down from his Arm, which had been opened before and would not bleed. We bled him till he came to life, and then he raved and ſtruggled with us. Having ſtopt the Bleeding, we cauſed the people to carry him into the Inne, and put him into a Bed. All the while they carried him, and were making him unready, he roared and was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95669:204"/>eſpecially whilſt they were pulling off his Stocking from his right Leg; which inquiring more particularly into, we found broken ſhort in the middle of the Thigh-bone, cloſe by a bony Wen, (of the bigneſs of a Tennis-ball.)<note place="margin">A great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wen.</note> Upon ſight whereof we prepared Dreſſings, and endeavoured to ſet the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. He oppoſed us mainly in the ſetting of it, and dreſſing it up. But ſome of the people holding him down in his Bed, we ſet and dreſt his Leg as is ſhewed in the Lecture of Simple Fractures. But his Hands being at liberty, he looſened the Bandage which we had put on the fractured Bones in ſpight of our reſiſtence. We contented our ſelves in what we had endeavoured, and from that time left his Leg to lie unſet, he not permitting ſo much as a Plaiſter over it. We then prepared Applications for his Head, ſhaved the Hair from that ſide of the Temporall Muſcle, embrocated the part which ſeemed to us affected <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm of Bean-meal (which was ſpeedieſt to be had) boiled up with Oxymel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he permitting it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That bound on, I left my Aſſiſtent to ſtay with him, and returned my ſelf to <hi>London.</hi> The next day Sr. <hi>T. B.</hi> ſent for Sr. <hi>Charls Scarburgh,</hi> and carried us with him to <hi>Tottenham,</hi> where we found the Patient raving, and by their report he had done ſo all night. We underſtood not one word he ſpake. His Pulſe was low and intermitting. Upon which conſideration Venaeſection was deferred. What was neceſſary for him to take, the Phyſician then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. His Bruiſe was upon the Temporall Muſcle, a Part not to be laid open upon a bare Surmiſe; wherefore we renewed our Embrocations and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms, and left my Aſſiſtent to wait upon the Patient, Sr. <hi>Charls Scarburgh</hi> making a Journey farther into the Country. The next day I returned, and finding the Patient raving as I had left him, I ſuppoſing his Diſtemper procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from an Inflammation of the Membranes of the Brain, and that by Venae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection onely he was to be relieved, I let him bloud on the ſame Jugular as before about 10 ounces, and ſo proceeded every day, or ſecond day at leaſt, the Patient bearing it well, and ſeeming to be relieved. His Pulſe roſe upon it, and he ſlumbered ſometimes, and took his Nouriſhment, which before he did not. About the ſeventeenth day I coming to <hi>Tottenham</hi> met my Aſſiſtent going to <hi>London,</hi> who told me that the Patient was grown more ſenſible of his fractured Thigh. I perſwaded him back, rejoycing to hear that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſo well: but coming near his Chamber, I heard him hallowing. It troubled me what to doe. I knew his Bleeding had much relieved him; but the people, as alſo my Aſſiſtent, diſliked my ſo often letting him bloud, and was wont abuſively to ſay, Now you ſhall ſee our Maſter let him bloud again: they concluding that I would be the death of the Patient. However I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to bleed him once more, and no more. This I declared, with the neceſſity of doing it, and accordingly opened the ſame Vein again, and held a white Stone-porrenger to receive the bloud, which flowed with a ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtream, the Patient lying quietly the while upon his Back. I put the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renger into my Aſſiſtent's hand, and ſeeing the bloud flow with much Vigour, I catcht up haſtily a Pewter-porrenger, purpoſing to take a little in that. (In bleeding theſe Veins in the Neck, we uſually holding the Porrenger cloſe to their Neck, it ſerves us as a Bandage to intercept the deſcent of the bloud.) I put this Porrenger into my Aſſiſtent's hands, with pretence to make Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to lay upon the Vein; but ſtood at a little diſtance, looking my Patient in his Face, with a reſolution to bleed him untill I ſaw his Countenance change: which I did, and then ſtept to the Patient to ſtop the Vein. The while the Porrenger was taking away, the bloud ran out of it on one ſide, it having been melted, and the hole ſo covered by Soder that I did not ſee it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. During the while he was bleeding I thought him long, and wondered
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95669:205"/>to ſee ſo little bloud in that Porrenger from ſo full a ſtream: but ſeeing the Bed ſo bloudy, it was evident that when the melted hole preſt not againſt his Neck, the bloud ran into the Bed, which deceived me. But the Patient up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking a little of his cordial Julep refreſht his Spirits. I ſate a while by him, and left him pretty hearty. The next day I returned ſooner then I uſed to do, being doubtfull how I ſhould find him: but, to my wonder, he was perfectly well in his Senſes, and diſcourſed ſoberly of what paſſages he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the time of his <hi>Delirium.</hi> We preſently prepared to ſet his frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Thigh-bone, it having lain ſeventeen days unſet, yet was without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Tumour, or Pain. The <hi>Callus</hi> I ſuppoſe was thruſt out at the ends of the Bones, and that had covered the aſperity of them, and the large Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Diſeaſe had made Revulſion and Evacuation. We brought the ends of the Bone together by an eaſy Extenſion, and dreſt it up as is uſuall in ſimple Fractures. In leſs then twenty days the <hi>Callus</hi> dried, and his Leg was ſo ſtrong as to bear him again: and ſome weeks after he went abroad about his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>A Youth about ten years of age was ſtruck down by a blow of a Cudgell on his Head.<note place="margin">11. Obſervat. of a Fracture with a long Fiſſure and depreſſion of the <hi>Cranium.</hi>
                        </note> I found him lying upon a Bed deprived of his Speech and the uſe of his Legs. Taking the Plaiſter off his Forehead, there was no Wound nor conſiderable Swelling; but ſearching with my Fingers I felt a Depreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bone: upon which having advertiſed the Parents of the danger of the Child, and the way of my proceeding, I ſent for the Chirurgeon dwelling at the next door, who had applied the firſt Plaiſter, deſiring to retain him for the more conſtant attendance. We made Dreſſings ready in order to Dilatation; then cauſing the Hair to be ſhaved off, I made an Inciſion ſo large as to ſet on the <hi>Terebra,</hi> if occaſion ſhould be, for the raiſing up the depreſt Bone. In dividing the Hairy ſcalp towards the Coronall Suture, I eſpied a Fiſſure run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up from the fractured Bone beyond my firſt Inciſion; wherefore I laid the Fiſſure more open, out of which I ſaw a quantity of ſerous bloud flow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forth. The Depreſſion was a piece of Bone as broad as a Three-pence ſunk under the Scull. I filled up the Opening with Doſſills of dry Lint, and applied over all a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth. &amp; vitell. ovi</hi> upon Pledgits, and <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> with Bandage to keep them on. The next day in the preſence of Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> and ſome Country Phyſician with Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> Chirurgeon, I took off the Dreſſings, and ſet the Trepan above the fractured Bone, ſo to avoid the great Scar that muſt have been if I had ſet it below the Fracture, and conſidering withall the Porineſs of the Bone below. The <hi>Terebra</hi> ſet on, the Bone taken out, and the inner edges ſmoothed by the Lenticular inſtrument, I put in a Levator, and raiſed up the depreſt Bone even with the reſt: that done, I placed in a Sindon dipt in <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> with a third part of Reſin; then with a round Doſſil filled up the Bore: after which I opened the Fiſſure with my Rugines, ſcraping away its edges, that no <hi>Sanies</hi> or Matter might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and dreſt up the Bone with <hi>liniment. Arcei</hi> warm, ſo as to give way to the Lips to fall in; I deſiring no more Opening then was neceſſary for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Matter from within. Over theſe Dreſſings I applied <hi>empl. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalcith.</hi> malaxed <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; aceto,</hi> and with Compreſſe and Bandage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſecond Dreſſing. From that time all our threatning Symptoms vaniſhed. Indeed the firſt Opening and letting bloud that ſame night reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Speech; and after this Dreſſing the uſe of his Legs was alſo reſtored: yet we kept him in the dark, and to a ſlender Diet, allowing no Fleſh. What concerned Internalls Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> took care of. The other Phyſicians and Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> coming no more, I continued the ſame method in my dreſſing untill Digeſtion, which was made in 4 or 5 days. Then I added <hi>mel roſ.</hi> in ſtead
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95669:205"/>of the Oil, and afterwards incarned, by increaſing the Reſin and leſſening the <hi>mel:</hi> the Fleſh riſing in little grains preſently after the Digeſtion was complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and after a few days covered the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> I haſtened the Exfoliation of the Bones by the application of <hi>tinctura myrrhae,</hi> and deterged the wounded Lips with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi.</hi> My work being afterwards to keep down the looſe Fleſh, I rubbed it frequently with the Vitriol or Alume-ſtone, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lips with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. whereby in leſs then ſix weeks the Bones exfoliated, and the Wound being ready to cicatrize, I left it to the neighbouring Chirurgeon; the cicatrizing of theſe being for the moſt part the work of my Servant.</p>
                     <p>A perſon was wounded near the <hi>Vertex</hi> (by a Blow I told you in the former Edition, but have been ſince informed it was) by a Puncture of a Dagger.<note place="margin">12. Obſervat. of a contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wound by a Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the Crown.</note> He ſent for a Chirurgeon, who dreſt his Wound and cured it; during which the Patient went daily abroad without any conſideration of it. About the ſeventeenth day, towards the Full-moon, as he was coming home one morning, he felt his Legs faulter, and before he was got up ſtairs into his Chamber his Tongue failed him. His Friends and Servants put him into bed, and ſent for me. They declared to me how he had been wounded ſuch a day, and the manner of his being ſeized with the <hi>Paralyſis.</hi> I ſaw a neceſſity of laying open the Hairy ſcalp, and offered to go away, that I might ſend for ſome of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to help me. He apprehending that I was leaving him as deplorable, catcht hold of me, and would have ſpoke to me, but could not. He made Signs for Pen, Ink and Paper, and endeavoured to write, but could not form one letter. He then threw himſelf down in his Bed, breathing out <hi>Jeſ.</hi> I prayed his Patience, telling him I would return ſuddenly. But before I went I let him bloud ten ounces, and returned again within an hour, and found that he had loſt the uſe of his Arms. I conſidered the Wound, and concluding a neceſſity of ſetting on a Trepan, I cauſed his Head to be preſently ſhaved, and made a circular Inciſion about the Wound. Then raiſing up the Hairy ſcalp ſmooth off with my <hi>Spatula,</hi> I both ſaw and felt the Bone, but could diſcover no fault in it. I dried up the bloud with Sponges dipt in Vinegar, raiſed up the Lips round with my <hi>Spatula</hi> from the Bone, and with a freſh Sponge having dried up the bloud, I looked again under them; but could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing ill in the bared <hi>Cranium.</hi> I then fill'd up the Wound with Doſſills of dry Lint, and applied a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> over the Lips, embrocating the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> and laid on a Cataplaſm <hi>è farin. hord. flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. in vino rubr.</hi> with <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſicc.</hi> &amp;c. That day Sr. <hi>Fr. Pruj.</hi> gave him a viſit, and preſcribed him a Clyſter, Cordialls, Juleps, and what elſe he thought neceſſary. The next day was Full-moon, at which time the Brain is thought to riſe high, and the Veſſells are turgid; wherefore I deferred the ſetting on the Trepan, contenting my ſelf with the letting him bloud again. All this while he was in a Fever, and deprived of his Speech and Lims. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, between 10 and 11 of the clock, in the preſence of Sr. <hi>Fr. Pr.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Pyle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> who thought himſelf concerned for his Servant, and had firſt dreſt him, I took off Dreſſings, and lookt into the Wound. We found no Fiſſure, however there was a neceſſity of perforating the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Wherefore without delay I began to work with the Trepan, which I much prefer before a Trephine, it being an Inſtrument which doth its work lightly, and cutteth the Bone equally, or how you pleaſe, without preſſing ſo heavily upon the Head, and is approved by all the Chirurgeons abroad, being much to be commended before the Trephine. After I had bored the Bone, and taken it out, I lookt into the hole, and ſeeing the <hi>Dura mater</hi> retaining its naturall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without Matter or Bloud, I dreſt it up with a Sindon dipt in <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> with a little Reſin warm. This way of dreſſing was objected againſt, as I expected;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95669:206"/>but I dreſt it up, and aſſured them that I would cure this Patient without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying any other Remedy to the <hi>Dura mater</hi> then theſe two ſimple Medicaments: but withall, I was much unſatisfied in my ſelf, that ſuch grievous Symptoms, as loſs of Speech and Lims, with a Fever, ſhould afflict the Patient, and yet no depreſt Bone or Fiſſure, nor ought of Matter or <hi>Sanies</hi> appear upon the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> This, I ſay, troubled me much, I fearing ſome other place, or that the bloud lay putrefied under the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> But I dreſt it up with a ſoft round Doſſil next the Sindon, and the Bone with <hi>liniment. Arcei,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the Digeſtive to the Lips of the Wound, and applied an <hi>empl. de beton, mag.</hi> over all, then laid him down in his Bed. Going preſently out of his cloſe Room (where I was crowded up with great Lights burning near me) into the freſh Air, I preſently burſt out with a violent Coughing of bloud: yet the next day I dreſt the Patient again, and found his Speech and Lims reſtored; but he was hot, and his Pulſe quick. I opened his Wound, and finding all as well as I could expect, I dreſt up the <hi>Dura mater</hi> again as before, with the ſame Oil and Reſin: and after I had bound him up as is uſuall in theſe caſes, I let him bloud 10 ounces, and adviſed the repeating of Clyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould offer. The Phyſicians and Chirurgeons viſited him no more after the firſt Dreſſing; but I retained the young Chirurgeon that had firſt dreſt his little Wound, he dwelling near the Patient. After three or four days dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, this Wound digeſted, and all the Symptoms went off. Upon which conſideration I diminiſhed the quantity of the <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and increaſed the Reſin; making good my word in curing him with thoſe ſimple Medicaments; I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and incarning as firmly and ſpeedily this way as by any Sarcotick I ever uſed. While the Bones were caſting off, I cicatrized the Lips as hath been ſet down in the preceding Obſervations. Coming one day to dreſs him while the Wound was cicatrizing, he being abroad, I ſubſtituted the young Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in my place; yet I ſaw him twice or thrice dreſed afterwards. He was well cured, and remaineth ſo to this day.</p>
                     <p>I was called to conſult with Dr. <hi>Tho. Cox</hi> about a Gentlewoman who was grievouſly diſeaſed with a great Pain between the Coronall and Sagittall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">13. Obſervat. of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the Brain.</note> occaſioned by a Blow ſhe had many months before received riding under a Pent-houſe. The Blow had ſtunned her, yet ſhe recovering her Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and viewed by ſome Chirurgeons of the City, who cured her little Wound, and returned her back: but from that time her Pain increaſed daily with a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> and ſhe returned again to <hi>London.</hi> We judged it to ariſe from that Blow, and concluded the extravaſated and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Bloud had cauſed that Pain. We viewed the Hairy ſcalp, and took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that it was thicker in the upper parts of it then was uſuall; but we could not diſtinguiſh with our fingers any inequality under it in one part or other. The Humour was pituitous, and yielded to the preſſure of the Finger, as ſuch Swellings do. She endeavoured to point to us the place with her Finger, but could not fix it within ſo narrow a compaſs as we might certainly relieve her by laying it open. At that Conſultation we reſolved to begin with Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Cataplaſms to diſcuſſe the Humour, and to make Derivation by Bleeding, Cupping, Bliſtering, and Purging: all which was afterwards done; but proving ineffectuall, we propoſed the laying open that part of the Scalp which appeared to us moſt ſuſpicious, and to ſet on a Trepan: but ſhe would not admit of it. At length, feeling her ſelf languiſhing, ſhe yielded to the making a Fontanell in the Part moſt affected by a Cauſtick. Which I did, and by Dr. <hi>Cox</hi>'s conſent I made it to the Bone, and ſo large, that I might afterwards ſet on a Trepan; and then dreſſed it with Lenients. After ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Eſcar, there appeared neither Fracture nor Fiſſure. We moiſtned the Bone with Ink, and rubbed it out again: but no mark of the Ink remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95669:206"/>I raſped it; and no Crack appearing, I ſprinkled the Bone with <hi>pulv. myrrh. aloes,</hi> &amp;c. and dreſt the Ulcer with <hi>baſilic.</hi> &amp;c. Her Pain increaſing, with other Indiſpoſitions which threatned her life, ſhe yielded to the application of a Trepan; which accordingly I ſet on, and opening the Scull, found the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra mater</hi> retaining its natural colour, but a ſmell aroſe from within as in corrupt Wounds of the Brain. I dreſt it up with Lenients as the former, <hi>viz. ol. roſ.</hi> and a little Reſin. The next day I dreſſed her again, and found the Wound digeſting; yet was ſhe extremely ſtupefied with the exceſs of pain in her Head. The third day I dreſt her again, and in the Opening found good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and a beginning to incarn, a little red Fleſh ariſing upon the <hi>Dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The next day it was increaſed, and ſo the next: but when I opened it a day or two after, I found the Lips of the Wound ſinking, and little Matter; but that which appeared was of good colour. The <hi>Dura mater</hi> ſeemed drier, the little ruddy Fleſh was not increaſed. The next day the little Fleſh upon the <hi>Dura mater</hi> beginning to look pale, I then left off the <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and added <hi>mel roſ.</hi> to the Reſin, with a little <hi>pulv. myrrhae,</hi> and a few drops of <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> and dreſt the Lips of the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilic. mag. Vigon. cum ol. terebinth.</hi> warm, laying over the bared <hi>Cranium</hi> Lint dipt in a Tincture of Myrrh, Aloes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and applying <hi>empl. melilot.</hi> with a good Compreſſe wrung out of a <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein was boiled ſome of the greater Cephalicks, as <hi>flor. anth. beton. majoran. origan.</hi> &amp;c. But that night ſhe was ſeized with Convulſions, and the day after the Lips of the Wound appeared without heat; all things looked ill; and ſhe died within a day or two after. We would have opened her Head, but ſhe had forbid it: but in bowing her Head a putrid Matter of a brown colour flowed forth her Noſtrills, of the ſame ſmell that I complained of in Trepanning the Bone, onely more foetid. I believe this Putrefaction proceeded from the corrupt bloud extravaſated between the <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura mater;</hi> which at firſt by large Bleeding and proper Applications might have been relieved. Nay poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, if we had timely opened the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> this Matter might have there diſcharged it ſelf. But if it had been attempted, and not ſucceeded, her Death would certainly have been imputed to that.</p>
                     <p>A little Girl was brought to me with a ſoft Swelling upon the left ſide of her Head, about two fingers off the Temporall Muſcle,<note place="margin">14. Obſervat. of a large Fiſſure, the <hi>Dura mater</hi> putrefied.</note> of the bigneſs and ſhape of half a great <hi>French</hi> Walnut. This Swelling happened from a Fall down a pair of Stairs ſome weeks before: but, whether through ignorance or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Fracture was not ſuſpected by them, though there were viſible Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a Concuſſion, as that of Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Child even languiſhing of it, I acquainted the Mother, that the onely way to relieve her Child was by opening that Tumour wide, and afterward I ſuppoſed that there required as much to be done to the Scull underneath. She prayed my help, and ſubmitted to the laying open the Swelling, or what elſe I ſhould think fit to be done. The way of opening this in a ſtronger Body had been, to have cut round the Tumour, and raiſed off the Skin: but the Child was ſo weak, that I feared it might the while die under my hands. Wherefore, to avoid that danger, I applied a mild Cauſtick, and delivered the Child to her Mother, who bound on the Dreſſings, and carried her home. About two hours after I took off the Cauſtick, and finding it had workt well, I divided the Eſcar, and diſcharged about three or four Spoonfull of a filthy <hi>Sanies.</hi> I took off this Cauſtick the ſooner, ſuſpecting leſt it might by longer lying penetrate through, and offend the Parts within. Upon dividing this Eſcar, the Bone appeared bare the whole length, and a long Fiſſure ran tranſverſe over from the Temporall Muſcle backward: the Scull was very thin, yielding to the leaſt preſſure of my Finger, as a piece of Vellum; ſo that I might have inlarged it with my
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95669:207"/>Knife, if I had thought it neceſſary. I bowed the Child's Head on one ſide, and dropt in a little <hi>mel roſ.</hi> with a few drops of Tincture of Myrrh, Aloes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with Pledgits dipt in the ſame lightly covered up the Bone. Then dreſt up the Eſcar with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> malaxed <hi>cum oelo liliorum,</hi> and laid a cephalick Emplaſter over all, with convenient Bandage. I continued the ſame method of dreſſing daily, and ſaw pieces of the <hi>Dura mater</hi> purge out, and hang in the fiſſured edges of the Bone; and for ſome while a thin <hi>Ichor</hi> iſſued thereout. The Eſcar being ſeparated, I dreſt the Lips with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi,</hi> and the Bone with <hi>liniment. Arcei,</hi> dropping into the Fiſſure the Balſam pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Vigo;</hi> by which it incarned, and, as the Bone exfoliated, united with the Lips of the Ulcer. There was a Tumour behind the Ear before I began the Cure: but by embrocating it with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> daily, it went off after the Digeſtion of the Ulcer above. Thus this Infant was cured: but ſhe being the product of a diſeaſed Mother, grew lame about a year after of a Pain in her right Hip, whether it happened by accident of a Fall, or that it was Strumous; but when I ſaw it, it was diſlocated. I ſuppoſe no rationall man will believe this Accident on her Head occaſioned that Defluxion on her Hip.</p>
                     <p>A Gentlewoman fell down with her Child of half a year old in her Arms.<note place="margin">15. Obſervat. of <hi>Caries</hi> through the <hi>Cranium,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and <hi>Dura mater</hi> were grown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> The Mother was hurt, and the Child a little ſcratched on the left ſide of its Head. It was viewed by ſome Pretender to skill in ſuch things, and judged inconſiderable: but from that time the Child grew indiſpoſed, and vomited often, eſpecially after the receiving her ſuſtenance; and as ſhe grew able to ſpeak, complained of a pain in that part of her Head; and by reaſon of her often vomiting and conſtant pain in her Head, ſhe languiſhed daily. After 10 years, a ſmall Tumour appeared in that part of the Head where it had been hurt. They again conſulted, and afterwards brought the Child to me a very Starveling. I viewed the Tumour, and felt in it a Pulſation, which at firſt I thought an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſma:</hi> but preſſing my Finger more into it, I felt the Membrane of the Brain without any Scull the breadth of an old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shilling. This at firſt a little amazed me: but upon conſideration of the Fall, and the Symptoms ſucceeding, it was evident to me that by the Fall the Scull was fiſſured, and being of a thin cartilaginous ſubſtance at that time of her Infancy, had through continuance mouldred away, and the <hi>Dura mater</hi> thruſting outwards, had by Adhaeſion to the <hi>Pericranium</hi> united in one body with it. This I ſuppoſed the caſe. The Preſage here was a ſudden death, if the Cure was not attempted: and in the attempting it ſhe was in great danger. To begin this Operation by a circular Inciſion, the compaſs of the Tumour in the Scull, was not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: but then to ſeparate theſe two Membranes, the <hi>Dura mater</hi> from the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> or this from that, was an hard task even in a dead Body; here in a weak Child much more, where the bloud would be apt to blind me, and the impatience of the Child render it hazzardous, the work of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requiring a great Steadineſs in both of us. Wherefore I reſolved to lay the Scalp open by Cauſtick. To which purpoſe, I forewarned them firſt of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either in leaving the Child to die by its Malady, or in attempting the Cure doubtfully. But they having conſulted others before, were ſenſible of the danger the Child was in by its Diſeaſe, and readily commended her into my hands, and lodged her near me. I cauſed the Hair to be ſhaved off from the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and applied upon it the moſt gentle Cauſtick I could deſign. At ſuch time as I thought it might have made its way through the Superficies of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> I took it off, and with a Cauſtick-ſtone rubbed into the muſculous Skin's then waſht out the Salts well, with Wine firſt, then Milk. After that I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocated it with warm Oil, and cut into the Eſcar, embrocated the Part again, and dreſt it up <hi>cum unguent. baſilic.</hi> with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> applying <hi>emplaſtrum è bolo</hi>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:95669:207"/>over all, with Compreſſe and Bandage. That night ſhe was ſeized with a fit of Convulſion, frequently vomited, and was very ill. Doctour <hi>Fiſher</hi> was fetcht, and preſcribed her a cordiall Julep proper in her caſe, and relieved her. The next morning I took off Dreſſings, and raiſed up the Hairy ſcalp round from the Scull ſo far as the Cauſtick had ſpred, whcih gave a breathing to it, and diſcharged a little <hi>Ichor.</hi> From that time her Vomiting ceaſed, as alſo the Convulſive fits, and ſhe began to be more lively then in ten years before. We kept her in bed warm and cloſe, and preſcribed her a ſlender Diet, allowing her onely Spoon-meats. Her Phyſician took care in what concerned her health by Internalls. I proceeded to haſten Digeſtion, and by Fomentations and the like to cheriſh the native heat of the Part. Some places I digeſted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I deterged. It was a nice work, but ſucceeded happily. Whilſt ſome Sloughs were ſeparating, other parts incarned and cicatrized. The Patient at length being in a fair way of Recovery, I invited Sir <hi>Ch. Scarburgh</hi> and Doctour <hi>Walter Needham</hi> to ſee her dreſſed. The <hi>Dura mater</hi> was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carned, and the edges of the Bone exfoliating; after which the Wound ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrized, and contracted to a very narrow compaſs. The Child afterwards returned to her Friends perfectly in health, and is a witty Child; but it's thought ſhe will be but a Dwarf.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Honour about ten years of age,<note place="margin">16. Obſervat. of a large Fiſſure by contuſion without a wound.</note> by accident of a Fall from his Horſe, bruiſed his Head on the right ſide a little above the Temporal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle. He was ſomewhat ſtunned by the Fall, and vomited. Going to him within an hour after, I felt a large Tumour in that place, and, judging the Scull to be fractured, propoſed the laying it open. But the Phyſician not being come, I opened the Jugular Vein on that ſide, took away ſome ounces of bloud, and prepared Dreſſings. Doctor <hi>Lowre</hi> being come, I laid open the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> by a circular Inciſion, and diſcovering a Fiſſure, filled up the place with Doſſils of dry Lint, <hi>pulv. Galeni &amp; empl. è bolo,</hi> with Compreſs and Bandage over all. The next morning we found our Patient relieved; a Clyſter was adminiſtred that day; and the day after, the Phyſician and Mr. <hi>Hollier</hi> being preſent, we took off Dreſſings, and ſaw a large Fiſſure ſtretching from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronall Suture to the Temporall Muſcle. The Seroſity being diſcharged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and the Patient freed from the preceding Symptoms, I did not think it neceſſary to ſet on a Trepan: but it being by others thought reaſonable, to prevent farther diſpute, I complied with them. But then the Patient's Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends deſired to be informed what Inſtruments we would uſe, and asked to ſee them. I ſhewed them a Trepan and Trephine, and gave them liberty to try both upon a Scull. They did ſo, and unanimouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the Trepan, which accordingly I ſet on in the declining part, ſomewhat diſtant from the Fiſſure; and after Perforation dreſſed the <hi>Dura mater</hi> with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and Reſin, the <hi>Cranium</hi> with dry Lint, and the Lips with a Digeſtive <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. then embrocated the Parts about, and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with Bandage. By the application of theſe the <hi>Dura mater</hi> digeſted, and ſoon after incarned. But the Seroſity diſcharging by the Fiſſure, the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation by the Perforation of the Trepan was ſmall, and thought not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I being deſirous to juſtifie my way of dreſſing, yet ready to comply with the common practice, dreſſed it up with <hi>mel roſ. &amp; ſpir. vini.</hi> But the Matter at next dreſſing appeared leſs; and the day after we found the ruddy Fleſh upon the <hi>Dura mater</hi> pale and withering. I applied again the <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and Reſin, and at the next dreſſing ſaw the Fleſh ruddy and better digeſted; and after a dreſſing or two the Membrane ſo incarned, that I was glad to keep it within compaſs by the application of a Doſſil of dry Lint: and from that time my buſineſs was to ſuppreſs it with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95669:208"/>During this the <hi>Cranium</hi> was dreſt with Pledgits preſt out of <hi>ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini;</hi> and while the Bone was exfoliating, we deterged and cicatrized the Lips, diſpoſing them to incarn with the Fleſh riſing from the exfoliated edges of the Bone. At length the Bone changed colour and ſhook. It appearing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards looſe. I raiſed it up with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> and took it off; we ſuppoſing it an Exfoliation. But by the Pulſation in the Fleſh under, it appeared to be both Tables of the <hi>Cranium.</hi> If you will ask the occaſion of this, I muſt tell you, that, according to our judgments, it was the effect of the Contuſion, of which there indeed appeared no marks: yet, without doubt, by the force of the Blow the heat was extinguiſhed in the Bone, and as a dead Bone it ſeparated. And this ſort of Contuſions is taken notice of by the Ancients. It is without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Patient, if there be a ſufficient Diſcharge otherwiſe for the Matter, as here there was by the Fiſſure. This Pulſation leſſened as the Fleſh grew callous and hardened, which it did ſoon after into a Bone. About which time the fiſſured Bone caſt off its edges, and that Fiſſure incarned, and ſupplied the place of the Bone; the Wound alſo cicatrized by the common Epuloticks. This young perſon had formerly been ſubject to pains in his Head and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Vomiting from his Infancy, upon which account we did not haſten the cicatrizing it; but after Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we cicatrized, and he enjoyeth a better health ſince.</p>
                     <p>A young Fellow,<note place="margin">17. Obſervat. of a Fiſſure with a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and depreſſion of the <hi>Cranium</hi> under the temporall muſcle.</note> a Maſon by Trade, being at work with others making a Stack of Chimneys three Stories high, the Foundation of the houſe ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. He was taken up ſpeechleſs; but being preſently let bloud by a Noble Lady's advice, he recovered his Senſes, and was removed to his Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The Part contuſed and ſwelled was the right Temporal Muſcle, and that ſide of his Head. He vomited often, and had ſhrewd Symptoms of a Fracture. I cauſed the Hair to be ſhaved off, and made an Inciſion in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Tumour, from his Ear forward, above two inches in length, paſſing as near the Temporal Muſcle as I durſt; and having at the ſame time divided the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> I thruſt it off from the Bone; then with a Sponge preſt out of Red wine wiped away the bloud, and ſaw a Fiſſure running the whole length of the Wound. I alſo eſpied another Fiſſure ſtretching from this downwards towards the externall <hi>Canthus</hi> of that Eye; and the lower I preſſed with my Finger, the more rough the Bone felt. I was unwilling to cut the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muſcle; but there ſeeming to me a neceſſity of it, I drew my Knife downward, and laid open the Wound in the form of a Roman T. But the lower Lips, being muſculous, would not ſo turn back to bare the fractured Bone was I deſigned; therefore I contented my ſelf with what I had done, and filled up the Wound with Doſſils of Lint, embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum album. ovi,</hi> and applying <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over it, with Compreſs and Bandage, then laid him to reſt with an Anodyne draught. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I found the Patient in a Fever. He had reſted ill, and had vomited of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and complained of much pain in that lower Jaw. I took off the Bandage and Emplaſter, and dreſt the Lips of the Wound with a Digeſtive <hi>ex tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binth.</hi> &amp;c. upon Pledgits dipt in <hi>ol. hyperici</hi> hot, embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. cham. &amp; roſ.</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. hord. flor. roſ. rub. balauſt.</hi> &amp;c. as you may find it deſcribed in the method of Cure. Then we let him bloud in that Jugular, and adviſed a Clyſter: a Ptiſan and contemperating Juleps were alſo made him. Having afterwards conſidered of the neceſſity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more way to the depreſſed Bone, and the danger which might happen by cutting off more of this Muſcle, I reſolved to conſult Doctour <hi>Walter Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> to which purpoſe I ſent to him, and he accordingly met me the next day. We found the Patient reſtleſs, and accompanied with an increaſe of all the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95669:208"/>forementioned ill Symptoms. We took off Dreſſings, and diſcerned the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lips of the Wound digeſted, but the lower more dry and ſwelled, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon the lower part of the Temporall Muſcle; upon the preſſure whereof a white Matter diſcharged from within, between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and muſculous Fleſh, where we judged the Depreſſion of the Bone to be. There was a neceſſity of cutting off part of the Temporall Muſcle, and that in the form of a Semicircle: wherefore we marked it with Ink from the upper part, ſo paſſing within an inch or more of the externall <hi>Canthus</hi> of the Eye, and carrying it towards the Ear, to take off that Lip which was lying over the Depreſſure. This being ſo marked, we cut it off. There was an effuſion of bloud out of both ends of the Arteries: but having Doſſils ready dipt in in the Royal Stiptick, we applied them; and having filled up the bared <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> with our Dreſſings, we bound up the Wound. From this time his Jaw was ſo weak, that we were forced to muffle it up with Chin-cloaths. At our next dreſſing we ſet on a Trepan: after which with a Levator we raiſed up the depreſſed Bone, and dropt into that Wound a Solution of <hi>reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in mell. roſ.</hi> We then dreſt the trepann'd hole with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> upon a ſoft Doſſill; and the reſt of the <hi>Cranium</hi> we covered with Doſſils preſt out of <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> and applied Digeſtives over the Lips of the Wound. At the ſecond Dreſſing Doctour <hi>Walt. Needham</hi> was preſent, and ſaw the <hi>Dura mater</hi> under the trepann'd Bone incarned ſo well, that from that time we onely applied a little round Doſſill to keep the Fleſh from thruſting out of it. But from the Fracture below much purulent Matter came away daily: we ſuppoſed it was the more increaſed, by reaſon of the hollowneſs which it had made between the Muſcles and fractured Bone, which being depending, did yet retain its Cavity, notwithſtanding our endeavours by Compreſs and Bandage. Therefore to prevent the enlarging of that Cavity, we applied a Cauſtick on the outſide, and the next day di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it; from which time the Matter diſcharged it ſelf that way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the internall Cavity was diſpoſed to cure. The Fiſſure that ſtretched it ſelf from his Ear towards his Brow did lie ſo undiſcovered, that we neither ſaw beginning nor ending of it; nor did we care: that part of it which we ſaw ſerved to diſcharge the <hi>Serum</hi> ſufficiently. I raſped the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and covered it up with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> &amp;c. keeping them cloſe to the Lips of the Wound; and by timely rubbing the aforeſaid Lips and every Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcreſcence with the Vitriol-ſtone, I kept the <hi>Cranium</hi> dry, and diſpoſed it to exfoliate. After the diſcharge of Matter ceaſed from within the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> I left the Exfoliation and Incarning of it to my Servants, viſiting the Patient but ſeldome my ſelf. His Wound was cicatrized in leſs then two months: as indeed they all uſually are, if they be treated as they ought. But if they fall into ſuch ignorant and obſtinate hands, who ſuffer the <hi>Cranium</hi> to be overgrown with looſe Fleſh, a great diſcharge of Matter will follow, and the <hi>Cranium</hi> muſt of neceſſity corrupt, and conſequently the Cure muſt be prolonged.</p>
                     <p>During the Wars I was frequently imployed in the dreſſing ſome one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other,<note place="margin">18. Obſervat, of a Souldier wounded in the Head.</note> wherein I have ſeen all or moſt of the ſeverall ſorts of Fractures mentioned in this Chapter. Particularly at the Battel of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier came to us where we were dreſſing, with his Sword in his hand, the Blade broken off near the Hilt, with many Wounds on his Head. I ſeeing the Hairy ſcalp of one ſide of his Head hanging down his Neck, went to him, and calling my Friend <hi>Will. Clarke</hi> to me with a Sponge to cleanſe the Wound, we ſaw ſix pieces of the Scull ſticking on it: ſome of them were of the firſt Table, others of both Tables. Beſides which there were various Fiſſures, <hi>Sedes,</hi> and ſome Fractures, with Depreſſion, made by Sword, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſtock,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95669:209"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We free the Scalp of thoſe Bones, and returned it upward ſo far as we judged it neceſſary; then cutting off what was ſuperfluous, tacked it to the ſound parts by ſeverall Stitches diſtant from one another, leaving a ſpace to dreſs the Depreſſion and greater Fractures. Then we dreſſed up the Wounds with Digeſtives <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. and where the <hi>Dura mater</hi> lay bare, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Pledgits dipt <hi>in ol. roſ.</hi> and to the other parts of the <hi>Cranium liniment. Arcei.</hi> The Alarm growing hot of the Enemies entring the Citie, I left <hi>Will. Clarke</hi> to bind it up, and made my way out of the Town. But this young Chirurgeon, being taken buſied in dreſſing the wounded Souldiers, had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after the heat of the Fight was over, to imploy his Charity in dreſſing ſome of them, and writ me ſince this Souldier's particular Caſe: <hi>viz.</hi> The third day he found him pretty hearty, and his Wounds mattering ſo very much, that he was neceſſitated to cut looſe two of the Stitches, to give vent to it: then he dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the penetrating Wounds with <hi>mel roſ.</hi> and the <hi>Cranium</hi> with Lint preſſed out of <hi>ſpir. vini;</hi> and proceeding accordingly in the Cure, ſaw the depreſſed and mangled Bones caſt off, incarn, and cicatrize with the reſt. The Souldier being thus cured by him made a Voiage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſince that ſerved a Souldier in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Penycuke,</hi> an eminent Chirurgeon of that Nation, did aſſiſt me in this work. I think the Brain it ſelf was wounded. I left her in his hands, who I ſuppoſe finiſhed the Cure.</p>

Therefore in the Cure of theſe Wounds of the Brain, I conſider the Brain as an inſenſible Body, and that the dreſſing of them conſiſts in keeping it within its Membranes, and treating it as Wounds of the Membranes with Lenients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this can be done, as in ſmall Wounds of the Brain it doth ſometimes happen, (if the Fracture of the Scull hath not been very large,) then the Patient may recover.</p>
                     <p>But if the Fracture in the Scull be large, and the Wound in the Brain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, ſo that the Brain cannot be retained within them, then it corrupts by reaſon of the externall cold, and offends the Membranes by its putrid Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and is frequently the cauſe of all the ill Accidents that attend them. The Patient ſometimes lives untill that Lobe be conſumed, or hath wrought it ſelf forth; as for Inſtance,</p>
                     <p>A Few days before the Battel at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat, of a Fracture of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> by Musket-ſhot.</note> while we were dreſſing the wounded Souldiers, one was brought to us ſhot with a Musket-bullet on the right ſide of his Head. My Servant <hi>William Clark,</hi> now dwelling at <hi>Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,</hi>
                        <pb n="402" facs="tcp:95669:210"/>in dreſſing his Wound felt the Shot ſticking deep in the Scull. I haſtened to him, and ſaw the man ſpeechleſs. We laid the <hi>Cranium</hi> bare by a circular Inciſion, and permitted it to bleed a while; then cleanſed it with a Sponge preſt out of Vinegar, and fill'd it up with dry Lint. After an hour or two, the Bleeding being ſtopt, we opened the Wound again, endeavouring to get out the Bullet: but it not yielding thereto, we ſet on a Trepan cloſe by it in a depending part, and gave vent to a quantity of bloud: then paſſing in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator we raiſed up the Bullet, and pull'd out the depreſſed Bones, with which there came away ſome bloud and a little of the Brain. This being wiped away, there appeared a large Wound in the <hi>Dura mater.</hi> We dreſt it with a Sindon dipt <hi>in ol. roſ. &amp; reſina,</hi> and fill'd up the Cavity with Doſſils of Lint. Having ſo likewiſe dreſſed up the trepann'd Bone, we applied our Digeſtives to the Lips of the Wound, with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> and Bandage over all. Before we had dreſſed him up, he lifted up his Eyes, and asked how he came amongſt us. Severall other things he demanded of us. We cauſed him afterwards to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and continued our care of him. The Wound did digeſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Brain came away each day; yet his Speech continued: but what became of him after our Defeat, I do no know.</p>
                     <p>At the Siege of <hi>Melcomb-Regis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Scull.</note> a Foot-ſouldier of Lieutenant-colonell <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi>'s, by the grazing of a Cannon-ſhot, had a great part of his Forehead carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, and the Scull fractured into many pieces, and ſome of it driven with the Hairy ſcalp into the Brain. The man fell down as dead, but after a while mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and an hour or two after, his Fellow-ſouldiers ſeeing him endeavour to riſe, fetcht me to him. I pulled out the pieces of Bones and lacerated Fleſh from amongſt the Brain, in which they were intangled, and dreſt him up with ſoft folded Linen dipt in a Cephalick Balſam, and with Emplaſter and Bandage bound him up, ſuppoſing I ſhould never dreſs him any more. Yet he lived 17 days; and the 15. day walkt from that great Corner-fort over againſt <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the Bridge which ſeparates <hi>Weymouth</hi> from <hi>Melcomb-Regis,</hi> onely led by the hand of ſome one of his Fellow-ſouldiers. The ſecond day after he fell into a <hi>Spaſmus,</hi> and died, howling like Dog; as moſt of thoſe do who have been ſo wounded. About the ſame time a Maid-ſervant was ſhot into the right ſide of her Head by a Musket-bullet deep into the Brain. She lived ſo long till that Lobe of the Brain wrought out or corrupted.</p>
                     <p>At the Siege of <hi>Taunton</hi> one of Colonell <hi>John Arundell</hi>'s men,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Face, Noſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> in ſtorming the Works, was ſhot in the Face by Caſe-ſot. He fell down, and in the Retreat was carried off among the dead, and laid into an empty houſe by the way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next day: when in the morning early, the Colonell marching by that houſe heard a knocking within againſt the Door. Some of the Officers deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to know what it was, lookt in, and ſaw this man ſtanding by the Door without Eye, Face, Noſe, or Mouth. The Col. ſent to me (my Quarters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neareſt) to dreſſe the man. I went, but was ſomewhat troubled where to begin. The Door conſiſted of two Hatches; the uppermoſt was open, and the man ſtood leaning upon the other part of the Door which was ſhut. His Face, with his Eyes, Noſe, Mouth, and forepart of the Jaws, with the Chin, was ſhot away, and the remaining parts of them driven in. One part of the Jaw hung down by his Throat, and the other part paſht into it. I ſaw the Brain working out underneath the lacerated Scalp on both ſides between his Ears and Brows. I could not ſee any advantage he could have by my Dreſſing. To have cut away the lacerated Parts here had been to expoſe the Brain to the Air. But I helpt him to clear his Throat, where was remaining the Root of his Tongue. He ſeemed to approve of my Endeavours, and implored my help by the Signs he made with his Hands. I askt him if he would drink, making a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:95669:210"/>Sign by the holding up a Finger. He preſently did the like, and immediately after held up both his Hands, expreſſing his Thirſt. A Souldier fetcht ſome Milk, and brought a little wooden Diſh to pour ſome of it down his Throat: but part of it running on both ſides, he reacht out his Hands to take the Diſh. They gave it him full of Milk. He held the Root of his Tongue down with the one Hand, and with the other poured it down his Throat, (carrying his Head backward,) and ſo got down more then a quart. After that I bound his Wounds up. The dead were removed from thence to their Graves, and freſh Straw was fetcht for him to lie upon, with an old Blanket to cover him. It was in the Summer. There we left that deplorable creature to lodge; and while we continued there, which was about 6 or 7 days, he was dreſt by ſome of the Chirurgeons with a Fomentation made of Vulnerary Plants, with a little Brandy-wine in it, and with Stupes of Tow dipt in our common Digeſtive. So we bound him up.</p>
                     <p>I could tell you of many more wounded into the Brain, but I think theſe may ſerve to prove what I would demonſtrate, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Brain is of it ſelf inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; that thoſe Symptoms which accompany theſe Wounds proceed from the pain which the <hi>Meninges, Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia mater</hi> ſuffer, which if oppreſſed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated bloud, or a Depreſſion of the Scull, do quickly ſuffer the greateſt Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, as Vomiting, <hi>Stupor, Paralyſis,</hi> &amp;c. much more if they be pricked by any Speel of a Bone, or other extraneous ſharp body. When the Brain it ſelf ouzeth out between them in the manner already mentioned, it is a mild ſoft ſubſtance and lenient to them, ſo that the Accidents appear not till that begins to corrupt between them, and with it the Membranes themſelves putrefie; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which there follow Convulſions, Howlings, and a diſpatch of the Patient. From which very obſervation may be ſeen the folly of dreſſing theſe Wounds with powerfull Deſiccatives, which, ſo far as I could obſerve, did always hurt the Membranes, but never either digeſt or incarn the Brain. For, according to <hi>Hippocrates, non coaleſcet,</hi> but as it gets liberty works it ſelf forth, not unlike unto Barm. At ſea thoſe wounded into the Brain die ſoon after, we having no conveniency of lodging them or dreſſing them ſo warm as they require. In the Wars my imployment did not permit me to ſee the finiſhing of their Cures; and here, in my practice in and about the City, I never was called unto any ſo wounded where there were any hopes of Cure; therefore muſt leave that to others to treat of. But by what I have ſeen of them heretofore, their Cure conſiſts, as I have already ſaid, in dreſſing them as Wounds of the <hi>Dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and in keeping the Brain within its Membranes; without which no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation can be made on the Membranes.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Gun-ſhot Wounds in generall.</head>
                     <p>GReat hath been the contention amongſt the Learned about Fire and Venome in Gun-ſhot Wounds,<note place="margin">Gun-ſhot Wounds whether fiery or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous.</note> ſome maintaining the one to be in them, ſome the other; and others holding that there is neither. That which I ſuppoſe might be the occaſion of their ſuſpecting a burning and a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous quality, was the deadly Colour of theſe Wounds, which in thoſe early days, when the invention of Guns was novell, ſurprized them, they looking not unlike poiſoned and burnt Wounds. Where the Bullet pierceth, it extinguiſheth the naturall heat, and the Lips of the Wound are livid or blackiſh; and if they be not dreſt rationally, they inflame, and are accompanied with Tumour, and Bliſters frequently riſe about them, alſo the Matter is of a foetid ſmell. In this condition the Wound is commonly the firſt day, and ſo to the ſeventh; and, if not ſuccoured, it gangrenes, and ſo the Patient commonly dies. If in thoſe days the Learned were thus deceived by their aſpect, and dreſt them as venomous Wounds; it can be no marvell that they ſhould write ſo of them; I verily believing, that in their way of treating them they were directly as poiſoned Wounds difficult to digeſt and cure.</p>
                     <p>In theſe our later times, although they do not call them venomous,<note place="margin">Errours in dreſſing Gun-ſhot Wounds.</note> yet is it a difficult thing to diſſwade many of our Chirurgeons from dreſſing theſe Wounds with Tinctures of Myrrh and Honey of Roſes, and thruſting in of great Tents: by which way of dreſſing I have ſeen theſe Wounds undigeſted the tenth day; one whereof was in the Cheek, with dry and ſtaggy Lips. Theſe leſſer fleſhy Wounds being undigeſted, at laſt gangrene: and in truth it is not to be wondered at; I will undertake to ſhew you the Experiment every day, and that in a Fontanell or Iſſue made by a Cauſtick. Cut you through this livid or black Eſcar, and put in a Pea in the middle of it, with Tincture of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95669:213"/>Myrrh and Honey of Roſes, as I have ſeen ſome of them dreſs Gun-ſhot Wounds, and the next two or three days after, when you dreſs it again, it will be to your ſight not unlike a Gun-ſhot Wound: continue your dreſſing with a Pea, and with your Tincture of Myrrh; and if it do not gangrene, yet it will be inflamed, and ſlow in Digeſtion. And this is from the improper Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the dreſſing it. For if you dreſſed this Eſcar in the Fontanell with Emollients and Digeſtives, as you ought to do, the Eſcar would ſeparate with Digeſtion in the worſt Habit of body: and ſo it will in Gun-ſhot Wounds with little diſtemper or difficulty, if you have timely extracted the extraneous bodies. But the ignorance in ſome, and the diſcontinuance of others in this kind of Chirurgery, hath occaſioned theſe Errours.</p>
                     <p>Thus at our entring into <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> when the <hi>King</hi> came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Army of that valiant People, a Townſman was ſhot. The Piſtol being fired by the Cheek, ſhot him through his lower Jaw and Tongue, and out at the contrary Cheek. The Chirurgeon of the Town, upon ſight of it, concluded it gangrened from the black colour, and declined the dreſſing it the way he rationally ought: upon which the Part grew exceedingly painfull, ſwelled and inflamed; it alſo gleeted much. After two days I was conſulted, and by lenient Medicaments, and good Bandage keeping up the fractured Jaw, I aſſwaged the Pain, and digeſted the Wound, leaving it in the ſame Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's hands, who cured it. In this perſon the Wound was burnt by the flame, the very Powder ſticking in ſome parts of his Cheek. This, with the Putrefaction occaſioned by the hot weather, and the improper Applications, contributed to our Brother Chirurgeon's apprehenſion. It is this ugly aſpect that puts the inconſiderate Chirurgeon out of his method, and ſo renders Gun-ſhot more difficult of Cure then otherwiſe it would be. For if ſuch Wounds were ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally dreſt, they would digeſt and heal as eaſily as any complicated Wound. What I have ſaid of Gun-ſhot, happeneth at Sea frequently by Splinter, which though it may have loſt its force to make a Wound, yet it ſometimes bruiſeth the Skin to the Fleſh ſo forcibly as to extinguiſh the naturall heat, and to make it black. If this be dreſt as a Gangrene with <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> and <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> or lapt up with a warm Stupe, the Eſcar will grow dry and parcht, and the Humours which flow plentifully to it will cauſe an Inflammation with Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and an Apoſtemation is the beſt that can be expected underneath the Eſcar, and conſequently it will terminate in a hollow Ulcer; but for the moſt part it corrupts and gangrenes. Whereas if this contuſed Eſcar were dreſſed with Lenients according to that Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates, Omne quod contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> &amp;c. and the Parts about embrocated with <hi>ol. roſ. cum album. ovor. &amp; ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and a Defenſative applied over all to prevent Defluxion, the Eſcar would ſeparate as eaſily as thoſe made in Fontanells by Cauſtick, and afterward incarn and cicatrize with much eaſe to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Many Inſtances I could give of this kind,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> but ſhall make choice of one that will give leaſt offence, and that in the outſide of the Leg. It was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what broader then a Five-ſhilling piece in Silver. How it had been dreſſed on Ship-board I will not inſiſt; but on the Shoar I ſaw it black, and the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Chirurgery had dreſſed it with <hi>ſpir. vini &amp; unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> &amp;c. till it was as hard as Shoe-leather, and the circumjacent Parts inflamed and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. I did not perceive he had ever cut into the Eſcar: if he had, it was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially done. I adviſed it to be preſently divided, and to be dreſſed warm with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. lilior.</hi> But he replied, he knew how to dreſs a Gangrene. It was no eaſy task to perſwade him out of his method: but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and thereby the Matter was diſcharged, and the Patient more eaſy, and ſooner cured.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WOunds made by Gun-ſhot are the moſt complicate ſort of Wounds that can be inflicted: for they are not onely a Solution of continuity, but have joyned with them Contuſion, Attrition, and Dilaceration, in a high and vehement kind. To this we may adde all ſorts of Fractures and Accidents, as <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> Inflammation, <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> Gangrene, and <hi>Sphacelus;</hi> beſides the extraneous bodies which are violently carried into the Wound, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Indications.<note place="margin">Compound intentions.</note> The number of the Indications in compound Affections muſt anſwer to the variety of Diſturbances. Were it a Simple Wound, the Cure of it would preſently be performed (as you have read in the preceding Treatiſe of Simple Wounds) <hi>per aſtringentia &amp; exſiccantia,</hi> by ſuch Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are of an aſtringent and drying quality. The Cure of a Wound is the Exſiccation of it. But here is always joyned with theſe that which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth the uſe of <hi>emollientia &amp; ſuppurantia;</hi> according to that of <hi>Hippocrates, Omne quod contuſum, neceſſe eſt ut putreſcat, &amp; in pus vertatur,</hi> What is contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed muſt neceſſarily putrefie, and be turned into Matter.</p>
                     <p>That which is fretted and torn muſt alſo be reduced to the whole,<note place="margin">What is torn is to be reduced to the part, or cut off.</note> or cut off, before your ordinary intention of Incarning. Moreover, in theſe Wounds, not onely the Bullet it ſelf is ordinarily lodged, but many times other ſtrange bodies are carried along with it; for Extraction of which, judicious care and induſtry are required in you. In theſe recent Wounds we very rarely have a Flux of bloud. Though the Veins and Arteries be wounded, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lie quaſht in the contuſed Fleſh, untill ſeparation of the Eſcar; and about that time, when you leaſt think on it, they may burſt out violently.<note place="margin">Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</note> I have ſeen them thus often break forth. But if ſuch Veſſells do bleed upon the receit of the Wound, and interrupt you in drawing out the extraneous bodies, you muſt endeavour to ſuppreſs the Bleeding, for thereupon depends the life of your Patient: but withall ſo proceed, that you may extract the Bullet firſt; and then be carefull, that in the reſtraining the Bleeding you bring not on a Mortification by your crowding in Doſſills. Too many Inſtances may be given hereof: therefore I rather adviſe you to uſe an actuall Cautery.</p>
                     <p>A great Haemorrhage happening to a Souldier at the Surprize of <hi>Weymouth</hi> by the Garriſon of <hi>Portland,</hi> by a ſhot through the Heel,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> I endeavoured the ſtopping the bloud by Aſtringents, Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But after all, I was put to the uſe of the actuall Cautery; which I did apply ſucceſsfully, and have ſince ſeen <hi>Botallus</hi>'s authority for it. <hi>Tutius enim eſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eam ignite ferro conſtringere.</hi> Theſe Wounds are alſo accompanied with Pain, which ought to be appeaſed by Anodynes.<note place="margin">Anodynes.</note> But you muſt be well adviſed in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, leſt you extinguiſh that ſmall remainder of heat that is left. How you ſhall deal with all theſe Inconveniences, and not adde one evill to another,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95669:214"/>I ſhall plainly deliver to you. And firſt, what muſt be firſt put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is, the Extraction of Bullets and other extraneous bodies.</p>
                     <p>The Part is at firſt dreſſing to be cleared with what diligence you can of all ſuch forrein bodies as have made violent intruſion into it,<note place="margin">Dreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently during the heat of battel.</note> while the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is warm with the heat of Battel, and the Wound freſh, and very little altered by either Air or Accidents: upon which conſideration leſs Pain muſt neceſſarily follow upon the Extraction.</p>
                     <p>In the Armado Navall of <hi>Dunkerk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neceſſity of it.</note> where we Chirurgeons were oft im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this kind of work, we after every Fight went together viſiting one anothers wounded men. It was thought amongſt us a great ſhame, if any thing of this work of Extraction were then to be done: for after the firſt and ſecond day the Wound proveth tumefied, alſo the neighbouring Parts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and ſo changed in their temper, that they conceal from your ſight both the Bullet and his companions, ſo that the place they are coucht in can hardly be known; or, being diſcovered, you cannot without hazzard of your Patient, or great trouble of the Part, make Extraction of them. In which caſe it may then be reaſonable to defer that work, and by Lenients to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>Yet if the Wound be near a Joynt, or the Shot lodged amongſt the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, it's much to be feared the Pain will not ceaſe, and conſequently the Wound will not digeſt. In which caſe the omiſſion of drawing out the Bullet may bring a Mortification. It hath been the cauſe of the death of many a brave Souldier, and is the ground of all the miſchiefs theſe Wounds are ſubject to, as Pain, Inflammation, Spaſm, Convulſion, Gangrene, <hi>Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus;</hi> what not? every Battell producing Inſtances of it, to the diſcredit of our Profeſſion. Therefore to prevent the increaſe of ſuch Accidents, neglect not to make Extraction of it one way or other.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bullet be lodged in a leſs noble Part, as in the Muſculous fleſh, you may with more ſafety content your ſelf till the ſeventh day, or till the fierceneſs of the Accidents be over, and the Wound digeſted. But withall it will require more care, for the Wound will be more painfull, and ſlow in Digeſtion, then otherwiſe it would be. Yet be the confeſſion of thoſe that allow Fire and Poiſon in it, the Bullet may lie long there, and doe little harm. Nay, I ſuppoſe there are not many but have heard of or ſeen Bullets, that, without grievance to the Patient, have continued lying long in the Fleſhy parts of wounded men. Conceive this ſpoken of Leaden Bullets; for Iron or Braſs cannot (by reaſon of their aptneſs to ruſt) remain without doing harm. However, let nothing of this encourage you; for the Bullet pierceth not any Part without carrying Rags along with it, which corrupt in the Wound, and make Apoſtemations, occaſioning a prolonging the Cure; as muſt needs be obſerved by all men in their practice.</p>
                     <p>The Servant of a Nobleman was wounded and ſhot in the Thigh by High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men.<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> The Bullet not having been extracted by his Country-Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon at the firſt Dreſſing, could not be drawn out by me at the ſecond, but occaſioned great Pain and Inflammation, burning Heat and Watchings. And although he had many other conſiderable Wounds upon him to make a Derivation, yet was his Gun-ſhot more vexatious then all the reſt, untill I extracted the Bullet, and Rags carried in with it: yet this was but a Piſtol-bullet. But after I had drawn it out, my Digeſtion became good; and by equall Bandage, with gentle Compreſſion of the Parts, I united and healed it in ten or twelve days, which I doubt would not have been cured in three months.</p>
                     <p>Nay, while any of the Rags remain in the Wound, it will never cure: but
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95669:214"/>the extraneous bodies drawn out, there is little difficulty in the healing theſe Simple Wounds, if dreſt rationally.</p>
                     <p>An Inſtance whereof I ſhall give you in a poor Souldier,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> who was ſhot at the Caſtle of <hi>Dunbar</hi> with a Musket-bullet a little above the left Clavicle, in amongſt the Muſcles of that <hi>Scapula.</hi> The Bullet was drawn out by one of my Servants, and the Wound dreſt up with Digeſtives. But ſome days after, he being brought to <hi>Saint-Johnſton</hi>'s, I found it inflamed, and very much ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. We dreſſed it up according to the method ſet down in this Treatiſe: but it apoſtemated, and mattered very much. After ſeveral unſucceſsfull Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, I made an Inciſion by the ſide of the <hi>Scapula</hi> into the Cavity, and pulled out the Rags that had been carried in by the Shot: and from that time all Accidents ceaſed, and the Wound cured ſoon after. But if ſuch be handled as ſome have lately taught, they are as ſo many poiſoned Gun-ſhot Wounds.</p>
                     <p>Now for the taking out of the Bullets, and other extraneous bodies,<note place="margin">2 methods of extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bullets.</note> there are two methods. Firſt, one to extract them by the way they went in: the other, to open the way by which they would, if their force had not failed them, have paſſed themſelves through.</p>
                     <p>For to take them out the way they were forced in,<note place="margin">Firſt, the way the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let went in.</note> you muſt place the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as near as may be gueſſed in the poſture he was in when ſhot: and if, by reaſon of his weakneſs or other infirmity, he cannot without prejudice be ſo ſituated, let him be laid in a Poſition which may as nearly anſwer it as may be, leſt ſome part of a Muſcle, Tendon or Ligament obſcure what you deſire to make manifeſt.<note place="margin">Methods of ſearch.</note> Then make ſearch for them with your Finger or Probe. The figure of theſe Wounds is always round: the Bullet forces the Fleſh in with it, and the place by which it enters preſently contracts cloſer; but its going out is more lax. You may gueſs by view of the Wound the largeneſs of the Bullet; and comparing the one with the other, make choice of a fit Inſtrument for Extraction, wherewith you ought always to be well furniſhed. Your main care in this work muſt be to find out the Bullet: but if you fail of it by ſearching into the Wound with your Probe, then try if you can feel it by handling the Parts about: it being wonderfull to conſider how theſe Shots do twirl about, at leaſt ſeem to do ſo, when the Poſture is changed in which the Wound was received.</p>
                     <p>As for example, a man hath been ſhot in the Cheek, and I have cut out the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let behind in his Neck. Another was ſhot in the outſide of the Small of one of his Legs; the whole Member extremely ſwelled and inflamed; no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of finding out the Bullet either way: at laſt by chance I felt it in the inſide of the Thigh above the Knee. And ſo another being wounded in the outſide of the Arm, I have cut out the Bullet below the <hi>Scapula.</hi> If the Bullet hath not lain in ſo long (as in ſome of theſe caſes) that the Parts are extremely pained with Inflammation and Tumour, the Pain where the Bullet lodges doth ſometime help to diſcover it.</p>
                     <p>A common Souldier, ſhot in the Breaſt through the <hi>Sternon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> lay roaring very grievouſly, complaining of a pain in his Back. I was fetched to him, and turning him on his Side, I ſaw the Bullet lie like a ſmall Wen or <hi>Scrophula</hi> thruſting out under the Skin not far from the Spine. I made Inciſion over it according to the length of the Part, and thruſt out the Bullet as eaſily as I could deſire. Then I dreſſed it with Digeſtives, the Souldier ceaſed his crying, and acknowledged before us his Pain was from the Bullet in the Skin. For indeed the Lungs and other internall Parts are ſeldome ſo ſenſible of Pain, though wounded through.</p>
                     <p>An Inſtance whereof I ſaw in one run through them with a Rapier.<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> He complained of no other pain then that externall one in his Back where the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95669:215"/>Sword paſſed out. Sometime after his being cured, he died of another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. I opened him, and ſaw his Lungs ſound, and that the pain of his Back proceeded from the edge of the Rib which had been cut by the Sword's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out. The Lungs diſcover their hurt by other Symptoms. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier died, as moſt do that are ſhot through the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>If in your ſearching for the Bullet you light on the Part, though there be no Extuberance or ought to be felt, yet his Pain there will be a good ſign of it. If no Accidents occaſioned that Pain, make your way there by Inciſion, avoiding the Veſſells, and take out the Shot, and what elſe offers it ſelf. By this you do both quit the Part of its troubleſome Lodger, and withall make way commodiouſly for diſcharge of Matter; which, in regard moſt of theſe Wounds are ſinuous, (the Bullet turning aſide when it is hindred in its journey forward,) for want of diſcharge, might in thoſe places occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> and hollow Ulcers, not without ill quality.</p>
                     <p>So a man being ſhot with a Slug near the externall <hi>Canthus</hi> of the right Eye through that Bone,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> it ſeemed to the Chirurgeon that dreſt it to have paſſed directly forwards, and accordingly he crowded in a Tent, and daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the bulk, to ſtop the Bleeding it was ſubject to. But the Bleeding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, I was fetcht, and ſaw him pull out a Tent above an inch and a half long. I caſt in ſome of the Royall Stiptick-water, and ſtopt the Flux of bloud. His Cheek was very much ſwelled, and had apoſtemated on that ſide of his Neck, and diſcharged its Matter two inches lower then the Tumour. I cut afterwards into that Tumour, and felt the Slug: it lay partly under the <hi>Os jugale</hi> or Cheek-bone. It was a wonder to me how it came there; but I drew it out: and from that time his Wound above and the Apoſtemations below cured.</p>
                     <p>In the work of Extraction,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> take great care you lay not hold of ſome Nerve or Tendon, and ſo pluck them along with the Bullet: for by ſo doing you will cauſe intolerable Pain and grievous Accidents. You muſt therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open nor dilate your Inſtrument, untill you take hold of the Bullet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the circumjacent Parts.</p>

Therefore be not diſturb'd in your thoughts, but, having taken out the Bullet or pieces of

But in recent Wounds this will not be neceſſary: for you will find by experience, that theſe Wounds will digeſt and ſuppurate without it, (and that frees them from Putrefaction.) Nor will it be always for your credit, if you conſider the quantity of Balſams we uſe in ſuch Wounds, and what prejudice ſome people may receive either by its Salivating them, or otherwiſe affecting their Spirits. Yet Praecipitate and <hi>axungia</hi> with a few drops of <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> was a common Medicament amongſt us: but I refer that to you, it being a good Remedy to reſiſt Putrefaction, and haſten ſeparation of the Eſcars.

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Accidents befalling Gun-ſhot Wounds, and of Sinuous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</head>
                     <p>BUT from the firſt to the eleventh day many Accidents are wont to happen to theſe Wounds, which not onely impede the Cure, but often, without timely help, deſtroy the Patient. And theſe are, vehement Pain, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> from whence Gangrenes and <hi>Sphaceli</hi> do frequently happen. Theſe latter take their beginning from Inflammation. Therefore I have elſewhere particularly treated of Inflammation and <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> that you, ſeeing what it is, may in its beginning prevent its increaſe.<note place="margin">Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> It commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in this caſe, either from a very ill Habit of body, or from the ill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe Wounds in the beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Remedy is, timely to prevent the Influx of Humours, and evacuate that which already affecteth the Wound. The firſt way is, by Bleeding and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:95669:217"/>Purging; both which are directed you in the firſt day's work. If you omitted that then, you muſt perform it now. The ſecond way is, by externall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. If Pain be the cauſe, you muſt ſuccour it by Anodynes, which may mitigate and repreſs the heat of the Part; of which you may have your choice in the Chapters of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> and <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> in generall; and in the firſt Chapter of the Treatiſe of Wounds, where we have particularly treated of Pains, and propoſed their Relief, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> in their Beginning with Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Repellents, and in their State by moderate Calefaction and Diſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and afterwards by Concoction of the Matter; to which Treatiſe I refer you.</p>
                     <p>The next and moſt cruell Symptom is Mortification of the Part,<note place="margin">Gangrene.</note> which very often attends great Inflammations, and is ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected when they yield not readily to Diſcutients or Suppuratives. In theſe Wounds it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens moſt commonly through a Suffocation of the naturall heat of the Part, by reaſon of the great concourſe of Humours, or too refrigerating and repellent Applications in the time of great Inflammations, which have infeebled and hindred the <hi>tranſitus</hi> of Spirits into the Part. It may be perceived by the Gleet and change of colour, it beginning to look livid; alſo by a diminution of the Tumour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you ſee ſuch a change begin, you muſt preſently prepare to withſtand a Mortification by Scarification, not onely untill the bloud come about the Lips of the Wound, but deep into it through the Eſcar to the quick, and ſuffer it to bleed freely, and make the Part ſenſibly feel, that by ſuch means you may disburthen it of part of what would have choaked it, and make way for the entrance of the operation of the Medicine. Then foment the Part with a good <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of Aſhes, to which may be added Salt and Vinegar. Or you may boil <hi>ſcord. abſinth. centaur.</hi> and ſuch like, in the aforeſaid <hi>Lixivium.</hi> After you have well fomented the place, waſh the Scarifications, and dreſs the Wound with <hi>Aegyptiac. cum theriac. Venet.</hi> diſſolved <hi>in aceto vin.</hi> adding cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then apply a Cataplaſm <hi>ex farin. hord. fabar. orobi, lupinor.</hi> decocted in ſome of the ſame <hi>Lixivium,</hi> with an addition of Oxymel to it. But as to this Matter I refer you to the particular Chapter of <hi>Gangraenae</hi> and <hi>Sphaceli,</hi> for farther directions therein. The Gangrene ſtopt, haſten ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eſcars by Digeſtives, and then deterge with <hi>mundif. ex apio &amp; Paracelſ.</hi> &amp;c. and ſo proceed with Sarcoticks and Epuloticks to finiſh the Cure.</p>
                     <p>But in the ſeparating of contuſed Parts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi> Obſervation.</note> as I have often told you, great Fluxes of bloud uſually burſt out upon us. Thus in a Patient of mine, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Shot through the inſide of the <hi>Radius,</hi> upon ſeparation of the Eſcar a great Flux of bloud happened. While I was ſtopping the firſt Orifice, which was neareſt the Artery, the bloud burſt forth of the other. Hereupon I ſtopt both the Orifices with ſome aſtringent Powders, (I ſuppoſe that of <hi>Galen</hi>'s preſcription of Aloes and Hares-fur, I moſt frequently uſing thoſe as the beſt in ſuch caſes,) rowling up the Wound with a good Compreſs dipt in a Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Decoction, laying my common Defenſative over all, and did not open it till 3 or 4 days after.<note place="margin">See Treatiſe of Wounds.</note> How ſuch Fluxes of bloud are farther to be treated, you may ſee in the Chapter of an <hi>Aneuriſma.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gun-ſhot Wounds after ſeparation of the Eſcar are apt to become Sinuous Ulcers,<note place="margin">Sinuous Ulcers.</note> eſpecially after great Fluxion, and where Bandage cannot be uſed to preſerve the Tone of the Parts, as in the upper part of the Thigh and Hip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Cavities cauſing much pain to the Patient, and difficulty and trouble to the Chirurgeon, we ſhall conſider their Cure, taking our Indication from the Parts affected, with the largeneſs of the Wound, Contuſion and Lacerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Parts: for from ſuch Wounds there muſt neceſſarily be loſs of Subſtance,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:95669:217"/>and the quantity or evill quality of the Matter muſt needs render it Sinuous, eſpecially where Bandage cannot be conveniently made to thruſt out the Matter.</p>
                     <p>And if the Bullet or any extraneous body be yet remaining within, and the Parts extremely tumefied, and troubled with pain and influx of Humours, the included body will be the more ſtreightned in its paſſage out, and render the Cure ſo much the more difficult. And if a <hi>Cacochymia</hi> or <hi>Lues Ven.</hi> be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, you will ſcarce cure your Patient without exhibiting Antivene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and Scorbutick Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to prevent Sinuoſities, you are to enlarge the Orifice at firſt, and keep it ſo wide open, that the Matter which is daily there ingendred may have free paſſage out: which if it may not by the way the Shot went in, then you muſt conſider how in another place the <hi>Sinus</hi> may diſcharge it ſelf. This being prudently effected, and the Matter thereby diſcharged, you ſhall then more eaſily perfect your Cure.</p>
                     <p>But before you make this Apertion, you muſt conſider whether by altering the poſition of the Part, or by Compreſſion with Bandage, or by hollow Tents, the Matter may not be brought out. And to make the Cure of theſe Cavities the more facil, you muſt endeavour to place the Member in ſuch a figure that the Orifice may be depending. Alſo you muſt endeavour by Stupes, Sponges, Compreſſe and good Bandage, to preſs out the Matter, that the Cavities may unite. They ſhould be wrung out of Red wine wherein have been infuſed <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. myrtill. cort. granat. balauſt. nuc. cupreſſ. ſumach, acacia.</hi> And if the Matter do not well diſcharge between Dreſſings, you muſt dreſs it the oftner. Alſo Injections may be made with a Decoction of ſome of theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>myrrh. aloes, ſarcocoll. rad. iridos, ariſtoloch. ſpir. vini, mel roſ. aq. calcis, alum.</hi> and ſuch like, to diſpoſe the Sinuoſities to heal.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in a Wound inflicted on the upper part of a Member, the Matter not being likely to diſcharge it ſelf thereout, I have by a Seton-needle perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it through; and retaining the twiſted Silk in the Ulcer till the lower Orifice was digeſted, then drawing out the Silk, I kept it open by a Tent a few days, till the upper part agglutinated; and afterward, as the Matter leſſened in the depending Orifice, I left off the uſe of the Tent, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it up.</p>
                     <p>SO in a Gun-ſhot Wound on the inſide of the Thigh,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Thigh.</note> paſſing under that <hi>Inguen</hi> ſlanting up to the <hi>Os ilion,</hi> and apoſtemating in the upper parts, it not yielding to Cure by Injections, Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I made a <hi>Cannula,</hi> through which I paſſed a Needle with a twiſted Silk, and kept in the Silk as a Seton, till I had by Gentian-roots dilated the Orifice ſufficiently for the diſcharge of Matter. To make the Perforation of the Needle more certain and eaſie, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Cauſtick firſt upon the place, the better to feel the end of the <hi>Cannula.</hi> By this Apertion the Matter diſcharged it ſelf in what poſition ſoever he lay, and he was thereby happily cured.</p>
                     <p>One was ſhot in the Face betwixt the Noſe and Eye on the right ſide into the <hi>Ethmoïdes</hi> by a Piſtol-bullet.<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a ſhot in the Face.</note> After he had been cured ſome years of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Wound in his Face, he became troubled with a fretting <hi>Ichor,</hi> which diſcharged by that Noſtrill; and eſpecially at his firſt riſing in the morning out of bed it would run half a Spoonfull of a yellowiſh colour, which had made a chop or gutter at the lower end of that Noſtrill by its acrimony. After ſome years he felt, upon bending his Head backwards or forwards, the Bullet to rowl to and fro over the Roof of his mouth. He complained to me of his Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> a little before his <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s going into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:95669:218"/>I offered to his conſideration the caſting in Injections, or paſſing a Probe into that Noſtrill downwards, to try if either way it might be waſht or thruſt downwards in the Gullet, or be excreted into his Mouth. But theſe ways had heretofore proved ineffectuall. We therefore reſolved upon the cutting through the Palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. To which purpoſe I placed him in a clear light, one holding his Head ſteady, while I cut into the Roof. But the Fleſh was ſo cloſe tied to the Bone, that it would not yield to my <hi>Spatula</hi> as I expected: wherefore I applied a bit of a Cauſtick-ſtone, and held it to the place with a Pledgit of Lint a few minuits; by which I conſumed the ſoft fleſhy part over the Bone, and afterwards cut into the Bone ſuch a hole, that in the moving of his Head I could ſee the Bullet lodged in the Hole: which encouraging us to proceed in our work, the Bullet was afterwards taken out, and he eaſed of that diſcharge of Matter which threatned a filthy carious Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. My attendance upon his <hi>Majeſty</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> hindering my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that Cure, I left him in the hands of a Chirurgeon there, and ſince have often ſeen him at Court. But the Ulcer did not cloſe up with a <hi>Callus;</hi> however the place is ſupplied by a ſmall Plate without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sinus</hi> run tranſverſe the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may then, (if you think it not ſafe to paſs a Needle in a <hi>Cannula</hi> through it, or if you cannot do it by reaſon of the make of the Part, you may then, I ſay,) make uſe of that Inſtrument deſcribed in the Treatiſe of <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> and Sinuous Ulcers <hi>in Ano,</hi> by which you may cut as aſſuredly upon the end of the Director which paſſeth within the <hi>Sinus,</hi> as if you ſaw it before you. It is commonly uſed where the end of the <hi>Sinus</hi> lieth moſt diſtant from the Skin. After which Apertion it muſt be kept open by a Tent, for the diſcharge of Matter, till it be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and fit to cure. If the Orifice be ſmall, and the <hi>Sinus</hi> lie but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Skin, and in ſuch a place as may be ſafely opened, it may be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with prepared Sponge, or Gentian-roots, and afterwards ſnipt open by a pair of Probe-ſciſſors, or cut by a Knife upon the Director within, or laid open by Cauſtick. And after you have divided the <hi>Sinus,</hi> you may digeſt it with <hi>terebinth. cum vitell. ovor.</hi> or deterge by ſome of the Mundificatives ſet down in the Cure of Ulcers in generall: and if there be occaſion of more Sarcoticks, you may adde <hi>mel comm. pulv. myrrhae, thuris, rad. ireos,</hi> to make it more exſiccant. But commonly, the depending part once opened, the Wound cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in few days by Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as above ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But if after all your endeavours theſe Ulcers grow Fiſtulous, you ſhall find the Cure of them in another place.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Gun-ſhot Wounds with Fracture.</head>
                     <p>HAving declared unto you the way of curing Gun-ſhot Wounds in the ſoft and fleſhy Parts, I purpoſe now to proceed to the curing them as they are complicated with Fracture of the Bones, whoſe firmneſs, drineſs, ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſolidity, cannot defend them from theſe Inconveniences; nay, in the caſe I am to ſpeak of, they are rather Diſcommodities. For when the Bullet ſtriketh like Lightning, were they ſofter, it were the better, that the Bullet might paſs, and not ſhatter them. There is not any of the five ſorts of Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mentioned by the Ancients which theſe Blows will not occaſion. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will cleave the Bone <hi>aſſulatim,</hi> according to the length; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while they will break it athwart; other times they will divide it like the Scales of a Fiſh. Nay, if the Bones be drier then ordinary, (as in elderly men, and ſuch in whom nature or Diſeaſes have made them ſo,) they will grind the Bone like Meal. Yet I have ſeen and dreſt a Souldier that hath been ſhot through the Joint of the Ancle without ever breaking the leaſt part of the Cartilage.</p>
                     <p>The ways to know when there is a Fracture in the Bone are many.<note place="margin">Signs of Fractures.</note>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> bids us compare the ſound Parts with the Parts affected, and obſerve the inequality.</item>
                        <item>2. You ſhall perceive a Cavity, if you touch the Parts above and under the Fracture.</item>
                        <item>3. If you handle the fractured Member, you ſhall perceive a craſhing of Bones, by reaſon of the mutuall attrition of the hard bodies.</item>
                        <item>4. There will be extraordinary Pain, in regard of the divulſion of the Nerves, and diſtortion of the Tendonous bodies; alſo a pricking in the Fleſhy parts by the ſharp ends or Shivers of ſome Bone.</item>
                        <item>5. There will be an impotency of the broken Member, ſo that the Patient cannot lean upon it.</item>
                        <item>6. The antecedent cauſe (Gun-ſhot) will teach much in this caſe, then which there never was (nor ever will be I believe) invented a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full one.</item>
                        <item>7. The aſperity and inequality or roughneſs of the Bone manifeſt it to you: but the ſearch will give you no ſmall aſſurance.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Concerning Prognoſticks, you ſhall underſtand,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Bones receive a quicker Agglutination in Sanguine then in Cholerick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by reaſon of the benignity of the <hi>Serum,</hi> which ſendeth out better mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Bones are broke with leſs danger in the middle then near the Joint, where they are both more hard to be reſtored, and to be kept ſo reſtored; and becauſe of the multitude of Symptoms, (which in ſuch Wounds cannot but ſupervene,) are not without great difficulty to be cured.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And laſtly, thoſe Fractures are moſt dangerous which are made ſo deep in the Fleſhy parts, that your hands cannot well come at them, to extract the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95669:219"/>looſe Bones, and place the other right, and retain them ſo by Bandage; as thoſe of the <hi>Pubes, Os ilion, ſacrum,</hi> &amp;c. So alſo all thoſe Fractures made by Splinter are exceeding dangerous, they generally ſhattering the Bone to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in which caſe the Nerves, Tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are grievouſly pricked and torn, and are ſubject to extraordinary Pain, Inflammation, Convulſions, and Death, unleſs immediate Remedy be had by removing thoſe Bones, or by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Member.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Cruiſers in private Fregats from <hi>Dunkerk</hi> it was complained, that their Chirurgeons were too active in amputating thoſe fractured Members. As in truth there are ſuch ſilly Brothers, who will brag of the many they have diſmembred, and think that way to lie themſelves into credit. But they that truly underſtand Amputation and their Trade, well know how villainous a thing it is to glory in ſuch a work.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory you will find it was not allowed at all: <hi>Livy</hi> tells you their reward amongſt them. But later experience judgeth it commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it be neceſſary, and in ſuch ſhattered Lims where there is no hope of preſerving the Patient's life otherwiſe. And then it muſt be done in its proper time, that is to ſay, ſuddenly upon the receipt of the Wound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Patient's Spirits be over-heated either with Pain, Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the neceſſity of doing it ſpeedily I ſhall here give you one remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Souldier was brought to me out of the field at the Battel of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> ſhot with a Musket-bullet into the Elbow-joint,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> which fractured not onely the ends of the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> but likewiſe that of the <hi>Adjutorium.</hi> Upon ſight whereof I called <hi>Will. Clarke</hi> (now a Chirurgeon at <hi>Bridgenorth</hi>) and other my Servants about me, to cut off the Arm, and the while I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to encourage the Souldier to endure it. In anſwer thereto he onely cried, Give me drink, and I will die. They did give him drink, and he made good his promiſe, and died ſoon after; yet had no other Wound then that. By which may be perceived the danger in delaying this work to the next day, when the foreſaid Accidents have kept them watching all night, and totally debilitated their Spirits. Which happens not, if it be done in heat of Fight; for then, while they are ſurprized and as it were amazed with the Accident, the Lim is taken off much eaſier: and if it be the Arm, ſome of them will ſcarce be kept in the Hold while the Ship is cloſe engaged in Fight. In the heat of Fight I cut off a man's Arm, and after he was laid down, the Fight growing hotter, he ran up, and helpt to traverſe a Gun. And a <hi>Walloon</hi> earneſtly begged of me to cut off his ſhattered Leg: which whilſt I was doing, he cried, <hi>Depeche vous connous vendrone a terre mous bioron.</hi> Alſo others have urged me to diſmember their ſhattered Lims at ſuch a time, when the next day they have profeſt rather to die. But amongſt us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board in that Service it was counted a great ſhame to the Chirurgeon, if that Operation were left to be done the next day, when Symptoms were upon the Patient, and he ſpent with Watchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore you are to conſider well the Member, and if you have no probable hope of Sanation, cut it off quickly, while the Souldier is heated and in mettle. But if there be hopes of Cure, proceed rationally to a right and methodicall Healing of ſuch Wounds; it being more for your Credit to ſave one Member, then to cut off many. This following method is the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Cleanſe the Wound firſt from all ſtrange bodies,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> as Bullets, Armour, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and Shivers of Bones; ſo ſhall the Cure ſucceed more happily. For inſtance;</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> A Gentleman-Voluntier skirmiſhing with the Enemy before the City of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95669:219"/>
                        <hi>Worceſter,</hi> was brought to us run through his Arm in the middle of the <hi>Biceps</hi> with a Sword, and ſhot with a Musket-bullet in the ſame Shoulder under the <hi>Os ſcapulae,</hi> which took away the <hi>Coracoïdes,</hi> and tore the Ligaments in other parts of the Joint. We dreſſed the Wound inflicted by the Sword with Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinatives, healing it by the firſt Intention. We inlarged the Gun-ſhot Wound, pulled out the Bullet and pieces of the <hi>Coracoïdes,</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed it up with Digeſtives and lenient Embrocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards deterged with <hi>mundif. Paracelſi.</hi> He being <hi>Will. Clark</hi>'s acquaintance, he took care of him, and haſtened the Exfoliation of the Bones with <hi>mel roſ. &amp; ſpir. vini.</hi> Afterwards, being near cured, he made his eſcape into his own Country. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtances of this kind may be given, if it were neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>If the Fracture be near a Joint, the violence of the Blow will many times adde a Diſlocation alſo to it. If that happen, reſtore the Joint firſt to its place, before you meddle with the Fracture. Theſe Diſlocations are made by great Shot or Splinters of wood, whoſe force ſhatters the Lims in pieces, or carries them quite away. But this latter rarely happens, but uſually when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ſhattered, it hangs by ſome little part of a Tendon, Muſculous fleſh, or Skin. In which caſe your work is, with a good Razour or Knife preſently to plain the Stump, and pull up the Fleſh,<note place="margin">Smooth the Stump.</note> that you may ſaw off the end of the Bone cloſe to it.</p>
                     <p>One had his Arm ſhot off above the Elbow.<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> We dreſt him up at firſt in haſte, and at the next dreſſing his Shoulder proved out of Joint. We could not ſet it, by reaſon of the anguiſh of the Stump; which was a greater Pain to him then his Wound, and troubled him many months after. But ſo it happened, and in ſhort Stumps it is remedileſs. One of our Captain-Reformadoes had been ſerved ſo formerly with his ſtumpt Arm.</p>
                     <p>If you will endeavour the remedying it, you muſt doe it by help of a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage made above the Stump. But if it be above the Elbow, how will you faſten it. Yet in ſome bodies the Bone will be reſtored eaſily: therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it before you dreſs the Member.</p>
                     <p>In another that had his Leg ſhot off,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> in the place of Amputation below the Knee, ſome two months after, when I wondred the Bone did not exfoliate, I put in my <hi>Forceps</hi> to try whether any part of the Bone was looſe: and finding it very looſe, I took hold of it gently, and feeling it willing to come away, I pulled it out. It was the <hi>Apophyſis</hi> or head of the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> which makes the Knee. I was ſurprized at it; but conſidering what was looſe muſt away, I pulled it out, to the amazement of the lookers on. This was relaxt from its Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the force of the Blow.</p>
                     <p>In theſe fractured Wounds made by Gun-ſhot the Chirurgeon ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two things to himſelf; firſt the Fracture, and then the Wound. To proceed orderly, you begin with the Fracture,<note place="margin">Extenſion.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> with the Extenſion and Coaptation, that thereby the Fracture may be reduced to its proper ſeat: which in all theſe caſes muſt be performed with much ſteadineſs and diſcretion; not with ſuch force as in thoſe Fractures that are without a Wound, leſt the Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or Nervous parts, being torn, bruiſed or cruſhed, ſhould ſuffer extreme Pain, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before you begin this Operation, if the Wound be not large enough, make it ſo, that you may be better pull out the extraneous bodies, whether Slug, Bullet, Rags, Splinters, or Shivers of Bones; ſo ſhall the Extenſion be made the eaſier, and be leſs ſubject to Inflammation, though you ſhould not ſet it at that inſtant; for a ſmall Extenſion will afterwards ſerve. Whereas if the Wound be not ſo cleanſed, thoſe extraneous bodies, nay the ſmalleſt Shivers of the Bone, will raiſe ſuch diſturbance as will render it incapable of Digeſtion. Therefore what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith of attending to the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:95669:220"/>3.7. or 11. day, in caſe the Fracture be not reduced before Inflammation, would in theſe caſes never be; for by that time the beſt that could be expected would be Apoſtemations and crude Tumours, too big to be diſcuſſed. Therefore however the Reduction of the Fracture may have been omitted, yet it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove the Chirurgeon then conſulted to extract the extraneous bodies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, ſo ſhall it lie more quiet, and fitter for Reduction at his more leiſure. But to avoid theſe Inconveniences, make your Extenſion ſo ſoon as you may, and reſtore the Bones to their former place with what gentle dexterity and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you can poſſibly. If the Wound be narrow, dilate it, as I have ſaid, by Inciſion at the firſt: for theſe Wounds require more Dilatation then any other, that not onely the bruiſed and vitiated Bloud and other Excrements may have a free paſſage, but alſo by this means the Shivers of Bones (of which theſe Wounds uſe to be very full) may with leſs trouble be extracted by your ſelves, or diſcharged by Nature.</p>
                     <p>If you make not this Dilatation in the beginning, you may afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be forced to do it when the Part is accompanied with great Defluxion and Pain, or when the Bones are corrupt by retention of the Matter: and what condition it will then be in to admit of Inciſion, may eaſily be gueſſed by any one that hath common ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>After it is laid open, conſider whether the Bone be bare or not; which you may ſatisfie your ſelf in by your Eye, Finger, or Probe. If it be bare, you muſt apply next to it ſome dry or exſiccant Medicine;<note place="margin">Dreſſing of Gun-ſhot with Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                        <hi>Sicca ſiccis gaudent;</hi> dry to dry. Of this ſort are dry Lint, Powders of the Roots of <hi>Iris,</hi> Myrrh, Aloes, <hi>Thus,</hi> &amp;c. Forbear the application of greazie Medicaments to it, for they make the Bones foul, and hinder <hi>Callus.</hi> Yet the Parts adjacent require Digeſtion; therefore apply over them your Suppuratives warm, ſuch as have been propoſed in Simple Gun-ſhot. Then dreſs up the fractured Member with <hi>empl. è bolo,</hi> or this following: ℞ <hi>empl. diachalcith.</hi> with the addition of <hi>colophon. pulv. rad. conſolid. maj. boli Armen. cort. granator. ſucc. plantag. cum ol. myrtill. &amp; lumbricor. an. q. ſ. Miſc. &amp; fiat Emplaſt.</hi> Then apply over the Wound a Stupe or double Cloaths wrung out of Red wine wherein have been infuſed <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. ſumach, bacc. myrtill. ſummit. abſinth.</hi> or ſuch like. This Compreſſe will ſerve to keep the Lips of the Wound ſmooth, and defend it from the injury it may receive by Bandage.</p>
                     <p>The next thing which is required in theſe fractured Wounds is Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:<note place="margin">Deligation.</note> for unleſs they be rightly fitted, none of theſe Fractures, of what ſort ſoever, can be well united. In ſimple Fractures without a Wound, all kind of Bandage may be admitted; whereof you may ſee in my Lecture of theſe Fractures various ſorts, with many Circumvolutions about the Member. And once opening in ſeven days will ſerve their turn.<note place="margin">Bandage to be daily looſened in Gun-ſhot Wounds with Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> But in theſe another method of binding is required; for here the Bandage is to be looſened daily, and the Wounds to be lookt into and dreſt, they being here to be long kept open for diſcharge of excrementitious and purulent Matter, with which they abound, alſo for the Exfoliation of carious Bones, which lying there would corrupt the ſound ones.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in theſe kind of Wounds you muſt uſe ſuch a Bandage as may leaſt ſhake the fractured Members.<note place="margin">Manner of Bandage in Gun-ſhot Wounds with Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> For they being every day to be dreſt, the ſo often rowling them up would cauſe grievous Pains, and hinder union. Therefore it is that Authours have invented ſo many kinds of Bandage, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Intentions of dreſſing them, and yet keep the Member immovable. Your Bandage in this caſe is to be made of ſofter and broader Linen cloaths then what we uſe in Simple Fractures, that it may comprehend both the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Wound, and keep the Lips down, yet not hurt them by its too hard Compreſſion.</p>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:95669:220"/>
                     <p>Therefore we make choice of a piece of Cloath folded three or four times double, to give it the more ſtrength, and of ſuch a breadth as may incompaſs the Lips of the Wound and the fractured Parts, alſo of ſuch a length as to come once about the Fracture. This Cloath muſt have three Slits from the ends to the middle, which middle muſt lie undivided underneath, to bear more equally the fractured Member, and the ends muſt come over one another with a Compreſs between over the Wound, to preſs the Lips thereof equally down, which would otherwiſe become crude, and pout out with great Lips. The Compreſſe alſo ſerves to receive the Matter, and fill up the Inequality. Theſe are ſo to be faſtened, that you may dreſs and undreſs the Wound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing the Member.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it happeneth, that in theſe Gun-ſhot Wounds the Bones are ſhrewdly ſhattered, and the Wound lacerated, and by reaſon of the largeneſs of the Fracture and Wound it is extremely painfull, the Member alſo is rendred ſo weak, that it cannot be kept ſteady by this Bandage; therefore we make uſe of <hi>Ferulae</hi> or Splints,<note place="margin">Splints.</note> whereof I have made mention in my Lecture of Fractures in generall, with the Judgments of the Ancients, who have been very indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in contriving ways to make equall Compreſſion, and leave a way for the dreſſing of theſe compound Fractures.</p>
                     <p>They are not to be uſed till the Inflammation and Flux of Humours be off,<note place="margin">When to be uſed.</note> which is not untill the ſeventh day; during which we uſe <hi>Splenia,</hi> which are linen Cloaths folded four times double, and cut in length and breadth like the <hi>Ferulae.</hi> Theſe are to be ſpred with <hi>Galen</hi>'s Cerote, or any Ointment, that ſo they may adhere to the Part onely untill you have put the Bandage over it. And this is that I propoſe in all Fractures where there is Pain, and fear of Inflammation, and is eſpecially neceſſary in theſe.</p>
                     <p>They will handſomly ſtrengthen the Part, and make ſuch equall Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Bones may be kept in their place, the ſerous Humours preſt out of the <hi>Cavernulae,</hi> and the fractured Member lie ſoft; which is a great help in theſe Wounds, the whole welfare of the Patient depending upon the eaſie Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Poſition of the Member. The Pain and Inflammation gone off, and the Wound digeſted, (if you think the Member not ſo ſubject to Inflammation, or that it requireth a greater ſtrength to ſupport it,) you may uſe Paſtboard cut into pieces proportionable to lay over thoſe <hi>Splenia:</hi> or, having faſtned the <hi>Splenia</hi> by the broad Bandage with three heads, cut a piece of Paſtboard fit to receive the lower part of the Member, and leave a place commodious for dreſſing the Wound. Over the other part of the fractured Member you muſt place another piece of Paſtboard to anſwer unto the former. Theſe ought to be wet, that they may lie more pliant. About the Paſtboard make a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with three Ligatures, which you muſt faſten in the moſt convenient place for the eaſe of the Patient. But if the <hi>Splenia</hi> be wet in Whites of eggs, and applied, they will ſtrengthen the Member, and alſo keep it ſteady, without thoſe.</p>
                     <p>If you think thoſe of Paſtboard not ſtrong enough, you may uſe <hi>Laminae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Laminae</hi> or Plates.</note> Copper or Tin-plates lined with ſoft Linings, to receive the fractured Member, with Loops in the outſide, to receive the three Ligatures anſwerable to thoſe which lie underneath next the Plaiſter, that they may be faſtened and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at pleaſure, without diſturbing the Fracture, in the daily dreſſing of the Wound. And if it be in the Thighs, the Plates are beſt; theſe Parts requiring ſuch as are of great ſtrength and length, and of ſuch compaſs as may take in the lower half of the Member. Theſe <hi>Laminae,</hi> or whatever elſe you uſe, muſt have a large Hole cut in them for the Wound to be dreſt through.</p>
                     <p>But I have always obſerved inconvenience in theſe Plates; that there is
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95669:221"/>not ſo good Compreſſion made upon the Lips of the Wound through thoſe holes as to hinder them from thruſting out; whence there ariſeth a Laxity and Indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the Wound; and beſides, the Matter that ſo diſchargeth heats the Parts, and in hot weather corrupts and breeds Maggots. Therefore I make the Paſtboard or <hi>Laminae</hi> over my firſt Bandage to incompaſs ſo much of the lower parts as may ſupport the Fracture, and come within an inch of the Wound; and over the Wound it ſelf I faſten a <hi>Splenium</hi> of Cloath folded four times double, or a <hi>Ferula</hi> of Tin, Copper, or Paſtboard, lined according as I judge the Part can bear, and ſuch as may be taken off at each dreſſing.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Bandage next to my Cerote makes an equall Compreſſion by its three heads meeting over one another: the lowermoſt preſſeth the Humours from below upward, and with the help of its next fellow keeps the Bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and forceth the Matter out of the Wound: alſo, by the help this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Bracer hath of the uppermoſt, the Matter is preſt out of the upper part of the Fracture and Wound to the Orifice: it alſo reſtraineth the influx of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from above, by virtue of the Defenſative lying under it. In the dreſſing theſe Wounds, you are onely to undoe the middle Binder to come at the Wound; having a ſpeciall care that this Bandage be neither too hard nor ſlack, but indifferently made, to the eaſe of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Having thus propoſed to you the way of Deligation, I ſhall now proceed to the laſt Operation performed in theſe Fractures of a Wound,<note place="margin">Poſition of the Part.</note> which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Poſition or placing of the Member, which (as I have told you in the Lecture of Simple Fractures) ought to have three Conditions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It muſt lie ſoft, leſt the Compreſſion offend the hurt Parts, and cauſe Pain and Inflammation.</item>
                        <item>2. Equall: for if the Member be placed otherwiſe, it becomes diſtorted, and the Operation ſucceeds ill.</item>
                        <item>3. Laſtly, it muſt lie higher then the Parts next the body, eſpecially the firſt three or four days. For if it incline downwards, the Humours by their own weight will eaſily flow to the Part afflicted. How this Poſition is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I have ſet down in the Lecture of Simple Fractures, to which I refer you.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The fractured Bones of the wounded Part thus reſtored to their naturall places, and the Wound digeſted, alſo the Inflammation and other Accidents gone off, which is commonly about the ſeventh or ninth day, you ſhall then unlooſe the Bandage, take off your reſtrictive Medicament, and apply the <hi>Emplaſtr. catagmat.</hi> in our <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory (or ſome of theſe under-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) over the fractured Member, which may adde ſtrength to the Part, and further the generation of <hi>Callus.</hi> ℞ <hi>reſinae abiet. cerae, an.</hi>

                     <p>After the ninth day we ſuppoſe the Wound well digeſted; therefore we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the uſe of Suppuratives, and uſe ſuch Medicines as are detergent, as the <hi>mundif. Paracelſi:</hi> or, if you pleaſe, ℞ <hi>vincae pervincae, peti, perſicariae, beton.

                     <p>A Souldier being ſhot by a Musket-bullet into the force-part of the Arm near the <hi>Biceps,</hi> it fractured the Bone, and paſſed quite through.<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Arm.</note> I endeavoured by Extenſion to place the fractured Bone even together, but could not: upon which I dilated the latter Orifice by a large Inciſion according to the rectitude of the Member, to pull out thoſe Fragments of Bones which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their right Coaptation; and putting my Finger into the Wounds to that purpoſe, I pulled out a ragged piece of a Bullet; whether it was part of that which had paſſed through was the queſtion. Some of the By-ſtanders thought he was ſhot with a brace of Bullets: but I rather think the Bullet was torn by the Bone, and that this part was it which had made its way through. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by this Extraction the main Bone was rightly placed, the Shivers with the extraneous bodies removed, the Matter happily diſcharged by this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Orifice, and the Patient was cured by the common Intentions of Healing theſe fractured Gun-ſhot Wounds. Whereas, if I had taken it for granted that the Bullet was paſſed through, and contented my ſelf in having endeavoured the reducing of the fractured Bones, and ſo dreſt him up, it had certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and gangrened. This confirms that Doctrine in ſetting of Bones, that if any Bone will not be placed equally amongſt his fellows, you ought to cut upon it, and take it out.</p>
                     <p>In heat of Fight at Sea, amongſt the many wounded men that were put down into the Hold to men,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Facture made by a Splinter.</note> one of them had his right Arm extremely ſhatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about two fingers breadth, on the outſide above the Elbow, by a great Splinter. I ought to have cut off this man's Arm preſently: but a ſudden cry that our Ship was on fire put me in ſuch diſorder, that I rather thought of ſaving my ſelf then dreſſing my Patients. I haſtily clapt a Dreſſing upon the Wound, and rowled it up, leaving his Arm in his other Hand to ſupport it, and endeavoured to get up out of the Hold as the others did, verily believing I ſhould never dreſs him nor any of them more. But our men bravely quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves of the Fire-ſhip by cutting the Sprit-ſail-Tackle off with their ſhort Hatchets, (which they wore during Fight ſticking in ther Saſhes.) So we were freed of the Fire, and by our hoiſting up the Top-ſails got clear of our Enemy, and I returned to my work. But I was at a loſs what to doe with
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95669:222"/>this man, who lay not far off complaining of his Arm. I would have cut it off inſtantly with a Razour, (for the Bone being ſhattered, there needed no Saw:) but the man would not ſuffer me to meddle with his Arm, he crying, it was already dreſt.</p>
                     <p>The Fight being over, and we gotten into the next Port, I cauſed this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner's Bed to be ſet up: (which was four pieces of Wood nailed together and corded, and a Bear's Skin laid upon it, and faſtened between two Guns to the Carriages:) upon this I ſaw him placed; and having ordered his Arm to be laid ſo that I might the better come to dreſs it, I ſent for Dreſſings, and laid them orderly upon a ſmall Pillow well ſtuft and quilted in the middle. Upon this Pillow I firſt laid a ſoft double linen Cloath, next to that three Ligatures, then a Paſtboard wet in Vinegar, to make it more ſoft and pliant; upon that I laid a double Cloath, of ſuch length and breadth as might ſerve to encompaſs the fractured Member, which I cut from each end to the middle into three Binders: over the middle of this I placed a <hi>Splenium</hi> of Cloath four double, four fingers in breadth, and of ſuch a length as to give ſtrength to the Fracture: over this lay my Defenſative ſpred upon a thick Cloath, of ſuch a breadth and length as to take in the whole Arm. Dreſſings thus laid upon the Pillow, I cut off the other from his fractured Arm, and placed the Pillow with theſe Dreſſings cloſe by his Side; ſo that I ſaw his Arm laid as I deſigned upon my Reſtrictive, and his Hand upon his Breaſt. Then putting my Fingers into his Wound, I pulled out firſt a piece of a Splinter an inch thick or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, more or leſſe; then Rags and Bones, great and ſmall; I left not the leaſt Shiver. When I had ſo cleared the Wound of all the extraneous bodies and looſe Bones, I was amazed to feel what a void ſpace there was between the ends of the Bones. But I proceeded, and cut off the lacerated Lips, which were of no uſe, and dreſt up the ends of the Bones with a couple of Doſſils dipt in <hi>ſpir. vini</hi> and <hi>mel roſe.</hi> warm. The reſt of the Wound, and upon Pledgits without, with an <hi>empl. diachalcith.</hi> malaxt with <hi>ol. myrtill.</hi> over all the Wound. Then I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocated the fractured Arm <hi>cum ol. myrt. &amp; olivar. immatur.</hi> and a little <hi>ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> bringing my reſtrictive Emplaſter, which lay under the Arm, over the whole Arm, from the Arm-pit to the Elbow and cloſe round about, onely leaving a ſpace to dreſs the Wound.</p>
                     <p>This gave a ſtrength to the weak Member, and was deſigned to prevent the Influx from above. Juſt under this Emplaſter there lay a <hi>Splenium.</hi> To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that I applied three more, one on each ſide, and another above: which four were of ſuch a ſize, that they, lying a little off from one another, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Arm. They were ſpred lightly with a little Cerote made of <hi>ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ungia</hi> and Wax, to make them adhere where I placed them.</p>
                     <p>Then I brought the Bandage which lay under the <hi>Splenium,</hi> with three heads at each end. The lowermoſt of theſe took in the lower part of the Arm, from the Elbow upward, with part of the Fracture, and was faſtened on the exteriour part of the Arm. This preſt the <hi>Sanies</hi> from the neather part of the Arm to the Wound, and hindred the lapſe of Matter that way. The middlemoſt was made to preſs the Matter out of the Wound, and keep the Lips down. The uppermoſt ſerved to reſtrain the Influx, as I ſaid, and preſſed that Matter out which was already in the Part. This Bandage was made with great moderation, and ſo faſtened, that it might be looſened without trouble to the Patient. Then I brought the wet Paſtboard cloſe to the ſides, and cut another piece to anſwer it, which I wetted <hi>in aceto,</hi> and by the three Ligatures under made them faſt, but without diſturbance to the Patient. If it could not have
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95669:222"/>been ſo put on, I ſhould have forborn the uſe of them, the Cure of theſe Wounds conſiſting in the eaſie Dreſſing and quiet Poſition, without which you will not cure one of them. The Paſtboard as it dried, ſtiffened, and retained its ſhape, preſerving the Fracture in the poſition I left it, and that with a very ſlack Bandage. Thus I finiſhed the firſt dreſſing, leaving my Patient in much eaſe. He ſlept pretty well that night, and was the next day as well as I could expect. He was let bloud the ſecond day, and kept to a ſpare Diet: but we allowed Wine as a Cordiall to all our Patients.</p>
                     <p>The third day I dreſt him again, took off the upper Paſtboard, and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heads of the main Bandage; alſo I took off that <hi>Splenium</hi> which was over the Wound, and raiſing up the Emplaſter from the Wound, took out many Doſſills, found it warm and well diſpoſed, and dreſt it up quick with my Suppuratives hot, and an Emplaſter as before, I ſtirred not the Reſtrictive, but made now a Compreſs more particularly for the Wound, purpoſing not to remove the two outermoſt heads of the main Bandage, unleſs it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to give a little breathing to the Member: but themiddle I opened as often as I thought fit, to dreſs the Wound. The other two had ſhort <hi>Splenia</hi> to make the Bandage equall. But I was not then ſatisfied how the ſpace between the fractured ends of the main Bond could be ſupplied with <hi>Callus.</hi> My Patient was eaſier then any of my other with fractured Wounds. When it came to my turn to be viſited by my Brother Chirurgeons of our Squadron, they did not diſlike the Wound, nor my way of dreſſing, (for we being uſed to ſee one another's Patients, had all much one way of dreſſing:) but they laught at the excuſe I made for not cutting off his Arm, and doubted I ſhould yet be forced to do it. But I kept my Patient flat on his Back, and that after a while was his greateſt pain; for the Wound digeſted, and the Tumour was not then conſiderable. After the Wound was well digeſted, and the bruiſed Fleſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, I renewed the Dreſſings, taking all the old ones off, and fomented the Member with warm Water, to give a breathing to it; then applied a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagmatick Emplaſter, dreſt the Wound with <hi>mundificat. Paracelſi</hi> or ſuch like, and bound up the Member as at firſt, and ſo continued my way of Dreſſing as I ſaw cauſe, putting into the Wound onely a Doſſill or Tent made upon a Skewer ſoft and hollow, to give way to the Wound to incarn; I ſcarce uſing any Injection, but by gentle Compreſſion aſſiſting Nature, who ſeldome fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in ſupplying the loſt Subſtance in Wounds, if we diſturb her not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Applications. The next taking off and renewing theſe Dreſſings of this fractured Member was occaſioned ſome 16 or 17 days after, by a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome itching of the Part, which was occaſioned, I ſuppoſe, partly from his liberty in Diet, partly by the heat of the Weather, and want of Tranſpiration. Upon this account I took off the Dreſſings, bathed the Member with Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and dreſt him up with <hi>emplaſt. de lithargyro.</hi> The Wound was about this time well incarned within, and the Lips beginning to cicatrize from their edges, I dreſſed them with Epuloticks, as <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. All this while I kept my Patient upon his Back, and renewed not the whole Dreſſing untill I was again neceſſitated. One day coming from the Shoar, (where our woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men had liberty to lodge if they deſired it, and were dreſt by us there,) I found this Patient with a heat all over his Body like an <hi>Eryſipelas:</hi> at which he was much affrighted. He had, it ſeems, drank Wine too liberally with his Mates, (as they would moſt of them doe, if they were any thing well.) Unleſs it rather proceeded from a generation of <hi>Callus,</hi>

                           <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> upon the generation of <hi>Callus.</hi>
                        </note> in which caſe it uſually happens. I let him bloud, and dreſſing him as in an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> finding his Arm pretty ſtrong, and his Wound healed within, and in a fair way of cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trizing, I raiſed him up, after he had lain about eight weeks. All which
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95669:223"/>while I believe he never ſtirred his Arm from the time I firſt placed it, but onely while I renewed the Dreſſings; he being the moſt patient man in that reſpect I ever attended: and in truth, without that Submiſſion he could ſcarce have been cured.</p>
                     <p>There was in this Patient a ſtrong <hi>Callus</hi> filling up the void place of the loſt Bone at leaſt two inches, with little or no ſhortning of the Arm: but the Joint of the Elbow was ſo ſtiff from the poſition it lay ſo long in, that he could not ſtretch that Joint whilſt I knew him, which was untill that Ship was caſt away.</p>
                     <p>My memory will be much cried up, for remembring ſo many Particulars in a Patient ſo many years ſince cured by me. But if you confider how remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable a caſe it was, and in my Trade, there will be leſs wondering at the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of it. You may enquire what was done by me in the Cure of Captain <hi>Reade,</hi> where the loſſe of his Jaw was ſupplied by a ſtrong <hi>Callus,</hi> and that Cheek made uniform with the other. It will be long remembred by the then Standers-by, though not of our Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>In our Sea-fights oftentimes a Buttock, the Brawn of the Thigh, the Calf of the Leg, are torn off by Chain-ſhot and Splinters. All theſe are contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wounds, and look black, and do too often deceive the unexperienced Chirurgeon, he taking them by their aſpect to be gangrened, and by dreſſing them as Mortifications with <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> and <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> doth certainly ſphacelate them; and thoſe perſons die miſerably afflicted.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if they be conſidered rightly, though they look like Fleſh long hang'd in the Air, of a dry blackiſh colour, yet they have warmth, and by Lenients, as is preſcribed in Simple Gun-ſhot Wounds, they would digeſt, ſeparate their Sloughs, and incarn. But they are flow in Digeſtion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good Fomentations and Embrocations to cheriſh the native heat, which is much weakened by ſo great a loſs of Subſtance. Theſe require <hi>oleum tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binth.</hi> to be mixt with your Digeſtive: but you muſt have a care you do not inflame them and cauſe pain by adding too much of it: a Spoonfull to ſix ounces of your Suppuratives is enough in the drieſt Habits. Your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will beſt direct you, and your Patient's complaint: it being unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hope that Wounds can digeſt, while they are accompanied with much Pain.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Gun-ſhot Wounds in the Joints.</head>
                     <p>THE Wounds of the Joints are ſubject to more grievous Accidents then thoſe I have heretofore mentioned;<note place="margin">Great care to be uſed about theſe Wounds, and why.</note> therefore they require your more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care; the Tendons and Ligaments being inſerted near the Joints for the motion thereof: there are alſo Membranes, which do conſequently render them of a moſt exquiſite ſenſe. The Trunk of Nerves alſo in every great Joint paſſeth through, for the uſe of the Member that is beyond it. To which I adde, that the Part being exſanguous, the naturall Balſam of the Body is here more ſparingly ſupplied for the help of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>What the Pains are, may be judged by the Wounds in the leſſer Joints. Captain F. in <hi>Muſſelborough</hi> Fight was ſhot in one of his Fingers, and the next day ſo grievouſly tormented, that he walkt up and down like a Mad-man, and could take no reſt untill his wounded Finger was digeſted: yet his Pain was not ſo great in his wounded as in his well Fingers.</p>
                     <p>The greater Wounds are attended with much more vehement Pain,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Delirium,</hi> Convulſions, Gangrene, and are commonly deadly.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Gun-ſhot Wounds,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> the extraneous bodies and Shivers of Bones muſt be preſently drawn forth: therefore if the Orifice be not large enough, make it ſo. But in enlarging the inner or lower Parts in the hollow of the Ham, Arm, Arm-pit or Groin, have a care, for they are ſubject to great Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The extraneous bodies being drawn forth, haſten Digeſtion, by drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and applying warm upon Doſſills or Pledgits ſome of theſe following Digeſtives: for Tents are to be uſed with caution in theſe Wounds.</p>

But in theſe great Wounds you are at firſt to conſider how cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are, and endeavour to preſerve the Life of your Patient by a timely Extirpation, before his Spirits be too much exhauſted.

The Bullet entred in by the lower and exteriour ſide of the <hi>Rotula,</hi> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Joint out in the hollow of the Ham, tare the Ligaments and Nerves, and fractured the Joint as it paſſed, rending the Artery in going out. This Wound was mortall the very minuit it was inflicted, and the party ought then to have been diſmembred: but ſuch Propoſalls were not admitted of in the firſt dreſſing, whilſt there was, as they judged, hope. Afterwards the vehement Pain brought ſuddenly on ſevere Accidents, as Fever, <hi>Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> &amp;c. and then it was too late to make Amputation. I made my firſt Dreſſing by the Application of a Digeſtive dipt <hi>in ol. lumbric.</hi> warm, and embrocated the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> applying my Reſtrictive over all. In the depending Orifice there was a throbbing of the Arteriall bloud, as in an <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> the bloud being choakt in by the contuſed Fleſh: it therefore was not there to be tented, for fear of making a Flux of bloud; nor yet could we hope to ſtop the Bleeding by Cautery, actuall or potentiall, that Part being full of Ligaments and Tendons, the burning whereof would have been difficult, and grievous painfull. Wherefore I dreſt that Wound with the ſame Digeſtive mixt with <hi>pulv. Galeni</hi> upon Doſſills with thick Pledgits, and ſome of the ſame Reſtrictive over that, with ſuch Bandage as that Part was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; hoping this way to hinder the Influx of Humour, and thinking by ſuch Dreſſings the Wound would digeſt. But the Pain increaſed vehemently, and yielded to no Application, nor was there any poſſibility of conveying any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, whereby I might thruſt or pull out the Shives of Bone, if any ſuch were in between the heads of the Joint. Mr. <hi>Penicuke,</hi> formerly Generall Chirurgeon to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army, and other Chirurgeons were with me at the dreſſing of this Patient: but in ſpight of all our Endeavours, the Putrefaction increaſed, and was attended by <hi>Delirium</hi> and Spaſm. Death followed, as commonly it doth in all ſuch Wounds of the great Joints. I could inſtance it in many, but the late caſe of Sr. <hi>J. L.</hi> may ſerve for all. He had many of our moſt experienced Chirurgeons, with the eminenteſt Phyſicians to help them; yet they had no better ſucceſs. Therefore at Sea, while they are warm with heat of Fight, we diſmember them, and by actuall Cautery ſtop the Flux of bloud.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Gun-ſhot Wounds in the Belly.</head>
                     <p>I Have now briefly run through the Parts not principall, and purpoſe next to ſay ſomewhat of the principall Parts, as the Belly and Breaſt. And that you may the more certainly know the Part wounded, I ſhall give you a ſhort Deſcription of them, and then ſhew you how ſuch Wounds are to be handled in order to their Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Belly is called <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or the inferiour <hi>Venter.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Abdomen</hi> deſcribed.</note> It begins from the Baſtard-ribs, and extends it ſelf to the Goins; and is divided into three Regions by our Anatomiſts, the upper, middle, and lowermoſt. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is called <hi>Epigaſtrium,</hi> the middle <hi>Regio umbilicalis,</hi> the inferiour <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrium.</hi> The ſides of the uppermoſt are termed <hi>Hypochondria.</hi> The right <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> poſſeſſeth all the Liver: in the left is the Spleen. Between theſe is placed the <hi>Ventriculus,</hi> or Stomach. In the middle part of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> is the Navell; round about which lie the Guts, and behind thoſe on each ſide the Kidneys. In the ſides of the inferiour part are the <hi>Ilia,</hi> with the <hi>Pecten</hi> or <hi>Pubes</hi> in the middle: under which lies the Bladder. Thus much to the internall Delineation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Abdomen</hi> conſiſts moreover of Parts containing, and contained. Parts containing, or Teguments of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> are either the common, which reach all over the Body, as the <hi>Cuticula, Cutis, Pinguedo, Membrana carnoſa:</hi> or the particular and proper to this place, which are the Muſcles of the Belly, the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and in reſpect of the Guts the <hi>Omentum.</hi> The Parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are ſome of them deſigned for the Nutrition of the whole Body, others for Expurgation, and others for Generation. The Stomack, Small inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, <hi>Meſenterium, Vena porta, cava, Arteria magna,</hi> and <hi>coeliaca magna,</hi> the Liver and Spleen, ſerve for Nutrition. The Bladder, Gall, all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, but eſpecially the great ones, Kidneys all Ureters, for Expurgation. And for Procreation, the <hi>Vaſsa praeparantia &amp; deferentia, Proſtatae,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus</hi> in Women. Theſe Parts containing and contained are ſubject to Gun-ſhot; whence various Species ariſe of theſe Wounds. Sometimes the containing Parts,<note place="margin">Wounds not penetrating.</note> as the <hi>Cutis, Pinguedo, Caro muſculoſa,</hi> onely are wounded; ſo as neither the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> nor the other internall Parts ſuffer any hurt.</p>
                     <p>And this hath happened to many in Service, who have been brought to me as mortally wounded, whereas upon ſearch I have found the impreſſion onely upon a greazy Leather Jerkin, or their Bellies black and a little ſcratcht by the Bullet. Yet even theſe are ſubject to Tumor, and ſo do require lenient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocations, with an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> or the like. In others the Skin, and Fleſh under it, is ſometimes wounded, and no farther. Theſe are by us called Wounds of the Belly not penetrating, and are cured as Gun-ſhot Wounds in Fleſhy parts: in which caſes all thoſe Applications are approved of which have been delivered in Simple Gun-ſhot Wounds.</p>
                     <p>But this I muſt take notice of to you, as having often obſerved it, not onely in Gun-ſhot Wounds, but in Abſceſſes of the Belly, that from the Laxity of
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95669:225"/>the Parts, they are ſubject to great Defluxion: eſpecially in Scorbuticall and ill Habits of body, the Matter is apt to inſinuate it ſelf amongſt the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Muſcles, raiſing them up, and rendring them Sinuous Ulcers difficult of Cure; and that becauſe we cannot make ſuch Bandage on them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Figure, Site and perpetuall Motion, as elſewhere may be made. Theſe thus briefly conſidered,<note place="margin">Wounds pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating.</note> we paſs to the other Species: for the Bullet is for the moſt part carried with ſuch force, that it not onely wounds the Fleſhy parts, but alſo pierces the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> hurting moſt an end the Internalls; it being indeed impoſſible that the Bullet piercing the Parts containing ſhould miſs the contained, which are ſoft and tender.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen ſometimes in the Wars a Souldier ſhot ſcarce to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> yet the Contuſion hath been ſo great, that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> hath come off upon Digeſtion: in which caſe the Bowells commonly ſuffer under ſevere Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and there ariſeth Difficulty of breathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Bullet penetrates through the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> though no farther, yet the Contuſion makes foul work, and requires ſpeedy relief. But if it hath wounded the internall <hi>Viſcera,</hi> then you muſt conſider what the Parts are that are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether the Liver, Stomach, or which of the Inteſtines; which you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from the Site of the Part, and the Accidents accompanying ſuch Wounds, alſo by the proper Symptoms of each Part.</p>
                     <p>According to <hi>Celſus, Lib.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs of wounds of the internall parts of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                        </note> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. the Liver being hurt, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Effuſion of groſs bloud: if the <hi>Porta</hi> or <hi>Vena cava</hi> be hurt, the right <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> is oppreſt: if the Artery be wounded, the bloud is florid, and burſts impetuouſly forth, and the Patient expires with it. But if the Stomach be hurt, <hi>Singultus</hi> or Hiccough follows, with Vomiting and <hi>Nauſea,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Suſtenance comes out of his Wound with the Chyle, and cold Sweats ſhew his languiſhing condition. If the leſſer Inteſtines be wounded, he will be troubled with poraceous Vomiting, and what he eats or drinks will paſs out of his Wound in leſs then half an hour; and ſo it will continue to do as long as he lives. If the great Inteſtines be wounded, the Excrements and filthy Smell will demonſtrate it. If the Wound be on the left <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> under the Short ribs, you may conclude the Spleen wounded; the bloud which floweth forth is black; there is alſo a Tenſion, and Difficulty of breath. If the Kidney be hurt, the Wound is in the Region of the Loyns, near the <hi>Vertebra</hi> under the <hi>Diaphragma.</hi> The more certain ſign thereof is from the Pains reaching to the Groins and Teſticles, with difficulty of Urine: and that Urine which he voids is either mixt with Bloud, or elſe pure Bloud. If the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be wounded, the Urine comes out at the Wound. If the Bladder be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that part of the Belly is tenſe, he hath great pain in his Groin, and his Urine is diſcharged by the Wound; the Stomach ſuffers by conſent, and the Part wounded demonſtrates it. If the Womb be wounded, the Groins and <hi>Coxa</hi> are afflicted with the Pain, and the bloud not onely flows by the Wound, but <hi>per Vulvam;</hi> they are troubled in Mind, and have other ſhrewd Symptoms of Death.</p>
                     <p>For what concerns the Preſage of theſe Gun-ſhot Wounds,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> if they be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Region of the Belly, they are not without perill, eſpecially if in the middle, where the <hi>Linea alba</hi> is: but if they penetrate, there is great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, for theſe Parts ſo ſhattered ſeldome recover. What we have ſometimes ſince ſeen, of a man diſcharging his Excrements out of the <hi>Colon</hi> on the left Side, and heard of other like Wounds of the Stomach, are rather Miracles then the work of the Chirurgeon. But they were happy that were inſtrumentall in thoſe Cures. If <hi>Celſus</hi> in his time determined thoſe Wounds mortall made by cutting Weapons; how much more muſt they be ſuch that are made in our age by <hi>Gun-ſhot?</hi> Yet Nature, as one ſaith in his <hi>Vulneribus, ſaepe miracula
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:95669:225"/>facere ſolet,</hi> is often as mercifull and miraculous in the Cure, as the Blow was cruel.</p>
                     <p>In order to the <hi>Cure,</hi> you muſt begin with the Extraction of the Bullet,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> leſt it ſink into the moſt inward Parts, and there afflict the <hi>Viſcera;</hi> as alſ of the Rags carried in with it, leſt they beget Putrefaction. That done, you muſt reduce the Inteſtines and <hi>Omentum,</hi> leſt they inflate and corrupt. After the Extraction of the extraneous bodies, you muſt haſten Digeſtion, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>The Inteſtines and <hi>Omentum</hi> are diſpoſed to Reduction by warm diſcuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fomentations: but if there be not an Opening wide enough, you muſt enlarge the Wound. If the <hi>Omentum</hi> be corrupted, make a Ligature below that corrupt part, and cut if off, leaving the end of the Ligature hanguing out, till it ſhall be caſt off by Digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>If there be <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> you muſt inject ſuch Medicaments as have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerant and aſtringent quality: and thoſe may be, <hi>aq. urtic. plantag. ſpermat. ranar.</hi> or Red wine, <hi>cum ſyr. de roſ. ſicc.</hi> with <hi>Pulv. bol.

                        <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath recommended to our uſe this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the uſe whereof he cured Wounds of the Stomach and Inteſtines. ℞ <hi>fol. piloſellae, plantag. rad. tormentill. conſolid. maj. flor. hyperici:</hi> decoct theſe in Red wine; ſtrain it out, and adde to the ſaid Liquour <hi>mannae, thuris, ol. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich. reſin. abiet. terebinth.

                     <p>In all theſe Wounds of the Belly I have uſed ſuch like Medicaments as I have offered unto you, and applied to the Wound it ſelf Digeſtives, as in Simple Gun-ſhot, and endeavoured by good Fomentations, Embrocations and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms, to preſerve the naturall warmth of the Part.</p>
                     <p>In Wounds of the Kidneys,<note place="margin">Wounds of the Kidneys.</note> you muſt inject ſuch Medicaments as have an abſterſive and drying quality; as <hi>rad. conſolid. irid. ariſtoloch. rot.</hi> alſo <hi>myrtill. caud. equin. plantag. balauſt.</hi> Decoct theſe in <hi>aq. chalybeat.</hi> adding afterwards ſome Red wine and <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſicc.</hi> thereto. Then dreſs up the Wound with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive <hi>ex terebinth. cum integr. ovo,</hi> with a little <hi>terra ſigill. thus</hi> and Maſtich, and embrocate with <hi>ol. hyperici;</hi> applying <hi>empl. diachalcith.</hi> malaxt with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> or a Cataplaſm <hi>ex far. hord. fabar. &amp; orobi</hi> decocted in Oxymel, and made up with a new-laid Egg and <hi>ol. roſ.</hi>

                     <p>If the Liver or Spleen be wounded,<note place="margin">Wounds of the Liver, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> there will be a great Flux of bloud; in which caſe I offer this to you: ℞ <hi>plantag. pentaphyll. polygon. millefol. myrtill. roſ. rubr.</hi> decoct theſe in chalybeat Water.

                     <p>Thus you are to dreſs all the Wounds in the particular Parts of the Belly.</p>
                     <p>The Wounds of the Womb are accounted deadly, the very leaſt of them, and ſo are all the aboveſaid made by Gun-ſhot; yet you are to proceed in the univerfall Regiment, and with Clyſters, Bleeding, and good Vulneraries, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to diſpoſe the Parts to Sanity.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Gun-ſhot Wounds in the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AMongſt the principall Parts which are ſubject to Gun-ſhot, the middle <hi>Venter</hi> or <hi>Thorax</hi> is reconed, with the Parts contained in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart, Lungs, great Artery and Veſſells, with the <hi>Mediaſtinum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Wounds are diſtinguiſhed as thoſe of the inferiour <hi>Venter.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Difference.</note> Sometimes the Wounds are onely of the externall parts, without penetrating into the Breaſt; othertimes they penetrate through the Ribs and <hi>Pleura:</hi> in which latter caſe the principall <hi>Viſcera</hi> are wounded, or not wounded.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound do not penetrate into the Cavity of the Breaſt, but is onely in the Muſculous fleſh,<note place="margin">Not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> it muſt be cured as Wounds in the Fleſhy parts. If there be a Fracture with it, it muſt be treated as a Wound with Fracture, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care to extract the broken Bones, leſt they prick the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and cauſe Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bullet hath penetrated deep into the Cavity, it may be diſcerned by the paſſing forth of the air with noiſe:<note place="margin">Penetrating. Signs.</note> there will alſo follow a Flux of bloud by the Wound, or Mouth, or by both; unleſs the bloud fall down upon the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> and then the Difficulty of breathing and ſuch like Symptoms will demonſtrate its Penetration. And if the Lungs be wounded, there will be a Cough, with Difficulty of breathing, and frequent Sighing: if there be an effuſion of bloud, it will, accordingly as it is much or little, flow forth of the Wound, or be cought up, ſometimes both: the Patient will incline to lie much upon the Wound. If the Heart be hurt, the bloud floweth impetuouſly, and is reeking hot, their Spirits ſink, and cold Sweats bedewing their Face fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew their approaching Death.</p>
                     <p>The wounded <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is accompanied with Difficulty of breathing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a a Hoarſneſs, with great Pain about the falſe Ribs; the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is drawn upward, and the Spine is affected.</p>
                     <p>If the great Vein or Artery be hurt, a terrible Flux of bloud follows. If it flow from the right Side, the <hi>Cava</hi> is hurt; but if from the left Side, we ſuppoſe it the Artery. You will diſcover it by its Saltation and florid colour. If the <hi>Porta</hi> be wounded, the Patient dies at the inſtant; and ſo he doth of all the reſt. If the <hi>Spinalis medulla</hi> be wounded, the Nerves are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and a Palſie follows, but more immediately in the Part under the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all theſe Wounds made by Gun-ſhot are mortall; but it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Religion or Humanity, to leave ſuch people without help: for ſometimes we haply prolong the life of ſome of them, and now and then cure one.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore proceed to deliver you what concerns their <hi>Cure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> both as to the internall Remedies given by the Mouth, and to thoſe which relate exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to the Wounds.</p>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:95669:226"/>
                     <p>In the firſt place, you muſt make Extraction of the Bullets and other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous bodies, Shivers of Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to give way for the diſcharge of Bloud and Matter contained in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax:</hi> then dreſs the Wound with a Tent dipt in this or ſuch like; ℞ <hi>bol. Armen. corn. cerv. uſt. ol. roſ. &amp; ſambuc, farin. volatil. cum ovo integr. Miſc.</hi> Spred a Compreſſe with ſome of the ſame, and apply it over the Wound. If the bloud ſtop not by this Dreſſing let bloud in the Arm, and repeat it as often as you ſee cauſe, applying ſome of the Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents ſet down in the preceding Chapters. Or you may inject ſome aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Decoctions, which is otherwiſe then was adviſed in Wounds made by Puncture: for in Gun-ſhot Wounds the Orifice is wide enough for the Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to return out again, inſomuch that not onely the aſtrictive Intentions ought to be purſued, but alſo the deterſive; here being loſs of Subſtance. Therefore in caſe of Bleeding you may inject a Decoction of <hi>fol. plantag. ulmi. urticae, vincae pervincae, roſ. rubr. fol. myrtill. in aq. germ. querc.</hi> adding a little <hi>bol. Armen.</hi> and <hi>ſyr. de ſymphyt.</hi> Or for preſent occaſion uſe Red wine, it being excellently good in ſuch bleeding Wounds, either given inwardly by the Mouth, or caſt in by a Syringe. Having thus ſtopt the bloud, you are to digeſt the Wound with ſuch like: ℞ <hi>terebinth. lot. in decoct. hord.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>pulv. thuris, myrrhae, an.</hi> ℈ij. <hi>ſem. foenugr. pulv.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>ol. hyperici q. ſ.</hi> Arm ſhort Tents with ſome of it; then apply over it a Pledgit with ſome of the ſame, or with ſuch Suppuratives as in Simple Gun-ſhot Wounds are preſcribed, and embrocate the Breaſt and Parts about with a Mixtrue of <hi>ol. amygdal. dulc. lumbric.</hi> and <hi>unguent. dialthaeae,</hi> apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all an <hi>empl. diachyl. ſimpl.</hi> malaxed in ſome of the ſame. After Digeſtion you will find it neceſſary to deterge and incarn. It is not materiall whether the Deterſion be made by Injection or Unguent, there may be uſe for both; to which purpoſe I have ſet you down both ſorts, and ſhall begin with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as ſuppoſing the Matter may thereby be diſpoſed to diſcharge by the Wound. The milder may be a Decoction of <hi>piloſella</hi> with <hi>mel roſ.</hi> If ſtronger be needed, ℞ <hi>extract. ſcord.</hi> diſſolved <hi>in vino albo;</hi> or, ℞ <hi>fol. piloſellae caud. equin. plantag. tormentill, conſolid. ariſtoloch. rot. rad. iridis, &amp; ſarcocoll.</hi> boil theſe in <hi>aq. font.</hi> adding Wine thereto with <hi>mel roſ. q. ſ.</hi> The Unguent may be this following Mundificative: ℞ <hi>terebinth.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>farin. hord. cribrat.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>thuris, ſarcocoll. rad. iridis, an.</hi>

The Wound deterged, incarn and cicatrize as is ſaid in other Wounds; but keep a <hi>Cannula</hi> in it untill it ceaſe to run. <hi>Celſus</hi> propoſes, that in all theſe internall Wounds the externall Parts be veſicated, to make more powerfull Revulſion from; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and the Medicament he propoſes thereto is <hi>Sal bene contritus cum ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato mixtus, quia leviter cutim erodit, eóque impetum materiae quo pulmo vexatur evocat.</hi> This his Propoſal may be proper in Wounds made by ſharp Weapons, as by Arrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here in theſe Wounds there is vexaction enough out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to make a Revulſion, if that ſignified any thing. In the dreſſing theſe you muſt be carefull to cut off the Sloughs without, leſt from them a ſtinking Gleet diſtill upon the <hi>Viſcera</hi> within. In order to the Cure, Clyſters are alſo required, to keep the Body open: and the more temperate Pectorall Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are here proper, ſuch as that in the <hi>London Diſpenſatory.</hi> To them may be added <hi>ſyr. violar. de cichor. de liquiritia, jujub. capill. ven. de ſymphyto,</hi> and ſuch Lohochs as may take off the harſhneſs in the <hi>Aſpera arteria.</hi> Their Diet ought to be ſlender, and their Drink: medicated Ale or <hi>Hydromel</hi> wherein Pectorals have been decocted are proper in all theſe Wounds; ſo are alſo Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and after the Fever and ſuch like Accidents are diminiſed, Aſſes and Goats milk may be neceſſary; yea a Diet of Cows milk alone, or mixed with diſtilled Milks, and ſweetned with Conſerve of Roſes. But this will be
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:95669:227"/>work for the Phyſician, when they come aſhoar. Many Inſtances may be given of Gun-ſhot in the Breaſt: but few do recover that are ſhot into the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>At the Battel of <hi>Worceſter</hi> there was one brought to us ſhot with a Musket-bullet through one ſide of the <hi>Sternon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> which paſſed out between two of the Ribs on the other ſide, without any viſible Symptom of danger. We dreſſed the Wounds with a Digeſtive dipt in <hi>ol. lumbric.</hi> warm, and kept the lower Orifice between the Ribs open for diſcharge of the Matter, it being the depending Orifice. He was let bloud, and preſcribed Pectoralls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occaſion offered. His Wound digeſted, and was afterwards deterged with <hi>mel roſar.</hi> &amp;c. After our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat he was dreſſed by <hi>Will. Clarke,</hi> now of <hi>Bridgenorth;</hi> and, as I have been ſince informed by him, was concealed by ſome Houſekeeper until he made his eſcape.</p>
                     <p>From the Defeat of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army near <hi>Dunbar</hi> there came many of the wounded to <hi>Saint-Johnſtons,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> and amongſt them there were ſeverall wounded into the Breaſt. They who were ſo ſhot as to have the Ribs broken, were in extreme Pain from the Shivers; whereas the reſt whoſe Bones were not hurt had ſcarce any Pain at all, but what proceeded from Difficulty of breathing; they all coughing up a ſtinking <hi>Sanies</hi> both before and after the ſeparation of the Sloughs. One of them cought a very great proportion daily of thin Matter, of a brown colour and ranck ſmell. None but this died under my hands; the reſt after ſome while retiring to their homes, where (as I have often heard them ſay) their Leeches performed great Cures, by virtue of ſome Plants which they gave internally, and which with Fats they made Balſams of. Yet I believe this man died tabid.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Symptoms of Gun-ſhot, (omitted in the Fourth Chapter.)</head>
                     <p>THE Symptoms attending Gun-ſhot are Pain, <hi>Phlegmon, Eryſipelas,</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Delirium, Syncope,</hi> Gangrene, Convulſion, and Palſie. The Pain occaſions Inflammation, whether it be <hi>Phlegmon</hi> or <hi>Eryſipelas;</hi> of both which I have elſewhere purpoſely treated. But that of Gangrene I thought fit ſhould accompany Gun-ſhot, they of all Wounds being moſt ſubject to it. The Fever it ſymptomatical, ſo is the <hi>Delirium,</hi> and will go off with the Pain; but may, with the forementioned Inflammations, be relieved by Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and lenient Purgatives, ſuch as I have mentioned. And to fortifie the Spirits againſt Fainting, which proceeds from putrid Vapours affecting the Heart, there are Cordialls and <hi>Epithemata</hi> already preſcribed. So that there remains onely Convulſion and Palſie to be here treated of.</p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:95669:227"/>
                     <p>Convulſion is, An involuntary Contraction of the Nerves to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,<note place="margin">Convulſion.</note> by which Contraction the Member is alſo drawn up; and it is ſaid to be cauſed by Repletion and Inanition. In this our caſe it ariſeth from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Vapours, or acrid Matter offending the Nerves, which is often found in theſe Wounds. The Part affected is the Brain, which being thus provoked cauſeth an involuntary Contraction and Rigidity in Parts diſmembred, as near the Knee or Shoulder. There the Contraction cannot be diſcerned but by a Trembling, which Trembling is uſually attended by a Convulſion of the Joints. It likewiſe follows upon great Inflammation, eſpecially in the Nervous parts. The Prognoſtick here is always fatall, a Convulſion upon a Wound being he forerunner of death.</p>
                     <p>In the Wars I was called to ſee a poor Souldier,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> who had his Arm ſhot off near the Shoulder. The bruiſed and ſhattered Stump ſeemed to his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon to be gangrened, and accordingly he dreſt him with <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> as a Gangrene: from which ſharp Dreſſings the Wound gleeted, and, by reaſon of the Pain, inflamed. He had roared ſome days through the vehemency of that Pain. When I came to him, I ſaw a great Trembling of the Part, and a frequent twitching upwards of the Tendons and Muſculous fleſh in the Stump; alſo the Fleſh in the whole Stump was of a whitiſh colour, as if it had been ſcalded. I dreſt him up with Anodynes, as <hi>Liniment. Arcei cum vitell. ovi,</hi> and fomented the Part with <hi>fol. malvar. violar. thapſ. barbat.</hi> decocted in Milk, embrocating it <hi>cum ol. lumbric. &amp; ex ped. bovinis,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. diapalmae cum ſuccis</hi> over all; then anointed the Parts about, as the Neck and Spine, with <hi>unguent. nervin.</hi> I alſo bliſtered the Legs and Thighs: but it was too late, he died howling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paralyſis</hi> is generally defined, A privation of ſenſe or motion, or both,<note place="margin">Palſie.</note> in ſome Part or Parts, and affects the Brain and <hi>Spinalis medulla.</hi> But in Palſies which ariſe from Wounds the Parts immediately affected are the Nerves of that place onely. This doth not take away the life of the Patient, though it may ſometimes threaten a Mortification through defect of naturall heat in the Member.</p>
                     <p>In a Sea-fight an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mariner having diſcharged his Gun,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> which was hony-combed, and loading it ſuddenly again, whilſt he was ramming in a Cartridge, the Powder took fire, and ſhot the Rammer out of his hand, tearing the Palm of his hand, alſo ſome of his Thumb and Fingers. The Wound was not conſiderable, but the force of the Blow extinguiſhed both ſenſe and motion of the Member. I dreſt him up with our common Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, (of which at ſuch times we had great quantity ready,) and applied over all a common Reſtrictive, ſo rowled it up, there being then no time for Bleeding him. But after the Fight I let him bloud, and a day or two after purged him, then fomented and embrocated the Member with <hi>ol. lumbric. cham. anethi, lilior. unguent. nervin.</hi> and ſuch like, and did all that we Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons of the Squadron thought fitting; but without ſucceſs. One night after he was cured of his Wound, lying aſleep in his Hammock, he was wakened by the wet he felt upon his Breaſt and Belly; and getting up to a Candle, he found the Dreſſing upon his Hand all bloudy, as alſo the place whereon it lay. I being called took off his greazy Dreſſings, and found the Palm of his hand and Fingers gnawed by Rats. They had eaten through the oiled Cloaths, and had gnawed his Hand more, if he had not wakened by the trickling of his bloud. I dreſt his Wounds with Digeſtives to haſten Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, ſuppoſing the diſcharge of Matter might contribute to his Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. After I had cured them, I made him a Fontanell in that Arm, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Member frequently, alſo cupped and ſcarified it; and afterwards
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:95669:228"/>applied Plaiſters of Pitch, to ſtir up a heat in the Member. He was a young man, and otherwiſe of a ſtrong Conſtitution, and was not over-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to have it cured, as deſigning to make ſome profit by it. To which purpoſe he took an opportunity of landing, and haſtened away to <hi>Madrid:</hi> where having gotten ſome reward for his ſervice, he returned to the Navy, and had more uſe of his Arm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paralyſis</hi> doth often happen in great Contuſions and Luxations; of which more elſewhere.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus finiſhed the <hi>Treatiſes of Wounds,</hi> I conſidered with my ſelf that my Deſign was to help the Sea-Chirurgeous, who ſeldome trouble thier Cabbins with many Books. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it convenient to make this as comprehenſive for their uſe as I could, by compriſing in it all thoſe things which may eaſily be foreſeen to be of uſe to them in other caſes beſides Wounds. We know by our experience, that Burnings by Gun-powder and other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls do too frequently happen at Sea; and alſo, by ill Dreſſings of Wounds, Gangrenes and <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> ariſe, and that much the ſooner, if broken Bones, eſpecially thoſe with Wounds, be not well brought together, and ſo held. All which matter we occaſionally handled in the foregoing Work: yet not ſo much, but that, for their farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, I thought it requiſite to anticipate ſomething of other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes which I intend for the Preſs, by the following <hi>Appendix;</hi> which, if well peruſed, may perfect the Chirurgeon in what remains to be known concerning Wounds, and ſave him the labour of reading many Authours.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I. De Ambuſtis,</hi> or, Of Burns with Gun-powder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as it often happens, that in cloſe Fights at Sea men are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burnt by Gun-powder by thier Enemies, and by various Accidents amongſt themſelves; I ſhall therefore deliver to you the moſt plain way of curing them. For, however people cry, It's nothing to cure a Burn: yet, by what I have ſeen of theſe Cures from Country or City, they are often very ill performed. Whether they are burnt by Gun-powder or any other way, their Cure is much alike, they onely differing <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus.</hi> Onely if they be burnt with Gun-powder, they muſt pick out the Powder firſt; elſe they will carry the ſame blew Mark, if it be in their Faces, which ſome people uſe to do in their Hands and Arms, which I have often been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to take out, when done wantonly in their youth; but could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them otherwiſe then by taking off the Skin.</p>
                     <p>If the Burn be ſuperficiall, it raiſeth the <hi>Cuticula</hi> up in Bliſters: if it goe deeper into the Skin, it cauſes an Eſcar: if it burn deeper into the Fleſh, the force of the fire makes a hard Cruſt with a Contraction. In all theſe the Pain is exceſſive.</p>
                     <p>Once as I was dreſſing a gangrened Leg with warm Spirits of <hi>terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> Chirurgeons and others being cloſe about me, and I upon my Knees, the Candle being too near the hot Spirits, catcht the flame, and burnt my Thumb and Fingers before I could get free from thoſe behind me to throw it into the Chimney, which was ſome diſtance off. I felt much more Pain for the while in the ſuperficiall Scalding, then where it was burnt to an Eſcar.</p>
                     <p>The Indications of <hi>Cure</hi> are of two kinds: <hi>viz.</hi> either by Refrigerants to bath or anoint the Part,<note place="margin">Cure of a Burn.</note> untill the Heat be off, and the Eſcar ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then to digeſt and cicatrize; or by calefactive Medicaments to relax the Skin, and reſolve and diſſipate it, which by accident will aſſwage the heat and Burning.<note place="margin">Refrigerants.</note> The Refrigerants are, <hi>aq. ſolani, plantag. hyoſcyam. lac ebuty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum;</hi> and all the cooling Juices and Unguents, as <hi>unguent. album, nutritum, populneum, rofat.</hi> &amp;c. Theſe muſt be uſed warm, untill the Heat and Pain ceaſe, or the Fire be taken out, (as the common expreſſion is;) elſe they will rather cauſe Pain.<note place="margin">Calefactives.</note> Hot Medicaments aſſwage the fiery Heat and Pain by Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Which in the firſt place may be done by the holding a burning hot Iron or Fire to the Part: ſo whilſt the Fire calls forth that Fire it made, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes its <hi>Alexiterium.</hi> But the common remedy is, to apply Salt and an Onion beaten together. But this is not to be done after the Bliſters are riſen, nor by any means where the Part is raw; for ſo you will exaſperate the Pain, and increaſe the Inflammation. There are many other things do extinguiſh the Fire. <hi>Fimus equinus</hi> doth it, fried <hi>in ol. nucum, uvae immaturae, ſambucus,</hi> and <hi>ebulus in oleo coct. calx viva extinct. &amp; cum unguent. roſaceo mixta ad conſiſt.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95669:229"/>unguenti.</hi> Theſe are to be renewed often, untill the Pain and Heat be off, which they in few days effect. If theſe Applications do not prevent the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Veſiculae,</hi> you muſt cut them as they ariſe, leſt by their eroſion they make hollow Ulcers, and inflame with ſharp Pains, Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But where they are burnt to a Cruſt or Eſcar, you muſt haſten its fall with Emollients, then digeſt, incarn, and cicatrize.</p>
                     <p>Here is required Bleeding and Evacuation by Lenients: but if there be <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> you muſt purge more powerfully. A ſpare Diet is requiſite,<note place="margin">Regiment in Burns.</note> with all otehr Regulation proportionably according as the Burn is greater or leſs. I ſhall give you for your farther information two remarkable Inſtances of Burns: the firſt in the Wars, occaſioned by Accident thus.</p>
                     <p>A Souldier in the time of ſervice being in the Fort-Royall at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of burning with Gun-powder.</note> haſtily fetched his Bonnet full of Gun-powder; and whilſt he was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Bandeliers, another Souldier careleſly beſtrides it, to make a Shot at one of the Enemies which he ſaw lying <hi>perdue.</hi> In firing his Musket, a ſpark flew out of the Pan, and gave fire to the Powder underneath him, and grievouſly burned the Hands, Arms, Breaſt, Neck and Face of him that was filling his Bandeliers. And as to himſelf, he likewiſe was burned and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in all the upper part of his Thighs, <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and the Coats of the Teſticles to the <hi>Erythroïdes,</hi> ſo that the Cremaſters were viſible. And indeed it was to be feared, that, when the Eſcar ſhould caſt off from his Belly, his Bowells would have tumbled out. We dreſſed the ſeverall Parts of them both with <hi>mel ſaponis,</hi> and embrocated the Parts about <hi>cum ol. roſ. &amp; albumine ovor.</hi> beat together, and let them bloud. I did not ſee the iſſue: but <hi>Will. Clarke,</hi> who was then one of my Servants, and aſſiſted me in the dreſſing them, ſtaid there, and attended their Cure, after the Defeat of our Army. And he lately told me, he cured the latter of theſe with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. and the former made his Eſcape out of Town.</p>
                     <p>A young Gentleman of aoubt ten years of age,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Burn with Gun-powder.</note> boarded it a School a few miles off, the Evening before the fifth of <hi>November</hi> having filled his right Pocket full of Squibs and Crackers, threw one of them into the Chimney amongſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. It took fire: but whether it ſcattered the Fire, and ſome ſpark of that flew into his Pocket, or whether it was the Cracker, but thoſe in his Pocket took fire alſo, and his Cloaths burnt. At the ſight whereof his little Chamber-fellow ran out for help. In his abſence a little Boy from ſome other Apartment took the alarm, came in, and ſeeing his School-fellow in a flame, catched up a Baſon of water, and threw it upon him; then ran away for help. Others came in and reſcued him out of his burnt Cloaths. A neighbouring Chirurgeon was ſent for who dreſſed him. The next day they brought the Patient to Town. I found him burnt into the Fleſh from a hand's breadth below that Arm-pit down that Side, with part of his Belly, and from thence it ſpred down to the <hi>Os ileon</hi> and <hi>Gluteus,</hi> and along the Thigh almoſt to the Knee. And by endeavouring to free his Pockets of the Crackers, he alſo burnt his Hand from the Fingers ends along the inſide of his Arm to his Elbow-joynt. The Parts which were burnt to an Eſcar I anointed with <hi>mel eum ſucco cepar. &amp; pulv. iridis</hi> mixt, and fomented the Parts about with a Decoction of <hi>hyoſcyam. malvar. ſolan. violar. ſem. cydon. pſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Gangrene and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe moſt cruell Symptoms that attend Gun-ſhot and great contuſed Wounds are <hi>Gangraena</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gangrene is a tendency to Mortification: it invades the ſofter Parts,<note place="margin">Definition.</note> as the Skin, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is the beginning of a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is a perfect Mortification, with the extinction of the native Heat and privation of Senſe, not onely in the Skin, Fleſh, Nerve, Artery, but the very Bones.</p>
                     <p>They differ from one another, as the Mortification is more or leſs.<note place="margin">Difference, Cauſes.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Gangrene are various, <hi>viz.</hi> whatſoever deſtroyeth the naturall Heat: as Interception of the motion of the bloud by over-ſtrict Bandage in Wounds and Amputations, want of timely extracting of extraneous bodies in Gun-ſhot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence Pain and Fluxion do ariſe; ſo exceſſe of Cold in hard Winters, alſo in Old age, and the like. A Gangrene doth ariſe alſo in Phlegmons, through the unſeaſonable application of over-cold Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or for want of timely Digeſtion; or by exceſſe of Heat, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh cauſticall, as we find in Carbuncles and all Eſcars. But that which moſt of all contributes to it is the Degeneration of Humours in unſound Bodies: in ſome of which not onely all great Operations, but even the application of a Cauſtick, cutting a Corn, or pairing a Nail of a Toe to the quick, will endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Mortification. Some I have ſeen (you may call them Scorbuticall perſons if you pleaſe) who upon the appearance onely of a ſmall black Spot on the Foot without Tumour, have ſuffered a very quick unavoidable Mortification. But I would not have you therefore conclude every Scorbuticall Spot a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene: for this latter lies dry in the Skin without either Inflammation or Pain.</p>
                     <p>In one of the aboveſaid caſes, where the Gangrene was ſtopped by the ſpeedy aſſiſtence of Art, an Apoplexy followed in few days after: of which more anon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of a Gangrene are, change of the naturall colour in the Skin to a pale livid, with diminution of Tumour; Bliſters alſo ariſe,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and the Part turneth black ſoon after. In Wounds, the Lips ſink and are flaccid; a Gleet followeth, and the Fleſh within withers; alſo the Pulſe and Senſe in the Part do both languiſh.</p>
                     <p>A perſon having been ſhot in the Arm, and the Wound undigeſted,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> I being conſulted adviſed the laying open of the Wound, and extraction of the Bullet, Rags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but was over-ruled by others, and it was deferred to farther conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Two days after I viſited the Patient, and asked the Chirurgeon whether he had laid open the Wound. He replied, there was no need, for he could turn his finger in it, and pull out the Bullet and Rags, if it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarry. As I was going out of the houſe, I met the Phyſician, who inquiring of me the Patient's health, I replied that the Chirurgeon had unwittingly given me the certain ſign of his Death. For <hi>in magnis vulneribus &amp; pravis, fi Tumores non appareant, ingens malum.</hi> That was a great Wound, and not
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:95669:231"/>being digeſted, ſhould have been accompanied with Fluxion and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Lips ſhould have been full, the Orifice contracted: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Heat was decayed, the Lips were lank without ſenſe, and at that time Sphacelated. A day or two after he died, too certainly juſtifying my Prognoſtick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from a Gangrene by the totall Corruption and Stink, it being alſo inſenſible both of Knife and Fire. If a Gangrene proceed from Pain, the Tumour and preceding Inflammation will ſhew it, and the ſudden ſinking of that Tumour is the beginning of the Gangrene. If the Gangrene be from Cold, the Part is firſt benummed, then accompanied with a pricking Pain, alſo a Redneſſe, which by degrees turneth black, and a Horrour and Rigour ſeizeth upon the Patient. If it be from Interception of the Spirits by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of over-ſtrict Bandage, there is neither Fluxion nor Pain, but a Flaccidity joyned with an Inſenſibility in the Part. If it be from Old age, the Patient is lean, nature viſibly decayed, his Legs and other extremities are firſt ſeized, and the Part is moſt commonly without Tumour.</p>
                     <p>All Gangrenes are dangerous,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> as threatening the Life of the Patient they affect. Thoſe that begin in the externall Parts by reaſon of Inflammation are of leaſt danger, if the Habit of body be tolerably good, and the Mortification timely treated. Thoſe that ariſe deep within the Wound from Gun-ſhot or fractured Bones are extremely hazzardous, eſpecially if they be in or near the Joynts, though the Habit of body be good.</p>
                     <p>Gangrenes ariſing from Parts abounding with too much Humidity are in great danger, for thereby the naturall Heat is ſoon overcome: for which reaſon Grangrenes in very fat and Hydropicall bodies, eſpecially in the latter, are rarely extinguiſhed. So alſo thoſe ariſing from an internall cauſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more dangerous then thoſe that ariſe from an accidentall. Yet in all theſe there are ſome hopes of Cure. But in <hi>Sphacelus</hi> there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſave onely by a ſpeedy ſeparation of the ſphacelated Part: for if any of it remain, it ſoon creepeth up by the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and infecteth the whole Member, and is accompanied with Watching, Raving, frequent Faintings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Hiccough, and cold Sweats; which foreſhew the Patient's approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Death in the Treatiſe of <hi>Tumours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cure</hi> of Gangrenes,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> I ſhall begin my diſcourſe of that which ariſeth from Pain with Flux of humours and Inflammation. Theſe moſt frequently attend great Contuſions, Gun-ſhot Wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by ſuffocating the native Heat produce Mortification. In which caſes a cooling and ſlender Diet ought to be obſerved: the Humours abounding in the body muſt be evacuated by Bleeding and Purging: Revulſion ought alſo to be made to avert the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from flowing to the diſeaſed Parts. For the rationall performing of which I refer you to the Chapter of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> in the Treatiſe of <hi>Tumours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Cordials and Epithems are alſo neceſſary, to reſiſt the Putrefaction, and ſtrengthen the Vitalls, from what cauſe ſoever the Gangrene ariſeth. For your choice of which I refer you to the Chapter of a <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Gangrene. Having thus provided in generall, we ſhall in the next place conſider the Part affected, whether it be onely a Tumour, or a Wound with a Tumour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which latter, if the Tumour and Inflammation have been very great, and it change colour ſuddenly, and ſink, the Pain continuing, you may conclude a Gangrene beginning. And if there be a Wound or Abſceſſe, and that Wound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> grow more painfull, if the Fleſh alſo looſe its ruddineſs, and look pale and withered, and the Matter change to be thin and gleety, you may ſuſpect it corrupting: in which caſe it will be neceſſary that you ſcarifie to the quick, and make it bleed freely. By your Patient's ſenſible feeling, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:95669:231"/>by the freſh trickling down of the bloud, you may judge of the Mortification. But if the Gangrene have crept deeper, or aroſe from the bottome of the Wound, then ſcarifie accordingly unto the fleſhy Parts: and if there be any Abſceſſe lying under the Muſcles or Lips of the Wound or Ulcer, let it out. If in making ſuch Scarification you chance to cut ſome Veſſell, whereby a Flux of bloud happeneth, have a care you choak not the Heat of the Part by crowding in Doſſills; for ſo the Mortification may be encreaſed. To avoid which, I do rather adviſe the actuall Cautery, for thereby you will not onely ſtop the Bleeding, but dry up the Putrefaction. After the uſe of it, dreſſe up the Wound as hath been adviſed in the Chapter of Burning. If in ſcarifying you prick a Nerve or Tendon, you will encreaſe the Gangrene. So you may doe if by the actuall Cautery you burn them but in part, or if you apply ſharp Medicaments on them when newely hurt by Scarification. For we frequently ſee great Fluxion ariſe from little Diſturbances of the Nerves and Tendons. Therefore conſider well, and if ſuch lie in your way, you had better cut them off or burn them through, then ſcratch or prick them. For the confirmation hereof, you may ſee ſome Inſtances in the Cure of Ulcers amongſt the Nerves and Tendons in the Treatiſe <hi>de Strumis.</hi> Whilſt I was writing this, I cut off ſome of them in one Patient: they lying over the carious Bones would not admit of the coverture of a Pledgit without grievous Pain; but thoſe once divided, the Ulcer grew eaſy. But if you meet with none of theſe Accidents, then, after Scarification, cleanſe it of the clotted bloud, by waſhing it with Brine, a ſtrong <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Wood-aſhes, or Tincture of Myrrh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fill up the Scarification with <hi>Merc. praecipitat. troch. polyidae, muſae,</hi> or with Doſſills dipt in <hi>ol. garyophyll. terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. actually hot. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguent.

The uſuall Fomentation is a <hi>Lixivium</hi> wherein have been boiled <hi>ſummit. abſinth. centaur. min. carduus benedict. ſcordium, vincetoxic. rad. ariſtoloch. rot. rad. gentian. ſpir. vini,</hi> &amp;c. or that of <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> with a Solution of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> or <hi>aq. lap. medicament.</hi> Cataplaſms are alſo of uſe <hi>exfar. hord. fabar. lupinor. lentium, piſor.

                     <p>In the dreſſing of theſe Mortifications, you ought to conſider well in the application of your Medicaments, that you do not in the extinguiſhing one Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene raiſe another, by the too long uſe of ſharp Medicaments. Therefore, when you ſhall feel the Ulcer warm, and find it ceaſe gleeting, it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to forbear the uſe of them, and to dreſſe it up with warm Digeſtives, as <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. terebinth.</hi> hot: and after Digeſtion deterge with <hi>mundif. ex apio magiſt.</hi> or ſuch like, according as the Sloughs require; then proceed by Sarcoticks and Epuloticks, as in ſuch Ulcers hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>OF Gangrenes from ſtrict Bandage you may ſee ſeverall Inſtances in this Book. The Cure differeth not from that of others made by Fluxion:<note place="margin">1.

I ſhall give you one Inſtance here of a fractured Leg ſet in the Country by one pretending to Bone-ſetting. It had been bound up with Splints. About the third day after, I paſſing that way was deſired to ſee him. The Fracture was of both the Focills of the left Leg. He had been in great pain from the time of the ſetting: it was extremely ſwelled from the Knee to the Toes. I ſaw it was occaſioned by the too ſtreight
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95669:232"/>Binding. I therefore looſened the Bandage, and took off the Splints, the ends of them ſticking in the Skin, as alſo did the two Ligatures which encompaſſed the Fracture. Many Bliſters were raiſed, not onely about the Fracture, but alſo about the Foot; ſome whereof were blew, and others of a dark red colour. I ſcarified them, permitted them to bleed, and fomented the Member with Stupes wrung out of hot Milk: by which I gave a tranſpiration to the Humours, then dreſſed the Gangrene-ſpots with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> hot, and applying an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Cerote over all the Leg, laid it upon a ſoft Pillow, with <hi>Splenia</hi> of Cloaths under it, which I faſtened about the fractured Member; and bringing the ſides of the Pillow cloſe to the Leg, it was ſupported with much eaſe: then I let the Patient bloud. By this way of dreſſing, the bloud circulated, the Pain accordingly diminiſhed, and ſo did the Swelling, and the gangrened Parts digeſted off, and healed by the application of <hi>unguent. diapompholyg.</hi> &amp;c. After the diminution of theſe Accidents, the Leg was dreſſed up cloſer, and the fractured Bones united together, according to the method ſet down in the Treatiſe of Fractures; where alſo you will find a Gangrene ariſing from Fluxion occaſioned by the Shivers of Bones, with the manner of its Cure.</p>
                     <p>Of Gangrenes ariſing from Gun-ſhot I have ſhewed you ſufficiently in the preceding Treatiſe, and in the Obſervations of <hi>Phlegmon</hi> have treated of thoſe riſing from Inflammation, to which I refer you; and ſhall now give you ſome ariſing from other Cauſes, and firſt from Fluxion.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of a full Body having accidentally broken his Shin by a Fall,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene on a contuſed Wound.</note> the Wound inflamed, and grew very painfull. It not yielding to their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, I was fetched, and ſaw the Heat decaying, and Bliſters riſing about the Lips of the Wound, alſo a thin <hi>Ichor</hi> dropping from the contuſed Fleſh. I cut out the bruiſed Fleſh, ſcarified the Wound, and dabbed it with <hi>ol. tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binth.</hi> then fill'd it up with Praecipitate, and applied <hi>unguent. baſil.</hi> warm with ſome of the ſaid Oil, and a Cataplaſm over all of wheaten Bread-crums decocted in Brandy, with the addition of Saffron, Yolks of eggs, and <hi>mel communis;</hi> then let him bloud, preſcribed a Clyſter that afternoon, and laid him to bed with an Anodyne draught. The next day I came better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but in taking off the Dreſſings, I ſaw the Wound dry, and felt it warm, and took notice of a ſmall Eſcar made by the former Application over it. The Lips of the Wound inclined to a Digeſtion. I fomented it, and dreſſed it up with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum ol. terebinth.</hi> and repeated the uſe of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm: by which Dreſſings the Wound digeſted, and the Parts about reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their naturall Heat, and he was cured by Deterſives, Sarcoticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a hollow Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>A Woman came out of the Country to me with an Ulcer in her Leg.<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Leg.</note> It had been of a long continuance, and by reaſon of her Journey it inflamed and ſwelled. When I ſaw it, the Heat was decaying, and the Tumour was ſinking; Bliſters were riſen near the Lips, and the Skin under ſome of them was of a purple, and under others of a blew colour. The Ulcer it ſelf being putrefied, I ſcarified it and the Parts about ſo far as I thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, permitting them to bleed freely, and thruſt out the rotten Fleſh: then I fomented them with Brine, ſprinkled the Scarifications wth <hi>Merc. praecip.</hi> and dreſt up the Ulcer with Doſſills dipt in a Solution of <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac. in ſpir. vini,</hi> to which I added ſome of the ſaid Praecipitate, and applied a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of <hi>medull. panis tritic. pulv. ſummit. abſinth. flor. centaur. rutae, ſcord. cham.</hi> decocted in Brandy-wine. After I had thus dreſt her, I let her bloud, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to reſt with a Cordiall draught. Her Body was the next day made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble by Clyſters, and afterwards by lenient Purgatives.</p>
                     <p>At the next dreſſing I was provided with a Fomentation and Cataplaſm, as
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:95669:232"/>is propoſed in the method of Cure. I ſcarified again the Lips and Parts about, and deſigned as much to the Ulcer: but in taking off the Dreſſings, I felt it warm, and a kind of Eſcar made by the foreſaid Dreſſing. I therefore dreſt it with <hi>unguent. baſil. &amp; ol. terebinth.</hi> hot, and applied the Cataplaſm over all. By theſe Applications the Ulcer and Parts about were reſtored to their native Heat, and the Soar digeſted, and afterwards healed with Sarcoticks, as is uſuall in ſuch like Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>A Lady aged about 63 years, of a very fat groſs Body,<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Elbow.</note> was ſeized with an Apoplectick fit, which afterward terminated in ſome kind of Lethargy, with loſs of Memory. During which, ſhe lying in bed, and leaning for the moſt part on her Elbow, bruiſed it, and at length the Putrefaction reaching to the Skin, it inflamed, and ſeemed to have Matter. Some Pretenders to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, judging it a ſimple Apoſtemation, thought it not worthy the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Chirurgeon, but opened it and put in a Tent with <hi>baſilicon,</hi> and left it to an Apothecary to dreſs by their direction, not forbidding the Patient to lie upon it. It being thus dreſt, the Putrefaction within increaſed, and ſpred up towards that <hi>Axilla,</hi> and ſhe died of that Mortification before it was diſcovered by them, ſo that the Chirurgeon came in onely time enough to embalm her.</p>

                           </gap>ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Leg.</note> having been long diſeaſed with an Ulcer in his right Leg about the Ancle, came up to Town, and ſent for me. The Lips of the Ulcer were without Tumour or Heat: the Fleſh within the Ulcer was livid, and in ſome parts of a blackiſh colour, and diſcharged a gleety Matter. Indeed there were all the ſigns of a <hi>Sphacelus:</hi> yet the Patient talked of going abroad the next morning; and by his other diſcourſe ſeemed to be ſomewhat delirous. I fomented his Leg with a Stupe wrung hot out of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine; and whilſt I provided other Dreſſings, I prevailed with him to ſend for an eminent Phyſician dwelling near his Lodging, to whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the condition of the Ulcer, and undreſſed it in his preſence, ſcarify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lips and Parts within, then waſht it with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> hot, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> &amp;c. with a Cataplaſm <hi>è medull. panis tritic. pulv. ſummit. abſinth.</hi> with <hi>ſcord.</hi> &amp;c. decocted in Brandy-wine. The next day a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held of two Phyſicians, Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> Chirurgeons, with my ſelf. We took off the Dreſſings, and found the Ulcer ſphacelated, but not much ſpred externally. The Patient had reſted ill, and was delirous, and his Pulſe weak. We ſcarified the Lips and Ulcer, and permitted them to bleed; then fomented the Member, and dreſt the Mortification with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and applied a Cataplaſm as above preſcribed. We continued our Endeavours daily: but the Venome ſpred up and down that ſide of the Foot amongſt the Bones and Tendons. The Phyſicians preſcribed Cordialls. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but his <hi>Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> &amp;c. increaſed, and he died before it had encompaſſed any part of the Leg.</p>
                     <p>Cold extinguiſheth the naturall Heat of a Part, and frequently happens to poor people travelling in Froſt and Snow. Some Inſtances I have ſeen of this Gangrene. The Recovery of them is not very difficult, if timely treated; otherwiſe they ſphacelate, as other Gangrenes do. When any particular Part beginneth to decay in its naturall Heat, the common Remedy is, to rub it with Snow, and afterwards to foment it with Decoctions of Turneps or of the hotter Plants, ſuch as are uſually found in every Kitchin-Garden; then to embrocate it <hi>cum ol. lini, rutae, aneth.</hi> and <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> mixt with them; and after to lap it up in woollen Cloaths. But if any Part be directly gangrened, we ſcarifie and dreſs it as hath been ſaid in the method of Cure. If the whole Body be over-cooled, the Cure conſiſts in the uſing Brandy, <hi>aq. vitae,</hi> and other good Spirits, <hi>theriac.</hi> and Mithridate diſſolved in Wine, and laying the Patient
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95669:233"/>by the Fire, but not too near, or putting him into a warm Bed, and d ſpoſing him to ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Of Gangrene through deficiency of Heat in Old age I ſhall onely give you one Inſtance,<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene through old age.</note> and that in a perſon of a very great age. He is yet alive, and kept ſo by the great Kindneſs of a noble Kinſman, with whom he hath a good Chamber well furniſhed, good Firing, Diet, and Attendance. This Gentleman was ſeized the laſt Spring with a ſimple Inflammation about the Ancle without Tumour. Upon notice thereof I went the next day, and ſaw it turned black three inches in length, and about two in breadth. We fomented the Part with a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of warm Plants, to which we added Brandy; then ſcarified the Eſcar, and dapped it with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> and after dreſt. it with a Mixture of the ſame Oil <hi>cum unguent. baſilic.</hi> embrocating the Parts about with <hi>ol. lumbricor.</hi> &amp;c. and applied a Plaiſter <hi>ex theriaca.</hi> Thus the Eſcar ſeparated, and my Kinſman <hi>Jaq. Wiſeman</hi> dreſſed and cured it. Before this was cicatrized, the inſide of the other Leg upon the Ancle-joynt inflamed as largely, and turned black: but by the ſame way of dreſſing a ſeparation was made of that Eſcar, and he was cured by my ſaid Kinſman according to the common method of Ulcers: but it was well-nigh the work of four months. Since that, new Inflammations have begun to ariſe more then once, but hitherto have been timely remitted.</p>
                     <p>From an indiſpoſition or malign quality of the Humours within our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Mortifications frequently ariſe; inſomuch that we can ſcarce make a Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell in ſome Bodies without running the hazzard of a Gangrene: nor indeed can they be kept from Defluxion after they are made, without the aſſiſtence of our Art. Inſtances hereof may be ſeen in ſeverall places of this Book, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Treatiſe of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers with Intemperies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Woman of about ſixty years of age,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Arm.</note> extreme fat, and of a Scorbutick Habit of body, ſent for a Chirurgeon to make her a Fontanell in her Arm. He cut it, and put in a Pea. She diſcharged him, and dreſſed it her ſelf. About ten or twelve days after the Fontanell growing painfull, ſhe ſent for the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, who ſeeing it gangrened, ſent for me. The impreſſion of the Pea into the Fat before it was digeſted had corrupted that, and the Parts about were thereby infected. We ſcarified the Lips, and cut into the Fat I believe above an inch deep. We dreſt it with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> actually hot upon an armed Probe, filled up the Inciſion with Praecipitate, and applied a Cataplaſm of Mithridate. By this method of dreſſing the Heat was reſtored, and it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in few days, and I left it to the Chirurgeon, who cured it.</p>
                     <p>In a perſon of about fourty years of age I applied a mild Cauſtick below on the inſide of the Knee,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Knee.</note> to make a Fontanell. The Eſcar being ſmall, I divided and digeſted it with little or no Pain; and the Eſcar began to ſeparate kindly: but it afterwards grew painfull and gleeted, and the Ulcer corrupted very deep before the firſt Eſcar ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>This happened whilſt the Patient dreſſed it her ſelf with thoſe Dreſſings I left her Servant, ſhe not taking much heed of it, till ſhe was ſo lame that ſhe could not ſtir out of her Chamber; and then ſhe ſent for me, and to my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement I ſaw it gangrened. I preſently cut out the looſe Eſcar, fomented it with Wine, and dabbed it <hi>cum ol. terebinth.</hi> hot with an armed Probe, then lightly ſcarified it in the bottome and edges, and after dabbed it again with <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> filled it up with Praecipitate, and fomented it till I had made a Cataplaſm <hi>cum medull. panis triticei, pulv. ſummitat. abſinth. &amp; ſcord.</hi> decocted in Wine, with an addition of Brandy, Saffron and the Yolk of an egge, which I applied over it, having firſt embrocated the Parts about it <hi>cum ol. roſ.</hi> Thus in three or four dreſſings I took off the Fluxion, and the ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lips digeſted; but the Ulcer it ſelf lay dry, till the Sloughs made by the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95669:233"/>Praecipitate caſt off by Digeſtion. From that time it incarned, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted nearer I dreſſed it with a Pea. It was very remarkable, that whilſt the Ulcer was diſtempered ſhe was free from her other Complaints; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was digeſted ſhe relapſed into her former Diſtempers, and lay ſome daies ill of a bilious Cholick. In ſeverall others I have ſeen the like in ſpight of all my endeavours to prevent it. So alſo in making Fontanells ſometimes by Inciſion in people where there was no likelihood of preſſing on a Tendon, I have been glad to throw out the Pea, and heal them up again.</p>
                     <p>But as people are ſometimes ſubject to Gangrene by making of Fontanells; ſo others we hear of that have been gangrened from paring of a Corn or Nail on their Toes. Amongſt the Obſervations of a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> you may ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of it ariſing from a leſſe cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I was once ſent for to a Perſon of Honour about ſixty years of age.<note place="margin">9. Obſervat. of a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Toe.</note> He was of a full Body, and ſeemingly healthfull; but in his latter years had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Exerciſe, by reaſon of a Stone in his left Kidney. One morning in making himſelf ready he perceived a black Spot on the upper part of his Foot leading towards the Toe next the little one. It was no bigger then a Spangle, without Tumour, Pain or Inflammation. It appearing bigger the next morning, he ſent for his Phyſician and Chirurgeon; they cut into it, and found it inſenſible. From that time it was rationally dreſſed; but it inlarged it ſelf amongſt the Tendons, and eſpecially toward that Toe, and affected the Bones. I being then conſulted, and joyned with that Chirurgeon, we cut off that Toe, and checked the Mortification. After which with much difficulty we extinguiſhed the Gangrene in the other Parts by the various Applications preſcribed in the method of Cure, and healed the ſinuous Ulcer. During which the Phyſician purged him frequently, and preſcribed an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorbutick Decoction of <hi>ſarſa, China, lign. guaiaci,</hi> with the Plants proper in ſuch caſes, to diſpoſe him to ſweat; which he did ſome days. One eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whilſt he was ſweating, I being accidentally preſent, he told me he felt a numneſſe in the Balls of his toes of the other Foot. I looked upon them, and ſeeing them all black and dry, cut into them, and found them inſenſible. I ſuppoſed they might have been burnt by the Bricks: but neither the Patient nor the Apothecary that ſweat him having diſcovered any thing of it before, we concluded it from the malignity of the Humour, for they were directly gangrened; and by that method I cured them ſome weeks after. But three or four days after that he was ſeized with an Apoplexy about eleven a clock one Sunday morning. He recovered out of that Fit, but died that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in another.</p>
                     <p>Some other Inſtances I could give of this kind; but this may ſerve to ſhew you to what little purpoſe Amputations are in theſe caſes. But if the Body be youthfull, and the Habit of body tolerable, if Gangrenes reſiſt the Applications above propoſed, and penetrate more inwardly, you may then attempt them by the actuall Cautery. For, according to that Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Actuall Cautery.</note>

                     <p>The actuall Cautery doth indeed not onely reſiſt Putrefaction, but corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borates the Part.</p>
                     <p>But after all our vigilancy and induſtry in contriving Remedies to reſiſt the Gangrene, if it does yet delude us, and terminate in a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> There is then no more need of taking indication from antecedent cauſes, or changing
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95669:234"/>of Medicines according to the variety of the cauſes that introduced it. For whether a Gangrene ariſe from an hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> or cold, moiſt or dry, <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is always the ſame, extinction of the native Heat, and deſtruction of the Member. The Mortification creepeth on, and not onely infecteth the Member, but the Spirits to the very Heart, with its corrupt Vapours morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Veſſells all along the ſound Parts, and leaving the Member immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,<note place="margin">Extirpa. ion.</note> without ſenſe or heat, rotten, black and cadaverous. Wherefore there is nothing more to be thought of in this caſe but timely Amputation or cutting off the Member; the Cure of this Diſeaſe not confiſting (as I ſaid) in outward Applications, but manuall Operation: and what ſucceſſe may be therefrom expected, is much to be doubted. <hi>At ſatius erit,</hi> with <hi>Celſus, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps auxilium experiri, quàm nullum.</hi> It is a miſerable kind of help; yet it is the determination of all Authours, that in <hi>Sphacelus membrum corruptum abſcindendum eſt.</hi> In this caſe it becomes the Chirurgeon to acquaint the Friends with this kind of Remedy, and withall to make his Prognoſtick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But before we proceed in this Operation, we ſhall take notice of what ſome knowing Authours have writ hereof. For in thoſe places where Amputation cannot be made, as in the Buttock, Shoulder, Back, <hi>&amp;c. Fab. Hildanus</hi> propoſeth the uſe of potentiall Cauteries applied to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Part, and often renewed, till the laſt Eſcar reacheth to the live Fleſh. Yet he condemneth Arſenick, as being venomous, and producing many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Symptoms. It is true, that I my ſelf have often uſed that method of Cure in <hi>Sarcomata</hi> with good ſucceſſe: but in a Mortification there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me many greater Inconveniences that attend it. Firſt, from the Cauſtick it ſelf, as he propoſeth it, of Salts: it will melt in the working, and is more diſpoſed to ſpread in the Skin then penetrate deep into the Fleſh. This every young Chirurgeon knows in his making of Fontanells, that he cannot apply a bit of Cauſtick ſo little, though he uſe all his Art in defending it, but that it will have ſpred much farther then he deſigned it. Then the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Eſcars is too ſlow to effect the deſign: and in an ill Habit of body ſuch Medicaments are apt of themſelves to procure a Mortification rather then Cure. Whereas on the contrary, an actuall Cauterie anſwers all Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it not onely conſumeth the Mortification, but drieth up the venomous Humour, thereby preventing its farther progreſſe; and alſo communicateth warmth to the languiſhing Parts, by virtue of which the Separation is much farthered, and by working upon the gangrened Sloughs performed more eaſily, as you may ſee in my Practice elſewhere. But where Amputation it ſelf is fecible, nay altogether neceſſary, as in the Lims, there ariſeth a new queſtion, whether it ought to be done in the ſound Part, or in the dead. <hi>Fab. ab Aquapend.</hi> adviſeth the dead Part within a finger's breadth of the live, (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo do many others.) Then with a Cautery they burn up all the remaining Mortification. Others do perform the Operation with a hot Knife, the figure of which you may ſee in <hi>Hildanus. Aquapend.</hi> ſpeaks ſo confidently of his ſucceſs in the practice of this way, that utterly to deny the thing were to give him the Lie. I ſhall onely make this Objection, that the <hi>Sphacelus</hi> doth ſeldome affect the Member ſo equally round, as that an Operation in the dead Part is fecible: nay, which is worſe, when once the Mortification ſeizeth on the great Veſſels, it runneth up ſo faſt under the Skin, that before any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Member is outwardly gangrened on the one ſide beyond the Knee or Elbow, the other ſide will have reached to the <hi>Inguen</hi> or <hi>Axilla.</hi> This I confeſſe fruſtrates all manner of Amputating, whether in ſound or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Parts. Yet generally ſpeaking, the Gangrene doth not grow ſo faſt, but that if you make Amputation two fingers breadth, more or leſſe, within
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:95669:234"/>the live Fleſh, you may prevent it; and that far better then it is poſſible to be done by the other way of operating. For if you work there by actuall Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with a hot Knife, your Knife will ſtick faſt in the Fleſh till the moiſture be wholly dried up, and then you muſt repeat many Knives and Cauteries, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of which you will meet with the ſame inconvenience: yea, before you can cut through with your hot Knife, it is very probable that you will near the Bone meet with ſome Parts that are alive and ſenſible, eſpecially when you come to the <hi>Perioſteum;</hi> (for the Membranes do not uſually corrupt at the ſame rate of ſwiftneſſe with the Fleſh;) and then all your pains and trouble with be as great or greater then if you did it in the ſound Part. As to the other inconveniences, I ſhall refer you to <hi>Hildanus,</hi> who hath taken pains in confuting this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Both theſe ways of Amputation ſeem to me much more difficult and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then our common way; which makes me preſume they propoſed them to prevent the effuſion of bloud.</p>
                     <p>But modern Chirurgeons have anſwered this Objection by good Bandages and Deligation of the Veſſells, and when we cut above the Knee, by clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Cauteries to the Veſſels onely; which ſufficiently anſwers that Intention. Thus have I ſeen in my firſt Sea-voiages Amputations made above Knee, and afterwards practiſed them with great eaſe and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince not onely in this Chapter of Gangrene,<note place="margin">The manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> but frequently elſewhere in this Book, we have mentioned Amputation, I think it neceſſary to take this occaſion of ſhewing the manner of performing it; the rather, becauſe the Operation is much the ſame, whether it be done upon the account of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, or for other reaſons. I ſhall therefore in generall terms inſert the whole Doctrine of Amputation, though briefly, not mattering whether the Examples inſtances be <hi>Sphaceli</hi> or not, all Inſtances being alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
                     <p>In heat of Fight, whether it be at Sea or Land,<note place="margin">What is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in heat of fight.</note> the Chirurgeon ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at the firſt Dreſſing, what poſſibility there is of preſerving the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Member; and accordingly, if there be no hopes of ſaving it, to make his Amputation at that inſtant whilſt the Patient is free of Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you may the better make your judgement of the Wounds, I ſhall give you ſome few Remarques of ſuch as require Amputation. <hi>viz.</hi> If a Leg or Arm be ſhattered by Splinter or great Shot, the loſſe of Subſtance will direct you. If the principall Muſcles be torn off, and the Bone fractured in pieces, or if the Wound be with Musket-ſhot in the inſide of the Joynt of the Elbow, or in the Knee or Ancle, with a Fracture of the Bones of the ſaid Joynt, nay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it hath not fractured them, yet if the Bullet be ſo lodged that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extract it, you ſhall then preſently make Extirpation of the Part. If it be the Arm, cut it off in the place where it is ſo ſhattered, and ſaw off the end of the Bone ſmooth, your Aſſiſtent the while pulling up the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Skin and Fleſh. If the Ancle be thus maimed, you ſhall then cut off the Leg within three or four fingers breadth under the Knee, in regard ſo long a Stump would be troubleſome. But if the Leg be ſhattered off by the Calf, do not put your Patient to the pain of new Amputation for the ſhortning it a hand's breadth or a little more. Save what you can of a ſhattered Hand. And if the Toes with part of the Foot were ſhot off, cut off the lacerated Parts ſmooth, but with care to ſave as much of the Foot with the Heel as you can; it being much better then a wooden Leg. But if the Arm or Leg be not ſo ſhatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though the Wound be large on one ſide, and hang gaping down with great Fracture of Bones, yet be not diſcouraged, the largeneſs of the Wound will make for your better pulling out thoſe extraneous bodies, Shivers, Splinters,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:95669:235"/>Rags, or ought elſe, and for the eaſier diſcharge of Matter. Dreſs it as a Wound by a Splinter.</p>
                     <p>If the great Joynt be ſo ſhot by Musket-bullet, that you think it not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to cut off the Member, be ſure you make Extraction of the Bullet, and free it of all extraneous bodies, leaving not the leaſt Shiver to prick the Nerves or Tendons: and make ſuch way preſently, that you may be able to dreſſe the wounded Nerves, Tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without making new Inciſion, when the Part is inflamed and unfit for it.</p>
                     <p>If after ſome days the Wound do not digeſt, but inflame and gangrene, and the Gangrene do not yield to your Applications as hath been propoſed in Gangrene; then, as in a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> you are to proceed with the Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that rotten Member while the Patient is free from <hi>Delirium,</hi> and hath ſtrength to bear the Operation.</p>
                     <p>Seat him ſo as it may be for your conveniency. At Sea they ſit or lie, I never took much notice which; nor do I remember I had ever any body to hold them; but with the help of my Mates, and ſome one or two that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Hold, I went on with my work. At <hi>Sterling</hi> I made an Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation above the Knee, and had as little help; beſides my Servants, there was onely a Sea-Chirurgeon aſſiſting me. We ſtopt the Flux of bloud by actuall Cautery, and the Wound digeſted and cured without any ill Accident. Yet where we have convenience to proceed more formally, we always place the Patient to our moſt advantage, where he may be held firm, and in a clear light, and ſo that our Aſſiſtents may come better about us. The Member is to be ſupported by ſome one, whilſt another ſtandeth behind the Patient, and draweth up the Skin and Muſculous fleſh. Then make your Ligature two fingers breadth or thereabout in the ſound Part; ſo that if you am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putate in caſe of Mortification, you may be ſure to quit your ſelf of it. This Ligature is omitted by many of our Chirurgeons here in the City, they onely making a turn with a Tape, pinning it on as a mark to circumcide by: and in ſtead of the Ligature I propoſe, they make a Gripe, which Gripe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made by ſome Aſſiſtent who hath ſtréngth to do it. Indeed this is good, where a ſhattered Member is to be cut off, to ſmooth the Stump; in which caſe there is no great fear of Bleeding. But in Amputations it ſeems to me to be very inconvenient: for I never yet ſaw any man ſo gripe, but that ſtill the Artery bled with a greater force then was allowable; yea, when Mr. <hi>Woodall</hi> griped, who was ſo applauded, and in truth made for the work. It being ſo, in what a huddle is the Stump then dreſt? But ſuppoſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie poſture and the long griping tires the Griper, or that his Hand be crampt the while, what condition is the Patient then in? Whereas by this ancient way of Ligature the Veſſells are ſecured from Bleeding, the Member benummed, and the Fleſh held ſteady, ready to receive the impreſſion of your crooked Knife, (or Razour, which I have often amputated with.) This Ligature made, the Aſſiſtent ſtrengthens it, whilſt he draws up the Muſculous fleſh. In the mean time the Operatour, with a ſharp crooked Knife, by a turn with his hand cuts the Fleſh off round to the Bone; then with the back of it he ſcrapes the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> from the Bone; if there be two Bones, then with a dividing Knife he ſeparates the fleſhy Membrane from them. The Bones freed of the <hi>Perioſteum, Guido</hi> propoſes a linen Cloath, and <hi>Hildanus</hi> a kind of Purſe, to be brought over the upper divided Fleſh, to pull it upward, and make more way for the Saw. But I think that needleſſe. The Fleſh divided, the Parts ſeparate enough of themſelves, beſides the Aſſiſtent's pulling up the muſculous Fleſh and Skin is ſufficient. That done, you are at liberty, whether you will cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize the Veſſells by a Button-cautery, or by Ligature ſtop the Bleeding, or
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95669:235"/>by Agglutination. The uſe of <hi>Chalcanthum</hi> I do not approve. To apply Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks to the ends of the Nerves and Tendons newly inciſed, cauſes great pain, weakens the Part, and makes way for Gangrene; it not being likely you can ſo apply them to the Artery, but that you muſt burn the Parts about, which are, as I ſaid, the Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The way <hi>Hildanus</hi> propoſes, by drawing the Veſſels out by a <hi>Forceps,</hi> is not a work to be done in heat of Fight, nor without a clear day-light. If you attempt it on Land, his Arm would be bowed, and his Leg ſtretcht out, that the Veſſells may be the longer after Extirpation, that you may the better take hold of them. <hi>Ambroſ. Par.</hi> propoſes a more eaſie and ſure way of Deligation, by paſſing a Needle with a ſtrong twiſted Thread through the Skin near the great Veſſels; making your Stitch over the ſaid Veſſells by piercing through the raw Fleſh and Skin: then make your Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon a fold of a Rag. Thus you bind the Artery and Vein. Theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ways have been practiſed by eminent Chirurgeons for the ſtopping the bloud of the Arteries in Amputation: but the late diſcovery of the Royal Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick hath rendered them of leſſe uſe. But in heat of Fight it will be neceſſary to have your actuall Cauterie always ready, for that will ſecure the bleeding Arteries in a moment, and fortifie the Part againſt future Putrefaction: they requiring after Cauterization no ſuch ſtrict Bandage as that thereby you need to fear interception of the Spirits. When we cauterize the Artery, we do then touch the end of the Bone, it haſtening the Exfoliation. The next thing is the looſening the Ligature, and bringing the Lips cloſe over the Stump. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhould with a croſſe Stitch hold them ſo, or content your ſelf by Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage as well as you can, is by ſome controverted. They that object againſt the former ſay, it cauſes Pain and Inflammation. So doth Bandage alſo, if it be made too ſtreight. Therefore they ſhould object againſt that alſo. The moſt that I have ſeen without the croſſe Stitch have the next dreſſing been broad Stumps, ſome of them with Lips turned outward by the Bandage; in the leaſt of them the whole Stump hath been bare: whereas in thoſe in which I have made the croſſe Stitch, the Lips have been found cloſe to the Bone at the next dreſſing, covering the great Veſſells, and a third part or half of the Stump hath been well digeſted, and by the ſecond dreſſing hath been near agglutinated ſo far as it lay under that Skin, and without Inflammation happily cured. Whereas the broad Stump is a certain ſign of a long Cure, and commonly the death of the Patient. The expoſing theſe inciſed Parts too much to the Air cauſes Pain, and the want of native Heat makes them gleet: or if they do digeſt, the diſcharge of ſo great a quantity of Matter commonly exhauſts the Spirits of the Patient. If the muſculous Fleſh and Skin are well pulled up in time of Amputation, and brought over by a moderate Extenſion as far as they will eaſily admit, you will find it not painfull. You ought to pierce the Skin with a Needle and ſtrong brown Thread ceared about half an inch from the edges of the Lips. Having made them croſſe from ſide to ſide equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tie them with a moderate Aſtriction, then apply a Pledgit on the cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Veſſells with <hi>pulv. irid. ſuce. cepar. cum melle.</hi> But if no Cautery was uſed, then Buttons of Tow ſpred with your Reſtrictive, and dipt in <hi>pulv. Galeni,</hi> muſt be applied to the Mouths of the Veſſels. Afterwards ſprinkle the Stump thick with this Powder; ℞ <hi>bol.

This latter muſt be ſnipt deep in the edges, that it may lie ſmooth about the Member. An Oxe-bladder ready
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95669:236"/>cut and wet is to be turned over it, and a croſſe Cloath next the Bladder, to hold the Dreſſings ſteady. Then with a Rowler with two heads begin upon the Stump, and rowl up to the next Joint, and ſo again about the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to retain your Dreſſings firm. Then faſten it ſo as that it may not be capable of falling off. But before you make this Bandage, you ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your Defenſative over the Parts above the Stump. Some apply it before they begin the Amputation: but then it is apt to wrinkle, and to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie. In the dreſſing of the Stumps, you ought ſo to apply your Medicaments, that you may without much bungle rowl up the Member. Then place it to the eaſe of the Patient, one holding his Hand ſome while upon the Stump. Your Defenſative may be of the ſame which is preſcribed in Gun-ſhot Wounds: or, ℞ <hi>far. hord. bol.

                     <p>Whilſt I was a Priſoner at <hi>Cheſter</hi> after the Battell of <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervation of the ill conſequences of wounds in the Joynts.</note> I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Col. <hi>Duckenfield</hi>'s order to a man that out of much zeal to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> purſuing our ſcattered Forces, was ſhot through the Joynt of the Elbow; the Bullet entring in at the externall part of the <hi>Os humeri,</hi> and paſſing out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and <hi>Radius.</hi> He had been afflicted with great Pain the ſpace of ſix weeks. I found the Wound undigeſted, and full of a looſe ſoft white Fleſh, the Bones fractured, and not likely to unite, many Shivers lying included within the Joynts, and incapable of being drawn out: the lower part of the Arm was oedematous to the Fingers ends as full as the Skin could well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the upper part was inflamed, alſo about the <hi>Os humeri</hi> and <hi>Axilla</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Phlegmon</hi> was formed. The Patient thus tired with Pain, deſired to be cured, or have his Arm cut off. To which purpoſe he had procured the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's leave for my ſtaying with him. But while that <hi>Phlegmon</hi> was upon the upper parts, there was no hope of a proſperous Amputation, nor of Cure while thoſe Shivers of Bones lay pricking the Nervous parts within the Joynt. The <hi>Phlegmon</hi> was too forward for Repercuſſion, and yet not likely to ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in leſſe then a week's time. Wherefore I endeavoured by Emollients and ſomewhat Diſcutients to ſuccour the grieved Shoulder and Parts thereabout by hindering the increaſe of the <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> and to give ſome perſpiration to the Part. Then with good Fomentations I corroborated the weak and oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Member below: to which end I alſo raiſed his Hand nearer to his Breaſt. Alſo by Detergents and Bandage I diſpoſed the Wounds and fractured Part to a better condition, made way for diſcharge of Matter, and endeavoured to extract the Shivers of Bones; then applied Medicaments to remove the <hi>Caries.</hi> After ſome days the Abſceſſe ſuppurated in the upper part of the Shoulder and in the Arm-pit; and while the Matter diſcharged from thence, the Tumour diſcuſſed, and that upper Orifice cured ſoon after. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Pain in the fractured Joynt kept that Opening in the <hi>Axilla</hi> from healing. The Patient growing weaker, and without hopes of Cure, I was neceſſitated to proceed to Amputation. To which purpoſe I ſent to <hi>Cheſter</hi> for Mr. <hi>Murry,</hi>
                        <pb n="455" facs="tcp:95669:236"/>a knowing Chirurgeon, (ſince Mayor of that City,) to come with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other neceſſaries whereby I might the better doe the work. He accordingly came, and we prepared Dreſſings ready; which were Stupes or Pledgits of fine ſhort Tow well workt, ſome like <hi>Splenia,</hi> others were round, and bigger or leſſe. We wetted them all in Oxycrate, and dried them. We alſo made ſome Buttons of Tow, Compreſſes of linen Cloaths dipt in Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, three or four Rowlers with one or two heads; provided Needles threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ceared for making the croſſe Stitch, and leſſer Needles threaded for common uſe, with Filleting for Ligature, and Bladders ready cut and wet in Oxycrate; alſo a Defenſative of the above-mentioned preſcription ſpred upon a ſoft linen Cloath, to apply upon the Parts above more diſtant, and a Mixture of the aſtringent Powders with Whites of eggs, to ſpread upon the <hi>Splenia</hi> and Buttons, which Buttons were alſo dipt in ſome of the ſame Powders. Then for the round Pledgits which were deſigned to be applied next to the Stump, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> propoſed that they might be ſpread with a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Umber and <hi>calx viva</hi> with Whites of eggs, according to Doctour <hi>Read</hi> in his Obſervation of an Amputation he performed upon a Servant of the Lord <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s at <hi>Gerrard's Bromley,</hi> whoſe fame yet lives in that Country, and will amongſt us Chirurgeons as long as his elaborate Lectures have a being.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Apparatus</hi> thus made, and the Patient ſome while before refreſht with a draught of a good Caudle, his Friends took him out of his Bed, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in a Chair towards the light. One of his Servants held his Arm; another of his Friends held his other Hand. Then Mr. <hi>M.</hi> drew up the Skin and Muſculous fleſh of the Arm towards his Shoulder, whilſt I made a ſtrong Bandage ſome three or four fingers breadth above the affected Part. Then with a good Knife I cut off the Fleſh by a quick turn of my hand, Mr. <hi>Murry</hi> pulling up the Fleſh whilſt I bared the Bones. After which with a few motions of my Saw I ſeparated the Bone, the Patient not ſo much as whimpering the while, After this Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thruſting his hands downwards with the muſculous Fleſh and Skin which he had drawn upwards, I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſtrong Needle and Thread through the middle of the fleſh and Skin on both ſides, within half an inch of the edges, and brought the Lips cloſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a narrow compaſſe: and having tied that Ligature faſt, and cut off the String, I paſſed the Needle again through the two contrary ſides, which I tied as cloſe; then looſened the Ligature above, and applied the little round Stupes of Tow ſpred with a quantity of <hi>Galen</hi>'s Powder mixt <hi>cum album. ovi.</hi> The long Pledgits were applied from the middle of the Stump each way upwards along the Arm, over which I put on a Bladder and a croſſe Cloath, then rowled up the Stump, and made the Bandage under his other Arm and over his Neck. This Bandage prevented an Accident which hath ſince happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Patient here in <hi>London,</hi> where many of the beſt Chirurgeons were concerned. He being thus dreſt up, we put him into his Bed. The third day we took off the Dreſſings, and found the Stump well digeſted, and at leaſt two Spoonfulls of Matter diſcharged. We then dreſſed it up with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive <hi>ex terebinth. lot. in decoct. malvar.</hi> the Yolk of an egge and <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> ſpred on a large Stupe of Tow, on which was ſprinkled a proportion of <hi>Galen</hi>'s Powder: then embrocated the Parts about with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> applying <hi>emplaſt. è bolo</hi> over all, with moderate Bandage, and afterwards deterged with that of <hi>Paracelſ.</hi> and with Sarcoticks incarned the Wound. During which the Bone exfoliated, and the Stump ſoon after cicatrized. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving procured a Paſſe to come to <hi>London,</hi> I haſtened away.<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the Siege of <hi>Weymouth</hi> I was called at break of day to an <hi>Iriſh-man</hi>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:95669:237"/>of Lieutenant-Col. <hi>Ballard</hi>'s Regiment, who ſhooting off his Musket, it brake, and tore his Hand to pieces after a ſtrange manner. I deſigning to cut off his Hand, ſent preſently to my Quarters to one of my Servants to bring both Saw and Knife, alſo Dreſſings, of which at thoſe times we had always ready. They being brought, I took a red Ribbon from off my Caſe of Lancets, and bound it about his Arm ſome four fingers breadth above the <hi>Carpus;</hi> and having cut the Fleſh round off, I bared the Bones, and ſeparated the Fleſh between them. Then I ſawed off the Bones, and untied my Ligature, and bringing down the muſculous Fleſh and Skin over the end of them, without making any croſſe Stitch, I dreſt up that Stump with Reſtrictives and good Bandage, and returned again to my Quarters. I had not been one hour gone, but I was ſent for again to this Souldier, he being (as the Meſſenger ſaid) grievouſly pained. I wondred at it, and haſtned away: but before I came to his Hut, I heard him crying. I enquiring the cauſe, it was ſome while before he would anſwer me. But at laſt he told me, he was not able to endure that red Ribbon that I tied his Arm with. I was at firſt ſurprized to think I ſhould leave the Ligature upon his Arm, that being a ſure way to bring a Mortification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Part. I therefore put my hand in my Pocket, and feeling the Ribbon on the Caſe of Lancets, ſhewed it him. He ſeemed at firſt to doubt it; but after he ſaw it was ſo, he laught, and was from that time in eaſe. Two days after, our men were chaſed out of the Town and Chappell-fort. I was at the ſame time dreſſing the wounded man in the Town almoſt under the Chappell-fort, and hearing a woman cry Fly, fly, the Fort is taken; I turned aſide a little amazed towards the Line, not knowing what had been done: but getting up the Works, I ſaw our people running away, and thoſe of the Fort ſhooting at them. I ſlipt down this Work into the Ditch, and got out of the Trench; and as I began to run, hearing one call, Chirurgeon, I turned back, and ſeeing a man hold up a ſtumped Arm, I thought it was the <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> whom I had ſo lately diſmembred: whereupon I returned, and helpt him up. We ran together, it being within half a Musket-ſhot of the Enemie's Fort; but he out-ran me quite. I afterwards cured him in few weeks by the method already propoſed in the preceding Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of</hi> Fiſtulae.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> according to the vulgar denomination, is a Sinuous Ulcer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be of two or three months continuance. But to ſpeak ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe onely are <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> which are at leaſt of ſo many years growth, and are accompanied with a <hi>Callus.</hi> Every part of the body is ſubject to theſe Ulcers; but eſpecially the Arms, Legs, Thighs and Hips. The worſt ſort of theſe, at leaſt that ever I ſaw, was from Gun-ſhot Wounds with Fracture, where there hath been loſſe of Bone, or where through long continuance the <hi>Caries</hi> hath cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the Bone: in which caſes the Lips of the Wound and the Wound it ſelf become callous, by keeping them long open in order to the Exfoliation of the Bone, in which caſe the Lips grow hard, and become thick and inverted. In theſe the <hi>Sinus's</hi> are more or fewer in number, accordingly as the Abſceſſe or Wound was more or leſſe ſinuous.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Callus</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is haſtened by the tranſpiration and reſolution of the thin and ſubtill Humours,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> and the incraſſation of the more pituitous; by the congeſtion of which a long Pipe of Skin is made, which brancheth it ſelf inwards from the Orifice quite through all the Cavities of the Ulcer: from whence it hath its name.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> of theſe <hi>Fiſtulae</hi> are made not onely from the Parts affected;<note place="margin">Differences.</note> as ſome are in Fleſhy parts, others in Tendonous, or in the Bones or Joynts, or in the Breaſt, Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo from the figure, magnitude, and number of the <hi>Sinus's;</hi> as ſometimes there is onely one, then again two or three, crooked or winding till they enter the Bones themſelves.</p>
                     <p>They are known by the view, and by the touching of the Parts,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> or by ſearching with a Probe, and from the diſcharge of a thin ſerous foetid Matter, alſo from the arched Hollowneſſe they have. If by your ſearching the Parts are pained, or if bloud follows your Probe, the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> is not confirmed: but if neither happen, then it is.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> are hard to cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and thoſe of long continuance with great diſcharge of depraved Humours from the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are worſt. Thoſe amongſt the Bones and great Joynts are very difficult to cure, by reaſon of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the Parts, which for the moſt part admits neither of Dilatation nor Inciſion. Thoſe which are in ſuch places where you may ſafely lay them open, or remove the <hi>Callus,</hi> are more eaſie of Cure.</p>
                     <p>The way of <hi>Cure</hi> is performed either by manuall Operation,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> or by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments. But before you proceed in either, you are to conſider that theſe <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> are ſubject to Pain and Defluxion: wherefore you are in the firſt place to proceed by Evacuation of thoſe Humours which may diſturb you in your work; and that is done by Purging and Bleeding, good Trau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Decoctions, with obſervation of Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is ſaid in the univerſall Regiment of Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>To proceed in the Cure by manuall Operation, you are to conſider the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95669:238"/>Part affected, whether the <hi>Callus</hi> be onely in the Lips, or in the <hi>baſis</hi> of the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> or throughout the whole length of the <hi>Sinus.</hi> And this is diſcovered, as I have ſaid before, by the Probe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If there be neither Pain nor Matter, and the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be tending onely down directly to the Bone, it will then be beſt to let it alone, accounting it as an imperfect <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> and that it will in time grow more cloſe: but if it be otherwiſe, you muſt then remove the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in order to the Cure.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sinus</hi> be in a place where it may conveniently be laid open with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dilatation, divide it with Knife or Sciſſors the whole length. If after laying it open the <hi>Sinus</hi> be not throughout callous, remove that which is, and heal it according to the common method of Ulcers. But if the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be ſo ſtreight and narrow, that you cannot lay it open, you muſt then dilate it with Tents of Sponge, Gentian, <hi>Ariſtolochia,</hi> Eldern-pith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> untill the <hi>Sinus</hi> be large enough for your purpoſe. And to further this work, it may be proper that you outwardly apply ſuch Medicaments as may by their emollient and digeſtive quality reſolve and diſſipate the Matter impacted in the Parts about it: and theſe are <hi>rad. althaeae, lilior. enulae cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. ſigill. Solomon. cucumer. agreſt. ſem. lini, foenugraec. medull. oſſium. ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ung. porcin. axung. human. anſeris, gallin. unguent. dialthaeae, gum. galban. Ammoniac.</hi> &amp;c. Of theſe you may make Fomentations, Cataplaſms, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots. You have alſo to this purpoſe <hi>empl. de ranis cum &amp; ſine Mercurio, empl. de mucilag. diachyl. cum gum.</hi> The <hi>Fiſtula</hi> thus diſpoſed for laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, you muſt conſider whether you may not remove the <hi>Callus</hi> by Cathae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks: to which purpoſe <hi>Celſus</hi> propoſeth <hi>lachr. papaver. Cadmia, atramentum ſutorium, aerugo, ſandarach. alum.</hi> We commonly uſe <hi>lap. cauſtic. Vigon. troch. de minio, arſenicum, ol. chalchanth.</hi> Or thus: ℞ <hi>cerae, reſinae, an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>ſublimat.</hi> ℈ ij. or more or leſſe; mix this upon the fire, and dip a Sponge in it, but not too hot, leſt you burn your Sponge: then preſſe it out, and cut it into ſuch a form as may ſerve your purpoſe. <hi>Guido</hi> commends <hi>aq. fortis</hi> as moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for deſtroying the <hi>Callus</hi> of all theſe <hi>Fiſtula's.</hi> But if you had rather have an Injection, you may make this or ſuch like: ℞ <hi>unguent.

After the application of theſe ſtronger Medicaments, you muſt by Lenients mitigate the Pain, and defend the Part from Defluxions, which for the moſt part attend ſuch Eſcaroticks. Theſe are, Decoctions of <hi>fol. malvae, biſmalvae, violar. verbaſc. hyoſcyam. ſem. cydonior. hord.</hi> or <hi>ol. vitell. ovor. butyrum, axung. porcin. unguent. baſilic. cum ol. lilior. dialthaea,</hi> &amp;c. And apply over them Refrigerants; as <hi>empl. è bolo, oxelaeum, diapalm. cum ſuccis;</hi> or ſome of the Defenſatives mentioned in this Treatiſe. When the Inflammation is repelled, and the Sloughs caſt off, you may deterge with this: ℞ <hi>terebinth. in aq. vitae lot.</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſucc. apii, cynogloſſ. an.</hi>

But if the <hi>Fiſtula</hi> be near or over ſome noble Part, or if there be Nerve, Tendon or Artery near,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95669:238"/>or if it be deep in the great Bones or in the Joynts, where you may not ſafely proceed by actuall or potentiall Cautery, and it will not yield to milder Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments; you ſhall doe better to palliate it by ſome Waters and Unguents, which may diſpoſe the Part to quiet, purging the Patient ſometimes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the univerſall Regiment in Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>AN Officer of the <hi>King</hi>'s Army laboured long of a <hi>Fiſtula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſervat. of a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Os tibiae.</hi>
                        </note> occaſioned by a Gun-ſhot Wound in the upper part of the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> near the Knee, where it had formerly been ſhattered, many fragments of Bones caſting out at times. He had been ſometime my Patient in <hi>France;</hi> but here I finiſht what I there attempted, and had not time to doe. After generall Evacuation, I applied a Cauſtick the whole length of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> whereby I took off that <hi>Callus,</hi> gave vent to the diſcharge of that foetid <hi>Ichor</hi> made in the Ulcer, and took out ſeverall pieces of the rotten Bone which were ſhut in there. That done I ſcraped away the remaining Rottenneſſe, and dreſt the Bone with Catagmatick powders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which means after ſome time a <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt forth, and united with the neighbouring Fleſh, which incarned with the Lips, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cicatrized by the common Epuloticks.</p>
                     <p>It often happeneth, that in the time of the Exfoliation of carious Bones, as in Gun-ſhot Wounds and old Ulcers, while we are attending Exfoliation, the Lips grow callous, ſo that the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> is deep, and the Lips lie at ſome diſtance. In which caſe heretofore I have taken much pains to ſmooth them: but have ſince by experience found, that in time thoſe Lips ſink of themſelves, and as the <hi>Callus</hi> riſeth up to them the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> becometh firm and ſeemly, without giving the Patient that trouble of removing them by Cautery or Knife.</p>

                     <p>A Bone is a ſimilar Part of the Body, and the hardeſt and drieſt of all.<note place="margin">The Office and Uſe of Bones.</note> The generall Uſe of which is, <hi>Stabilimentum ac fundamentum reliquis omnibus Partibus largiri,</hi> to be a firm Prop and Foundation, upon the ſtrength whereof all the reſt of the Parts are built. The whole <hi>Sceleton</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered joyntly, may be looked upon as performing that office to the Little world, that <hi>Atlas</hi> hath been fabulouſly reported to doe to the Great one: it bears the whole bulk of it, and ſuſtains it in all its motions; none of which could be performed, if either the Bones were not, or not ſo articulated and joynted as upon defection they appear to be. <hi>Nam ſi oſſa abeſſent, non flecte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus manus, non nervos &amp; fibras.</hi> Nay, if the leaſt Bone be but a little mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the uſe of the Part is hindred. But they are not onely <hi>Fulcimenta,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu partium, ſed etiam Defenſio,</hi> but alſo a Defence. The <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, veluti Galea,</hi> as a Helmet defends the Brain from externall injuries. So <hi>Pectus Oſſibus clauditur;</hi> the Heart, Lungs, and great Veſſells of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> are guarded by a Wall of Ribs. The <hi>Spina</hi> is a Bulwark to the Marrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it: and ſuch a defence is the <hi>Os pubis</hi> and the <hi>Os coxae</hi> and <hi>Ileon</hi> to the Womb and Bladder. Others otherwiſe ſerve the uſes of Nature. As the three little Bones <hi>in meatu Auditorio,</hi> by firming the <hi>Tympanum,</hi> are a great help to the Hearing: the <hi>Os hyoïdes</hi> aſſiſteth the ſwallowing, by managing the Root of the tongue and the <hi>Epiglottis:</hi> the <hi>Rotula</hi> ſerves the motions of the Knee: and the Teeth prepare the Meat by Maſtication. Not a Bone but hath its particular end ſet out. There was a reaſon of the Temper, of the Magnitude, of the Number, of the Subſtance, of the Situation, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of them; the wiſe <hi>Creatour</hi> as much ſhunning ſuperfluity as deficiency. Indeed, the whole Fabrick is ſo full of Excellency, that it would take up much time to expreſſe it. But that is not my buſineſſe. The Subject I have undertaken to treat of is their Misfortune: and that is twofold; to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95669:241"/>be fractured, and diſlocated. That of Fractures I have propoſed for the firſt part of my preſent Diſcourſe; and that onely in generall, it being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for my deſign.</p>
                     <p>To proceed methodically,<note place="margin">Definitions of Fractures.</note> I ſhall begin with their <hi>Definition</hi> of a Fracture, who, according to <hi>Galen de Methodo medendi,</hi> make it to be <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitionis ſive continuitatis ſolutio quaecunque in oſſe.</hi> But this being too generall, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in all Carioſity and Ulcers of the Bones, which hardly belong to this Head of Chirurgery, the Moderns have more cloſely defined it to be, <hi>Oſſis diviſio ſeu ruptura à cauſa violenter irruente.</hi> But this likewiſe ſeems to me to be liable to many Exceptions. I ſhall name onely this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Cut made into a Bone by a Sword or a ſharp Inſtrument ſeems to be rather a Wound, then a Fracture. And for this reaſon <hi>Guido de Cauliaco</hi> makes it to be <hi>continuitatis ſolutio in oſſe non à re qualibet facta, ſed ab ea quae contundit.</hi> But I muſt ſtill beg pardon, if I be not yet ſatisfied with this Deſcription, becauſe it leaves out all ſuch Fractures as are made by any accidental bowing of a Bone, either in a Wrench, or any other caſe where, without any Blow or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion of Parts, the Bone ſnaps in ſunder, and then wounds the neighbouring Muſcles, even to the thruſting of it ſelf very often quite through the Skin. Theſe are (caſes of Battel excepted) the moſt frequent of all Fractures; yet not without ſome violence to be reduced to any of theſe latter Definitions. I ſhall therefore chuſe to define a Fracture in the following words;<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Fractures.</note> It is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity in a Bone, ſuddenly made, either by Contuſion or Flexure. By Contuſion I mean, either a Blow by a blunt Inſtrument, or a Preſſure by a great Weight; either of which uſually bruiſeth the Fleſh about the Bone, as well as the Bone it ſelf. In Contrafiſſures indeed the Bruiſe is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Fracture, but in the place where the Blow is given. In Flexure there is ſeldome any Bruiſe, but what is made by the edges of the Bone it ſelf after it is ſnapped in ſunder. All other Fractures are reducible to theſe.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> it was commonly known by the name of <hi>Catagma.</hi> I purpoſe not to trouble you with the nice Diſtinctions in Fractures, nor yet with their various Names. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>de Method. medendi</hi> complains thus in his time: <hi>Non deſunt ex Medicis junioribus, qui ambitioſe omnes Fracturarum differentias propriis nominibus interpretantur;</hi> There want not (ſaith he) young Phyſicians who affect to give proper names to all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kinds of Fractures: <hi>At non Hippocrates hujus fuit ſententiae;</hi> nor ſhall I ſpend my time ſo, but, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> do take the <hi>Difference</hi> in Fractures to ariſe,<note place="margin">Differences.</note> 1. <hi>à figura,</hi> 2. <hi>à magnitudine,</hi> 3. <hi>ab oſſium fractorum varietate.</hi> Firſt, from their Figure: and that is either right, <hi>quae fit per longitudinem;</hi> or tranſverſe, <hi>per latitudinem;</hi> or oblique, which is as it were compounded out of the two former. Secondly, <hi>à magnitudine,</hi> according as the Fracture is greater, or leſs. The third Difference is, <hi>ab oſſibus ipſis,</hi> that is, from the Bones themſelves that are broken, whether it be the Arm, Leg, Ribs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Fractures internall there are none,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> unleſs they proceed <hi>ab humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus corporis erodentibus;</hi> and of that ſort you may read many in <hi>Schenckius, Fabr. Hildanus,</hi> and others. I my ſelf have ſeen ſome, and lately. But theſe, being from Eroſion, are rather to be called Ulcers with <hi>Caries,</hi> and therefore more fit to be diſcourſt of amongſt Ulcers of that kind, to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>Of Cauſes externall there are many; as the too violent Aſſaults or Stroaks of all externall things, which may bruiſe, break, ſhatter, or bend. In this number of Cauſes may alſo be reckoned Falls from on high, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of a Fracture without a Wound are for the moſt part very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.<note place="margin">Signs.</note>
                        <pb n="465" facs="tcp:95669:241"/>The firſt and moſt certain is, when in our handling the Part we feel the pieces of Bones ſevered aſunder, and hear them crackle. Secondly, the Impotency of the Member. Thirdly, vehement Pain. Fourthly, a Diſtortion of the Part. It may alſo be diſcovered by comparing the one Member with the other; the fractured being the ſhorter. But if there be a Wound joined to the Fracture, then if the Bones thruſt themſelves not forth, yet you may eaſily know the Member to be fractured, if you ſearch with your finger or Probe. There is alſo a Curvedneſſe, which may be reduced to a Fracture. I have ſeen it in Children often, as in <hi>D. C</hi>'s little Daughter in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s Son in <hi>Black-friers,</hi> and others. It is as it were when you break a green Stick; it breaks, but ſeparates not: ſo is cured by a due Extenſion, with little Trouble to the Chirurgeon, or Pain to the Patient af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Extenſion is made.</p>
                     <p>If the Fracture be <hi>ſecundum longitudinem,</hi> it will appear firſt by the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thickneſſe of the Member, then by the Pain and Inequality of the Part.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> or Preſage,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> a Fracture of the Bones cannot be without danger: for of neceſſity the Solution of continuity muſt be great. If a Wound be made in a Fleſhy part, it is then proportionable to the Weapon that made it, <hi>&amp; non ultra:</hi> but if the Bone be broken, <hi>propter rigiditatem &amp; continuitatem non poteſt frangi, niſi totum frangatur.</hi> The Fracture is more dangerous in a great Bone then in a ſmall; and the greater, if both the Bones be broken, as the two Focills in the Leg, or if it be the Arm, where the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> are: yet if it happen in the middle of the Bones, it is the leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Thoſe in or near the Joynt are more painfull, and difficultly cured: and if any Shivers preſſe upon the Nervous parts, ill Accidents commonly follow; but of all the Fractures that with a Wound is moſt dangerous.</p>
                     <p>As to the time of <hi>Cure,</hi> the leſſer Bones are perfected in fourteen, eighteen,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> or twenty five days, the bigger in fourty or fifty, according to <hi>Guido.</hi> Yet let me adviſe you not to be too haſty in taking the Patients out of their Beds; for in ſome Bodies the generation of <hi>Callus</hi> is very ſlow, and a new Diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may happen, and ill Accidents follow. I have been called into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation upon ſuch an Accident, the Patient did recover, but by lying very long within doors contracted ſuch an ill Habit of body, as was not got off in a long while after.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of Fractures Unition is required: but that cannot be made, unleſſe Pain and Inflammation be prevented. For a Fracture of the Bones is not made without an internall wounding of the <hi>Perioſteum</hi> and Parts next to it, whence grievous Pain ariſes, which ſtirs up Defluxion, and is attended often with great Inflammation; and from the weakneſſe of the Member many Excrements are made and received, which it is neither capable to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilate, nor yet expell. And the miſchief is ſo much the greater, by how much the Bones lie deeper under the Muſcles, where they cannot be ſet, by reaſon of the great quantity of Fleſh interpoſing between them and the hand of the Artiſt. The Intention purſued in this caſe is the Union of Bones, as I have already ſaid; which is not performed by the firſt Intention, unleſſe it be in little Children, but by the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> an intervening of <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Method I thereto propoſe is, firſt, to joyn the fractured Parts together;<note place="margin">Intentions of Cure.</note> ſecondly, to keep them ſo joyned: thirdly, to preſerve the Tone of the Part; fourthly, to generate <hi>Callus;</hi> fifthly, to correct Accidents.</p>
                     <p>That the Parts may be rightly joyned together, there is need of Extenſion,<note place="margin">1. Intention.</note> and Coaptation. For in Fractures, eſpecially tranſverſe ones, the Bones
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95669:242"/>are commonly diſtorted, the rectitude of the Member loſt, ſome Parts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, and others hollow, the fractured Bones lying one upon another; and ſo the Member is made ſhort: <hi>&amp; quia muſculi perpetuò membra trahunt verſus ſuum principium;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Extenſion.</note> therefore Extenſion is neceſſary, that the Parts which are indirect may be brought right, and the Parts that ſtick out may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their Cavities. And although ſometimes the Member ſeemeth not to be ſhort, as if it conſiſts of two Bones, and one broken, or that the fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Bones do not lie one over another; nevertheleſſe you ought to make due Extenſion in all Fractures, becauſe the Bones never lie exactly equal, and moſt frequently they ride one over another. The want of which Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is one reaſon why the fractured Thigh-bones happen to be ſo often ſhorter then they ſhould be, as <hi>Celſus</hi> hath it in theſe words; <hi>Si femur per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractum fuerit, breve erit;</hi> his reaſon is, <hi>quia nunquam in antiquum ſtatum revertitur.</hi> And I find in <hi>Galen,</hi> that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies the ſame of the Leg and Arm; and withall tells us, it is ſo, <hi>niſi ante confirmationem extenſio debita abhibeatur, &amp; commodâ deligatione oſſium coaptatio ſervetur.</hi> By which you may obſerve, the fault is want of good Extenſion, and keeping the Part in its right ſeat: for unleſſe that be done, you ſhall hazzard the ſtarting again of the Bones, and thereby their fractured ends may happen to be broken off by mutuall Attrition in the act of joyning together: and if thoſe pieces do chance to fall in between the main Bones, they will then hinder their uniting: and if thoſe Shivers ſlide outwardly towards the Membranes, they will cauſe extreme Pain. This inconvenience is therefore to be ſhunned by the help of Extenſion. But again in Extenſion there muſt be obſerved a mean, as <hi>Vigo</hi> notes: <hi>Ad magnam quidem Extenſionem futurus Spaſmus valde ſuſpectus eſt.</hi> Yea ſometimes the very Muſcles are torn aſunder, as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us: and <hi>Albucaſius</hi> cries out, <hi>Cave Extenſionem vehementem &amp; Compreſſionem for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſicut faciunt multi ſtolidorum: multoties enim faciunt Apoſtema calidum &amp; contractionem in membro.</hi> By which it ſeems in his time there were ſuch people, who thereby drew ſad Accidents, as Convulſions and Inflammations, upon their Patients. But if the Extenſion be leſs then it ſhould, then, as I ſaid before, the ends of the Bones rub one againſt another, and are broken, or not ſeated in their proper place. Therefore the bigger Bones having large Muſcles, which draw the Member forcibly to their Originall, do require the ſtronger Extenſion; and ſuch are thoſe of the Thighs, Legs and Arms. And if both the Focills of the Arm be broken, the <hi>Radius</hi> requires the more Extenſion, becauſe it hath no Muſcles to draw it upwards, its motion being onely <hi>ſecundùm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; ſupinum.</hi> In Extenſion it behoves us to obſerve <hi>debitam figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem,</hi> that the Member be extended <hi>in ea figura quae minimum facit dolorem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Galen:</hi> which is done, if the Fibres of the Muſcles be ſtretcht according to their rectitude. Children, and ſuch as are of a ſoft Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, do beſt ſuffer Extenſion: elderly and dry Bodies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>In the next place is to be conſidered the moſt reaſonable time wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Fractures. And herein we all agree, the ſooner the better, and that to avoid Inflammation; and according to <hi>Celſus, Si in primis diebus non reſtauratur, inflammatio oritur,</hi> &amp;c. If at the firſt or ſecond day the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be not reduced, it is in danger of Inflammation and Mortification: for indeed after the ſecond day, it is ſuppoſed the Fracture is accompanied with great Defluxion, and ſo yields not to Extenſion without hazzard of drawing ſuch ill Accidents upon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Expoſition upon <hi>Hippocrates De Capitis vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> and by his authority, tells us what we ſhall doe in ſuch a caſe. <hi>Si os
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:95669:242"/>non fuerit in ſuo loco,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ideo ad ſeptimam, qui eſt primus terminus Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationis, vel uſque ad nonam, qui eſt ſecundus, debemus bene advertere: &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet impedire inflammationem.</hi> If the Bone was not reſtored before the time of Inflammation, then we ought to attend till the ſeventh day, which is the firſt period of Inflammation, or untill the ninth day, which is the ſecond period: and all this time we ought to reſtrain the Defluxion, <hi>vel per lenitionem doloris, vel expreſſionem &amp; deligationem loci. Lenimus autem medicamentis oleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, quae habent vim refrigerandi, vel per deligationem pluribus faſciis;</hi> either by lenient Medicines, or by Deligation. We lenifie with ſoft cooling Oils: we make our Deligation or Bandage by many turns of the Rowlers. Theſe are to be done untill the ſeventh or ninth day. Inflammation abating gives you opportunity for reducing the Fracture.<note place="margin">Inſtruments of extenſion.</note> The Inſtruments for Extenſion are threefold. Firſt, the Chirurgeon's Hand, for gentle Extenſion: and let him place his Hand near the Fracture; otherwiſe he ſhall hurt the ſound Part by too much Compreſſion, and not avail himſelf much in his Extenſion. Secondly, for the middle Extenſion there are <hi>Funes</hi> and <hi>Habenae,</hi> a ſort of Bandage fit to pluck at in order to Extenſion. Thirdly, there are <hi>Organa</hi> and <hi>Machinamenta,</hi> Engines uſed often by us, but invented by the Ancients: and they are for the moſt ſtrong Extenſion. But before you make your Extenſion, conſider whether the Member be not fractured in more places then one. An old Gentleman came out of the Countrey, and by a Fall going down <hi>Ludgate-hill</hi> brake his right Arm a little above the Wriſt tranſverſe; and near the bending of the Arm was a ſecond Fracture oblique. This dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fracture hath happened to others in the Leg. It requires your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, leſt the one eſcape your ſight, and the Member be left deformed, and weakned in its action.</p>
                     <p>The Extenſion made, the Extenders are to be looſened gently,<note place="margin">Coaptation.</note> and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratour muſt with his hand endeavour as gently to preſſe down the ends of the Bones, and joyn them ſmooth and even together. And if there be any little Shiver that will not be placed even with its fellows, cut upon it, and take it out. You ſhall know the perfect Coaptation of Parts by theſe Signs.<note place="margin">Signs of good Coap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Firſt, if the fractured Member anſwer to the ſound; ſecondly, if by your handling of it you feel no Inequality; and thirdly, if Pain be abated.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention in curing of Fractures is,<note place="margin">2. Intention.</note> that the Parts brought together may ſo be preſerved: and that is performed by Bandage, which ought to be ſo made, as not onely to keep the Parts ſo joyned together, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from Inflammation. And to this purpoſe I commend to you that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> from my own practice. It conſiſts of three Rowlers made of linen Cloath, not too courſe, leſt thereby it ſhould offend the fractured Member; nor yet too ſoft and fine, leſt it break.</p>
                     <p>With the firſt Rowler you are to begin upon the Fracture,<note place="margin">1. Rowler.</note> and take three Turns there. Then rowl upward to the ſound part, and ſo a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and there end this Rowler. It will keep the Fracture a little ſteady, untill the other Bandage be made, and reſtrain the influx of Humours which might cauſe Inflammation.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Rowler ought to be as long again as the firſt,<note place="margin">2. Rowler.</note> and muſt be rowled contrary to the firſt; as for inſtance, if the firſt was made to the right hand, this muſt be turned to the left: ſo that if the Muſcles by the firſt Bandage were wreathed too much on one ſide, they now may be reſtored again to the other. This ſecond Rowler muſt begin upon the Fracture, and after a Turn or two there, muſt be carried downwards, that ſo you may preſſe the influx of Humours from the fractured part. And ſo having made three or four Turns downwards upon the ſound part, you may rowl upwards
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:95669:243"/>again by the Fracture, and making a Circumvolution upon the Fracture it ſelf, paſſe upwards, untill you come to the end of the firſt Rowler. And there <hi>Hippocrates</hi> terminates this ſecond Bandage, becauſe there is fear of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of Humours <hi>à parte ſuperiori:</hi> and theſe two Bandages do more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Part from Inflammation, then ſtrengthen the Fracture. But they being made,<note place="margin">Splenia.</note> 
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> puts over them Compreſſes of linen Cloath three or four times doubled, of ſuch length as to reach over the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but ſo narrow, as that five or ſix might be placed round about the Fracture, the diſtance of a finger one from another. Theſe are to be ſpred with a little Cerote, onely to make them ſtick. They are called <hi>Plagulae</hi> and <hi>Splenia</hi> from their figure, and do ſupply the defect of agglutinative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, and leſſen the Pain, by hindering the Compreſſion of the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                     <p>The third Rowler of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> faſtens the ſaid Compreſſes;<note place="margin">3. Rowler.</note> and its firſt Turn is made upon the Fracture, the one head being carried upwards, and the other downwards. And you are to take notice, that the Bandages are to be drawn more ſtreight upon the fractured Parts then elſewhere, that the ſaid Parts being more weak, may be kept from Defluxions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celſus</hi> in his eighth Book,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Celſus</hi>'s way of Rowling.</note> and tenth Chapter, propoſes another way of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Firſt, he dipt a Cloath in Red wine and Oil, and applied it over and about the Fracture, and over that he brought ſix Rowlers, his two firſt being thoſe of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and ſo he rowled them; then he uſed a broad double li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Cloath, ſpred with Cerote, to keep them cloſe down. And his reaſon is, becauſe the fractured Bone hath always a propenſity that way whither it tended when fractured; therefore, ſaith he, you are always to put a Compreſſe of linen Cloath, dipt in Wine and Oil, <hi>ei parti quae contraria eſt parti in quam membrum inclinat.</hi> And over this he brings the four remaining Rowlers; ſo as the following Rowler be rowled contrary to the former, and the third end <hi>in inferiori parte,</hi> in the lower part, <hi>reliquae omnes in ſuperiori terminum habeant,</hi> all the reſt end above.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Bandages of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> men of the greateſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Chirurgery, and are followed almoſt by all that have writ ſince, and are of excellent uſe in Fractures in and near the Joynts, where there is fear of Inflammation. But then in your Binding you muſt obſerve ſuch a mean as confiſts with the eaſe of the Member bound.<note place="margin">Signs of good Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> A ſmall and lax Tumour appearing at the extremity of the Member a day after, is a ſign of good Bandage; but if there appear no Tumour, or if the Swelling be great and hard, then the Bandage is naught; the firſt ſhewing the Bandage not to be ſtreight enough, and the laſt too ſtreight. Therefore you ſhould often viſit your Patient, to inform your ſelf how the Bandage is.</p>
                     <p>But if no Accident happen,<note place="margin">When to looſen Bandage.</note> you ſhall not unbind the Fracture untill the ſeventh day: and then, if all be well, the Bandage will begin to ſlacken of it ſelf; and if it be not well, you may then ſee your errour, and timely help it. And that is one reaſon, why Fractures ſhould be opened about that time. Another may be, for that often in Fractures there is an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Itching, through the detention of Humours, which are made ſharp by Deligation, (Perſpiration being thereby hindred,) and that is wont to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in a moſt painfull Excoriation and inflamed Redneſſe. In which caſe you are to bath the affected Part with warm Water, that the Matter may be evaporated: and then the Member is to be bound up again. But here you are to put <hi>Ferulae</hi> or Splints in ſtead of the <hi>Splenia</hi> or Compreſſes. Whereas in Fractures with great Contuſion, or in and near the Joints, I have continued the uſe of Compreſſes wet in Whites of eggs during the whole Cure with
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95669:243"/>good ſucceſſe. And lately a Youth about ten years of age,<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> labouring under a carious Ulcer in his Foot, the laſt great Froſt brake his Thigh-bone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the Member. This Fracture was covered with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> and <hi>Splenia</hi> moiſtened <hi>in album. ovor.</hi> with Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is propoſed in this Treatiſe; by which the fractured Bones were kept even and cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with much eaſe to the Child, and agglutinated firmly by the <hi>Callus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening. Mr. <hi>Yowel,</hi> ſometimes a Servant of mine, ſet his Thigh-bone for me, I being at that preſent otherwiſe imployed.</p>
                     <p>But all the Ancients after the ſeventh day did uſe Splints; and ſo have I where they might ſafely be uſed: for they not onely keep the Member ſteady, but ſtraight. And of theſe ſome are made of Tin, others of Scabbard, Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and of Wood, ſowed up in linen Cloaths. Thoſe of Tin do very well, by reaſon of their lightneſſe. Thoſe of Scabbards are apt to bow, and ſo thoſe of the thickeſt Paſtboard, eſpecially if they chance to be wet. And thoſe of Wood are heavy, and apt to inflame the Member. Yet through the Artiſt's care they may be all uſed with good ſucceſſe, yea from the firſt day of the Fracture. As in the caſe of a Reverend Divine, who brake both the Focills of his left Leg within a few fingers breadth of the Ancle. This perſon laboured under an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> which grievouſly ſhook the fractured Member; wherefore I was neceſſitated to put on <hi>Ferulae</hi> the very firſt dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which I continued the uſe of during the whole time of his Cure. He lately told me, that he never felt the leaſt pain in that Leg ſince I took off the laſt Plaiſter, which is more then ten years ſince. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> uſed them not untill the ſeventh day. For before that day there was more need of hindring the Inflammation, then of ſtrengthening the Fracture; <hi>poſt ſeptimam contra,</hi> but afterward the contrary is required.</p>
                     <p>The third Intention in curing of Fractures is,<note place="margin">3. Intention.</note> in preſerving the Tone of the Part. <hi>Natura enim os unire nequit, niſi pars ſit ſana;</hi> Nature cannot knit the Bones while the Parts are under a Diſtemper: and that cannot preſently be removed. For though fractured Bones be very well ſet, yet there will remain ſome <hi>Cavernulae,</hi> which will be apt to fill with <hi>Sanies,</hi> which the Part through its weakneſſe can neither well aſſimilate nor expell, and ſo is like to be burthened with excrementitious Humours. Therefore Phlebotomy may be here of ſpecial uſe, and the keeping of the Belly ſoluble by Clyſters, or otherwiſe, and a ſlender Diet muſt be preſcribed. This is the work of the Phyſicians. But they not being always at hand, I thought fit to mention it, and ſo to proceed to our own work, in keeping up the Tone of the Part. And hereto we have need of ſuch Medicines <hi>quae materiam influxam deſiccant, &amp; inflammationem repellunt,</hi> which dry up Seroſities, and repell Inflammation. And theſe in a word are <hi>Aſtringentia,</hi> of which we have choice. <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> uſed Cerote, then Red wine: <hi>Celſus,</hi> as you have heard, uſed Oil of Myrtills and Roſes, Red wine, and Whites of eggs together: others again uſed Whites of eggs alone; and others added Oil of Myrtill, <hi>balauſt. roſ. rubr. ſang. dracon. bol. Armen.</hi> and with a little Wine made it up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a Liniment, and applied it upon Cloaths over the Fracture. By the uſe of this latter Medicament I cured a man whoſe Arm was ſoar bruiſed, and fractured in many pieces, by the fall of a piece of Cannon, which brake looſe in a Storm, while we were preparing to lay aboard our Enemy. Over this Reſtrictive I applied <hi>Splenia</hi> of double ſoft Linen with Bandage, as in Compound Fractures, and happily cured him. If the Inflammation be not great, I then take <hi>empl. diapalmae,</hi> and ſome of the forementioned Powders, with a little Oil of Myrtill and Vinegar, made up to the conſiſtence of an Emplaſter, which I ſpread upon Cloath pretty thick, and apply over the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:95669:244"/>Fracture. It not onely reſtrains the Defluxion, but ſtrengthens the Fracture. The Medicaments propoſed are all very good, and excellently preſerve the Tone of the Part, if they be proportioned according to the greatneſſe of the Malady.</p>
                     <p>There is yet farther requiſite to the performance of this Intention,<note place="margin">Poſition of the member.</note> a right Poſition of the Member: and that, according to <hi>Galen, debet eſſe mollis;</hi> the hurt Part ought to lie ſoft: for that hard lying preſſes upon the bruiſed Bones and Fleſh, and cauſes Pain and Inflammation. <hi>Debet eſſe aequalis, nè diſtorqueat;</hi> It muſt lie ſmooth or equall, becauſe an uneven placing diſtorts or draws awry the Part. <hi>Surſum verſus, nè humores deſcendant;</hi> It ſhould lie ſomewhat high, leſt a painfull Defluxion fall upon it. <hi>Oportet congruam membri figurationem conſiderare:</hi> It behoves, ſaith <hi>Hildanus,</hi> to conſider the convenient figure of the Member, that the Muſcles be kept in their right Site, which is moſt free from Pain. <hi>Haec autem eſt figura media;</hi> which if it be not obſerved, <hi>exiguo poſt tempore membrum dolere ſolet.</hi> What thoſe Pains are, you may poſſibly gueſſe, but no tongue can expreſſe. Therefore you ought to handle the Member very tenderly; and if the Fracture be made <hi>in cubito,</hi> place it in a Caſe made of Paſtboard, with a ſoft Pillow under it, and bring it up to the Breaſt with a fine Towell, or the like. But if it be the Leg that is fractured, we then place it in a Bed, or in a Cradle, or upon a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low quilted in the midſt with Junks to ſupport it; having a ſpeciall care that the Hollow of the Ham and Heel be filled up, leſt the weight of the Foot hurt the Heel, from whence grievous Pain doth enſue, and ſad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may follow, as at large you may reade in <hi>Fabr. Hildanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth Intention is,<note place="margin">4. Intention.</note> 
                        <hi>Callum generare,</hi> to make <hi>Callus;</hi> which is to be endeavoured after the fear of Inflammation is over, <hi>quia natura partis laeſa non poteſt Callum generare;</hi> and that ceaſeth <hi>circa diem ſeptimam,</hi> about the ſeventh day, ſooner or later. And if after that time the Fracture be to be ſet, <hi>poſſunt diverſa &amp; mala accidentia generari,</hi> ſaith <hi>Vigo.</hi> Yet after the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Fracture I have ſet the Thigh-bone, and cured the Patient, without any ill Accidents: he is yet living to teſtifie it.</p>
                     <p>How the <hi>Callus</hi> is made, you may reade at large in <hi>Fallopius,</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> And though it be not Bone, it is ſo hard, ſaith he, that if the Member hap again to be broke, <hi>potiùs in alia parte frangitur, quàm ubi Callus eſt genitus,</hi> it breaks anywhere rather then in the <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things are therefore required: firſt, that it be ſupplied with fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſecondly, that that matter be not waſhed from the edges of the fractured Bones, <hi>aut foras evocetur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Galen.</hi> As for the matter to make <hi>Callus,</hi> moſt Authours do agree,<note place="margin">Diet for the ingendring of <hi>Callus.</hi>
                        </note> that there be a greater liberty in Diet. <hi>At quo tempore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Galen</hi>) <hi>Callus gignitur, nutriendum corpus eſt cibis boni ſucci, &amp; qui multùm nutriant.</hi> And that muſt be viſcous: his reaſon is, <hi>quia oſſis alimentum craſſum.</hi> And for that reaſon Authours commend at this time Offall of Fleſh, and Broths of Kid and Veal, and the like, boiled with Rice or Wheat. They alſo allow ſweet Wines. But this liberty in Diet I think is better forborn, for thereby we often ſee great Obſtructions ariſe, eſpecially there where our Patients are inclinable to feed plentifully. Therefore in ſuch Fractures where the Patient is conſtrained to keep his Bed, I propoſe a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diet, and of ſuch things as are of eaſie Digeſtion. For without that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſurely we cannot fail to compleat our Cure; the Bones having naturally a Porineſſe in them, in which is always contained a matter fit for their Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and <hi>ex illo ipſo nutrimento in fracturis generatur Callus,</hi> of that Nouriſhment <hi>Callus</hi> is made. So if we be carefull to prevent Inflammation, and the like Miſchiefs, which diſturb Nature in her actions, and apply ſuch Remedies as may dry the proper Nouriſhment into <hi>Callus,</hi> we ſhall not
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95669:244"/>fail then of our deſire: and thoſe remedies, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> ought to be Emplaſtick and moderately hot. For, ſaith he, <hi>ea Callos tum promovent, tum augent: quae digerendi vim obtinent, ea magnos jam Callos diminuunt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves us with care to fit our Medicines to the Age and Conſtitution of our Patients. For thoſe which are proper for Men of ripe age, if applied to Children and tender Bodies, would ſo dry the <hi>Callus,</hi> that they would quite diminiſh it, and fruſtrate our Cure. In Children <hi>Albucaſius</hi> commends to us the application of Whites of eggs alone, or with a little <hi>farina volatilis:</hi> in thoſe of more years, <hi>pulv. myrrhae, aloes, acaciae, gum. tragacanth. thus, lab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Emplaſtrum ſtict. Paracelſ. diapalm. oxycroceum,</hi> ſeverally or mixt, are proper. But this latter <hi>Vigo</hi> is very angry with, and ſays it is a Diabolicall Emplaſter, too hot for the Summer, and not very proper for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Vigo</hi>'s <hi>emplaſtr. ad oſſium fracturas</hi> is excellent; and ſo is our <hi>Catag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticum</hi> in the <hi>London Diſpenſatory.</hi> As to internall Medicines, there are many; but I ſhall onely recommend to you <hi>oſteocolla,</hi> and that by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Fabr. Hildanus,</hi> who often experienced it. The Doſe was <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. <hi>in aq. rad. ſymphyti:</hi> and with this ſo given he cured a compound Fracture in one above ſixty years of age. <hi>At in juvenibus &amp; ſucculentis non putat convenire oſteocollam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have propoſed fit materialls for the generation of <hi>Callus:</hi> now leſt that the matter of which it is to be generated ſhould be hindred from thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting forth, it behoveth you to alter the Bandage, the Member not requiring to be rowled now ſo ſtreight; by which means the nutritious Juices will have liberty to flow in, and there by graduall Digeſtion to thicken into a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> In taking off your Dreſſings, you are to conſider whether the <hi>Callus</hi> genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted be ſuch as is required. how the fault of the <hi>Callus</hi> is to be remedied, if it be greater or leſſe then it ſhould be, you ſhall hear preſently.</p>
                     <p>If the Fractures be ſimple, whether tranſverſe or <hi>ſecundum longitudinein,</hi> they are cured by the ſame methods; onely theſe latter require a more ſtrict Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, otherwiſe the Bones will be apt to riſe and make a gibbous Member.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Intention is,<note place="margin">5. Intention.</note> the correcting of thoſe Accidents which happening in Fractures retard their Cure: and they are many; as Pain, Inflammation, Apoſtemation, Gangrene, Itching, Excoriation, <hi>Callus</hi> more or leſſe then ſhould be, Weakneſs of the Member, and depraved Figure. If Pain invade the place, then Lenients are proper, and ſuch Remedies as reſtrain Defluxion, and hinder Inflammation; of which ſort I have mentioned ſome, and for more variety refer you to thoſe which are ſet down in the Chapter of <hi>Phlegmon.</hi> If Gangrene appear, ſlacken your Bandage, and foment the Part with a <hi>Lixivium</hi> in which have been boiled <hi>ſcordium, abſinth. centaur.</hi> and the like. You may alſo apply over all a Cataplaſm of Barley-meal, Lupines, with the addition of ſuch Ingredients as have been preſcribed in the Chapter of <hi>Gangrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</hi> But if Itching affect the Part, then foment it with warm Water, which will give a breathing to it by the Pores; or with Salt-water, <hi>quae propter ſalem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgat, &amp; poros aperit.</hi> The Itching neglected is wont to terminate <hi>in exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riationem doloroſam,</hi> in a very painfull Excoriation, <hi>cui occurrendum eſt exſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantibus &amp; refrigerantibus;</hi> ſuch are <hi>unguent. alb. camph. nutritum, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Callus,</hi> it is ſometimes juſt, ſometimes greater or leſſer then it ought.<note place="margin">To leſſen <hi>Callus.</hi>
                        </note> If it be too great, you will perceive it by its bunching out; as alſo it will be painfull to the touch or preſſure; and beſides it renders the Part unapt for motion. In this caſe abate the Patient's Diet, make your Bandage more ſtrict, and foment with Diſcutients, alſo apply <hi>empl. de cicuta, de ranis cum Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curio,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:95669:245"/>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Callus</hi> bel eſs then fit,<note place="margin">To encreaſe <hi>Callus.</hi>
                        </note> the ſigns are, <hi>quòd ad motum redditur debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> the Bone is weak, and if the Part be toucht you ſcarce feel the <hi>Callus.</hi> And this was thought by the Ancients to proceed from ſlenderneſs of Diet, or that it was not enough incraſſating. But I think it rather proceeds from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Applications, or too ſtreight Bandage. Yet if the Patient be in years, and of a ſpare Body, you may both increaſe and incraſſate his Diet: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſlacken your Bandage, and invite forth the Humours by warm Water, not too hot, <hi>donec pars rubeſcat, &amp; in tumorem attollatur,</hi> untill the fractured Parts a little ſwell; <hi>tunc enim defiſtendum.</hi> But if the Member be extenuated, it is either from the too ſtreight Bandage, or over-much bathing with warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: therefore you muſt now bath with freſh Broths, and other good Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Alſo a Pitch-plaiſter applied, and preſently pulled off again, will by its adheſion to the Hair and Skin cauſe Pain, and likewiſe an attraction of Aliment to the Part, and ſo the Member may be nouriſhed.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes alſo after the Fracture is cured, the Member is found to be of a depraved Figure, by reaſon the Bones were not well ſet, or through ill Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or ſome inordinate motion, <hi>aut propter inſcitiam Chirurgi.</hi> To reſolve this <hi>Callus,</hi> ſome Authours have adventured to preſcribe ſundry Medicaments; but they have hitherto proved unſucceſsful. Yet if it be true what a Chirurgeon lately affirmed of <hi>empl. de minio,</hi> the work would be very facil. But <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Fabr. ab Aquapend.</hi> after the preſcribing various Remedies conclude at laſt thus: If the Patient be young and luſty, and the <hi>Callus</hi> but ſix months old, there is yet one refuge, that is, <hi>fracturam de novo rumpere:</hi> and in order thereunto, you are to foment the Part with Decoctions <hi>ex althaea, rad. lilior. fol. malvar. tapſ. barbat. cicuta,</hi> &amp;c. and then <hi>rurſus os frangitur manibus vel digitis, impellendo ſeu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primendo.</hi> But if the <hi>Callus</hi> be ſo hard that it yields not to your hands, then ſays <hi>Fab. ab Aquapend. frango eum inſtrumento attrahente in diverſas partes.</hi> But this, <hi>Albucaſius,</hi> a Chirurgeon as hold as any, and one that had ſeen the effects of ſuch raſh undertakings, utterly condemns, ſaying, it is <hi>operatio valde vitupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis, perducens ad mortem:</hi> therefore he adviſeth the Patient not to give ear to ſuch vain people, but rather content himſelf with ſuch help as emollient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, Liniments, and Emplaſters may effect. Which in truth is ſafer, if you conſider, that after the <hi>Callus</hi> is ſo confirmed that it will not yield to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, then if you ſhould break it anew, or any other way ſeparate it; yet it would no more yield to a right Coaptation, then a Hair-lip or my two Fingers will to Agglutination without ſeparating the Calloſity; which is not poſſible to be done in Bones.</p>
                     <p>I could have here inſerted many Inſtances of my work in the Cure of the ſeverall Fractures of particular Parts: but it would ſignifie little more then I have already written, their Cure conſiſting in the very ſame Extenſion and Coaptation, and they being ſubject to no other Accidents then what I have ſet down: all which I have writ as plainly and feelingly, as if I had been performing the work in your preſence. Yet as a rarity I ſhall give you one Inſtance.</p>
                     <p>SOme years before the Fire,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Face.</note> I was ſent for to a poor Widow inhabiting near <hi>Bridewell,</hi> whoſe little Son, of about eight years of age, playing about the Wharf, was ſtruck by one of thoſe great Cart-horſes full in the Face, beating the <hi>Ethmoïdes</hi> quite in from the <hi>Os cribriforme,</hi> without any great Wound. The Boy lay for dead a while, and dozed longer. It appeared a ſtrange ſight at firſt to me, his Face being beaten in, and the lower Jaw ſtickling out: nor did I preſently know how to help him, or by what art to make my Extenſion. But after a while, he a little recovering his Senſes, was perſwaded to open his
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:95669:245"/>Mouth. And there I ſaw the <hi>Os palati</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> beaten ſo cloſe backwards, that it was not poſſible for me to get my finger behind, as I deſigned; and other way of Extenſion there was none. Upon which I preſently formed an Inſtrument bended up at one end, by which I got up behind the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula;</hi> then raiſing it a little upward, pulled it forward with the Bone into its former place very eaſily. But I no ſooner let go my Extender then the fractured body returned back again. I then contented my ſelf in dreſſing up the Face with a reſtrictive Cerote, to prevent the Influx of Humours, and let him bloud, and within a few hours after cauſed an Inſtrument to be made, whereby the great fractured body was more eaſily brought into its naturall place, and alſo kept there by the hand of the Child, his Mother and my Servants helping him ſome while: other way there was none. Thus by their and our care, the Tone of the Part was preſerved, and a <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt forth, which as it hardened, the Part grew ſtronger, and the Face was reſtored to a good ſhape, better then could have been hoped for from ſuch a Diſtortion in that place. The Patient is yet alive and well.</p>
                     <p>A Page attending a Noble Family, riding behind the Coach, fell down,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> bruiſed his Face, and broke his right Collar-bone. He was taken up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the next Pretender to Chirurgery, who ſeeing his Face much ſwelled, and his Noſe bloudy, concluded it fractured, and fill'd up his Noſtrills with Tents, binding them up with Plaiſters; and finding his lower Jaws ſtanding unequally with the upper, concluded them luxated, and that part of the <hi>Sternon</hi> under the Collar-bone was broken down. Things being thus repreſented, I was ſent to view this Youth: and pulling off the Plaiſter, and the Tents out of his Noſe, I ſaw nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wound nor Fracture. His Jaws did not anſwer equally to one another; but by his frequent motion and champing with them, it was evident they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luxated nor fractured. But by his Fall the Bones of his Face ſeemed to be preſſed inward, and the uppermoſt Jaws were cruſhed nearer one another then they ſhould: and this made the Inequality which our Chirurgeon thought a fault in the lower Jaws, and by his pulling them had like to have broken or diſlocated them. The next day he called in a Chirurgeon to juſtifie his proceedings. But there appearing nothing of Luxation or Fracture in the Jaws, we looked upon the <hi>Sternon,</hi> and found it well; but that Collar-bone was broken oblique, which we ſet and bound up, with reſolution not to open it till it ſhould be united. All things being in this hopefull condition, we adviſed him to keep his Bed, and left him to obſerve the Directions of his Phyſician, by whoſe preſcription a Clyſter was adminiſtred that evening, which he voided into a white earthen Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, which his Chirurgeon looking into call'd it bloud, and alarm'd his Friends. But a diſcreet perſon looking afterward upon it, concluded it onely the Clyſter tinctured with red Sugar, <hi>Hiera picra,</hi> &amp;c. I being ſoon after fetched, confirmed the ſame, and appeaſed that clamour. About the tenth day our Chirurgeon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to former order, undreſſed the fractured Clavicle: upon whoſe binding it too ſlack the Bone ſtarted, and from that time it grew painfull; ſo that he dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it again four or five days after: but the Pain increaſing the more, I was fetched, and upon opening ſaw one end of the Clavicle riding over the other, and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt the Skin. The <hi>Callus</hi> being confirmed, the Patient was removed from his Chirurgeon's houſe to his Mother's in the City, where being in great Pain, his Chirurgeon dreſſed him again; and the ſtreighter he made the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the greater was the Pain. He not imagining the cauſe, imputed the fault to the unrulineſs of the Patient, and declared that the Fracture was yet in the Bone, and that it was incapable of Cure. Upon which I was ſent for, and ſeeing the Pain to proceed from the end of the fractured Bone pricking in the Skin, and the more when it was bound, I cauſed half a Wallnut-ſhell to be plaiſtered over
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95669:246"/>it: and having thereby defended it from Preſſure, he made uſe of his Arm, and complained no more of Pain. I then deſigned to cut off that end of the Bone, if it again pained him: but from that time it continued eaſy, and he recovered the uſe of that Arm very well.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I done with that which concerns Simple Fractures.<note place="margin">Compound Fractures.</note> In a Fracture with a Wound, if neither the Bone be bare, nor yet prominent through the Skin, then you are by Extenſion to bring the fractured ends of the Bone toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as was propoſed in the firſt and ſecond Intentions of Simple Fractures. And the Lips of the Wound are likewiſe to be brought together by Suture, if it be any whit large, and not too much contuſed. Which manner of dreſſing is contrary to what is taught in Gun-ſhot Wounds with Fracture; the method being to be altered upon that occaſion for the reaſons there alleaged. Then endeavour, as in our third Intention, to keep the fractured and wounded Parts together by Dreſſings, which may as well mitigate the Pain, as keep off Apoſtemation, by repelling the Matter flowing to the Parts, and drying up that which already affecteth the Fracture and wound: <hi>qualia ſunt Aſtringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that is by Aſtringents; with which I have ſufficiently furniſhed you in the Diſcourſe of Simple Fractures <hi>Galen,</hi> by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends Cerote of Roſes. But if there be no Pain, you are to endeavour the ſtrengthening of the Fracture, and preventing Defluxions, by Cloaths ſpred with that Compoſition of aſtringent Powders, mixt with the Whites of eggs and Red wine, which is already propoſed. Then follows Deligation of the Part: and in this caſe Bandages are to be made of ſofter and broader Linen then we uſe in Fractures without a Wound, that they may comprehend both the Lips of the Wound, and keep them down, yet not hurt them by too hard Compreſſion. <hi>Minùs aſtringendae ſunt faſciae quàm ſi vulnus non adeſſet,</hi> ſays <hi>Celſus.</hi> And therefore it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> make ſo many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions; <hi>cùm melius ſit ſaepe circumire quàm aſtringere,</hi> ſaith <hi>Celſus</hi> again. The third day they looſen the Bandage: then <hi>ferulae vel non apponendae, nè vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus comprimant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Albucaſius;</hi> or if they be put on, <hi>ſuper vulnus apponi non debent.</hi> Rather in theſe Fractures do we uſe Deligation, <hi>pluribus faſciis,</hi> with many Rowlers, ſaith <hi>Albucaſius.</hi> And ſo all along he proceeds in his Diſcourſes of Fractures, as if he had been rather bred under <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Celſus,</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> then where he was. But in truth this way of Deligation is not onely very troubleſome to the Chirurgeon, to put on and off, but ſo very painful to the Patient, that it is almoſt impoſſible that he ſhould ever be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Fever, if his Wound be every day to be ſo rowled and unrowled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe Compound Fractures we chuſe rather to follow the method of ſome of the Moderns, who, in ſtead of theſe many long Rowlers, make choice of two or three ſhort Cloaths, folded three or four times double, to give them the more ſtrength. We alſo make them of ſuch breadth, as to encompaſs the Lips of the Wound and the fractured Parts; and of that length, as to come once about the Fracture, and ſo ſtitch together on the moſt convenient ſide. And under theſe may be placed Compreſſes of fine Tow, or double Cloaths; which will not onely keep the Lips of the Wound down, but fill up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, and further the expulſion of Matter. And ſo the Wound may be dreſt, and the fractured Member relieved at your pleaſure, without giving the Patient the pain to have the fractured Member removed, or your ſelf the trouble of rowling and unrowling ſo many long Rowlers as the Ancients propoſed. With this method I have cured Arms and Legs, ſo ſhattered by Splinters from Cannon-ſhot, and with ſuch loſs of Subſtance, that I even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of their Cure. But in ſome of theſe I have made uſe of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:95669:246"/>
                        <hi>Plagulae;</hi> and often, for the more ſtrengthening the ſhattered Member, have been glad to make uſe of ſome Splints from the firſt day; but ſo as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion was gentle and equall, and ſo placed that the Lips of the Wound might be kept even, and that the diſcharge of Matter was by them furthered. But if the Wound be tranſverſe, it then requires more caution, leſt the Matter ſhould at any time be preſt back into the Wound, and ſo not onely dilate it, but foul the Bones.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for a Fracture with a Wound where the Bones are not expoſed to the Air. But if the Bone be bare, and thruſt it ſelf out of the Wound, you ſhall endeavour preſently to reduce it; and after it is reſtored to its naturall place, let the Wound be ſtitcht and dreſt, as I propoſed to you even now in the Compound Fracture.</p>
                     <p>A Commander at Sea,<note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Leg.</note> valiantly fighting in the midſt of the Enemie's Fleet, had his Leg fractured by the fall of his Mizzen-top-maſt, it breaking his Leg tranſverſe near the Ancle, the edge of the Bond thruſting out through the Skin. He not ſuffering the Bone then preſently to be ſet while it was warm, afterwards, when it was ſwelled and ſtiff, it did not yield to Extenſion, but became painfull and inflamed. After ſome few days he was brought to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and I was ſent to him. He was of an ill Habit of body, ſubject to the Gout and Dyſenterie; and the Fracture being accompanied with great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion was not in a condition to admit of Extenſion. Therefore, according to <hi>Fallopius</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> before cited by me in this Treatiſe, I propoſed to his Chirurgeon to proceed by Lenients, to mitigate Pain, Inflammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by Bandage to hinder Defluxion. Which we did; and his Chirurgeon continued that method a few days, by which the Accidents were remitted. When we met again, finding the Patient in eaſe, we took off the Dreſſings, and agreed to make Extenſion, and reduce the Fracture. The Patient was of a dry tough Body, and the Member yielded difficultly to the Stretch: upon which conſideration we ſatisfied our ſelves with a moderate Extenſion, doubting that upon a more forcible one ill Accidents might follow, (as an Inflammation preſently did. (We dreſt it up as a compound Fracture: and after ſome days dreſſing a <hi>Callus</hi> thruſt forth, and united the Bones. That <hi>Callus</hi> being confirmed and dried, we haſten'd the Exfoliation of the foul Bone by a little <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> and <hi>pulv. myrrhae</hi> diſſolved in <hi>ſpir. vini,</hi> applied hot upon an armed Probe. Thus the Bone was exfoliated, and the Ulcer cured by the ordinary Intentions in ſuch caſes. Yet the inward leaning of the Bone conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a weakneſs in the Member a long time, as is uſuall where the Fracture hath not been timely or well reduced. To remedy this, I cauſed a Bar of Steel to be fixed in his Shoe with joints, and by a Bracer of Cloath to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on, or tied with Ribbons on the outſide of his Leg; by which it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p>But if the end of the bared Bone do chance to thruſt it ſelf ſo out, as that without great force it cannot be reſtored to its place; <hi>tunc è duobus malis minus eſt eligendum;</hi> then that end of the Bone which hath thruſt it ſelf ſo far out is to be ſawed off: and if this be done timely, before a Gangrene hath ſeized upon the Part, it may be performed with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>In St.<note place="margin">4. Obſervat. of both the Focills of the Leg fractured.</note> 
                        <hi>Clement</hi>'s Pariſh behind the Church, ſome years ſince, while I was one evening preparing my Dreſſings for the ſetting a fractured Thigh-bone in a little Child, I was haſtily fetcht to aſſiſt one Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> a Barber-chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, in the ſetting a Fracture of both the Focills of the Leg in a Man about ſixty years of age, of a tough dry Body. There I met Mr. <hi>Tatham,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious knowing Chirurgeon. The Fracture was oblique, almoſt <hi>ſecundum
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95669:247"/>longitudinem;</hi> and the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> or greater Focill had ſhot it ſelf out by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Ancle a great length. We endeavoured by a ſtrong Extenſion to reduce this fractured Bone into its place; but it yielded very difficultly to our endeavour: yet we reduce it, and afterwards cleanſed the Wound of what Shivers or pieces of Bones we met with, and brought the Lips of the Wound together by Suture, hoping thereby to keep the fractured Bone the cloſer. Then we dreſt the Wound with our Digeſtive warm, and with an <hi>empl. diachalcit.</hi> malaxt with <hi>ol. roſ.</hi> and over the fractured Parts we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Mixture following ſpred upon a double Cloath: ℞ <hi>flor. roſ. rubr. balauſt. baccar. myrtill. bol. Armen. ſang. dracon. an. q. ſ. pulveriz. cum albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. ovor. ol. roſ. &amp; acet. Miſc. ad conſiſt. mellis.</hi> This we faſtned by Bandage, as hath been ſhewed in Compound Fractures: and for the more ſtrengthening the fractured Member, we placed <hi>Splenia</hi> over that Bandage, with <hi>Ferulae</hi> upon them; and having faſtened them by three Ligatures, we placed the Member as much to the eaſe of the Patient as we could contrive, upon a Pillow quilted in the middle, with Junks to keep it ſteady. But theſe great Fractures with large Wounds, and near the Joint, are always ſubject to grievous Pain; and this much more, for that the Tendons and Muſculous fleſh were ſoarly torn, and ſtretcht by the great Extenſion: ſo it was not likely to be attended with leſſe miſchief then afterward befell it. We let him bloud that night, and gave him an Anodyne draught to diſpoſe him to reſt. But he ſlept little, his Pain continuing with much diſturbance: a Fever alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and within two or three days he became delirous, and in the abſence of his Attendents got out of his Bed; upon which the great Focil flew out as at firſt, and the poor man fell down on the floor as half dead. We were both preſently fetcht, and taking off the Dreſſings, we ſaw the Bone diſtorted, the lower Stitches broken, and the Wound of an ill aſpect, as it were tending to Mortification; alſo the Bone thruſt out ſo far, that there was no hopes of its being any more reduced by a new Extenſion. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we reſolved to ſaw off the end of it: and to that purpoſe having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things ready, we cut out the remaining Stitches, and turned the Foot on one ſide towards the Small of the leg, thruſting the Bone more out; the one ſawing the end off, whilſt the other with a <hi>Spatula</hi> defended the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donous fleſh underneath from being wounded by the Saw. That done, we cleanſed the Wound from the Saw-duſt, as alſo from the Shivers of little Bones which we had not diſcovered in our firſt dreſſing, they lying pricking the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> between the fractured Bones and Membranes, by which thoſe ſad Accidents had been haſtened. The Wound thus cleanſed, we turned the Foot right into its naturall place, there being no need of Extenſion: which being done, we ſcarified the Lips of the Wound, and waſht them <hi>cum ſpir. vini,</hi> with a little <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> diſſolved in it, and applied to the ends of the Bones Pledgits dipt in the ſame, and preſt out. We alſo dreſt the reſt of the Wound <hi>cum unguent baſilic.</hi> with a little <hi>ol. terebinth.</hi> warm, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a Mixture of an <hi>Emplaſtrum Paracelſ.</hi> and <hi>diachalcit.</hi> over the Wound and Parts about, and then a Compreſſe and Bandage over that, as in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Fractures. The great work was now, how to ſupport the Foot, and keep it even with the reſt of the Leg, there being ſo great a diſtance between them without any Bone. But we having placed the Leg upon a quilted Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, laid him again in his Bed, and fitted it in a Wainſcot-caſe, where it was kept ſteady and equall, and lay conveniently for our daily dreſſing him. This done, we committed him to the care of his Friends to keep him there quiet, and ordered him cordiall Juleps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After ſome hours we let him bloud again. From that time his Pains leſſened, and his Fever and other
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:95669:247"/>ill Symptoms went off as the Wound digeſted. But after ſome days the Heel became very painfull, and a Slough was diſcovered to us inflamed with an Ulceration ſticking to the very Bone. The Patient not permitting to have the Caſe, wherein his Foot and Leg was, ſtirred, it had not been raiſed up, as for perſpiration it ought to have been; whence this Ulcer became very troubleſome to us. For a preſent Relief, we laid him upon his Side, and dreſt the Ulcer with Lenients, to haſten ſeparation of that Eſcar. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Patient grew ſoon weary of this Poſition, which alſo was inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our dreſſing the great Wound, we therefore deſigned an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tin to receive his Foot and Let, this Heel to lie hollow in a place cut for that purpoſe, whereby we could daily dreſſe it without diſturbing the Patient, onely placing him down lower towards the Bed's feet, that the Heel might lie over it. The ſide of this Inſtrument, that came up by the Wound, was to be taken off at the time of dreſſing his Wound, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward placed cloſe again; whereby he was dreſt without diſturbing the weak Member. It lay alſo ſoft, by reaſon of the Folds of Linen we placed under and between the Leg and Inſtrument: it was alſo kept ſtraight, in hopes it might be ſupplied with <hi>Callus.</hi> But the Wound became ſinuous, and the Matter fouling the Bones hindred the growth of <hi>Callus;</hi> and while we waited for Exfoliation, the Lips of the Ulcer became callous, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the Cure. The Ulcer in the Heel we digeſted: and after we found the Bone would not incarn, we dreſt it with <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> with a little <hi>Merc. ſubl.</hi> diſſolved in it; by which dreſſing we haſtened the Exfoliation of the Bone, and cured the Ulcer. The Wound above was a larger work: but after the generation of <hi>Callus</hi> it cured as a <hi>Fiſtula</hi> with carious Bones. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient lived many years after: but through the ill diſpoſition of the Ulcer, the <hi>callus</hi> was hindred in its growth, whereby the Leg remained the ſhorter, almoſt as much as had been ſawed off of the Bone. Yet this was better, I ſuppoſe, then to leave the Bone diſtorted untill Digeſtion, as in ſuch like caſe I have ſeen done. But if the Bone be not ſo much diſtorted as that you may come to ſaw off the end of it, or if you cannot reduce it after the ordinary way; then you may with a Chizell-like inſtrument thruſt between the fractured ends of the Bone, and uſe it after the manner of a Lever, for the reduction of the Prominencies. But then it is ſuppoſed theſe fractured ends of them are within the Wound, and have not much over-ſhot one another, and the Fracture is tranſverſe or oblique: otherwiſe this may will doe little good; nay may poſſibly rive up the piece of Bone, and make another kind of Fracture, and grievouſly pain the Patient to no purpoſe. And that you may eaſily do, if the ends break off upon your hard and unſteady Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion. Therefore it becomes you to be very wary in making this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion; elſe, I ſay, you may put the Patient to ſad Pain, and doe him little good.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude, after your Extenſion is made, and the Bone reduced, you are to feel if there be any Shivers of Bones looſe, and pull them out. And if you perform this Operation in a Fracture newly made, then you are to prevent Inflammation, and all other Accidents, by dreſſing up the Patient with ſuch Medicines as have been propoſed in Compound Fractures; and make your Bandage ſo, that you may come to dreſſe the Wound, as occaſion ſhall offer, with as little moleſtation of the fractured Member as is poſſible; having a care you grieve not the tender Parts with Splints, untill the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation be over, and the Wound well digeſted.</p>
                     <p>Then afterwards 'tis to be endeavoured, that the Bones robb'd of their <hi>Perioſteum</hi> may again be incarned or exfoliated; which is the work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:95669:248"/>yet ought to be helpt by Medicines which have a manifeſt hot and drying quality, and a peculiar faculty thereto, of which there are enough ſet down in the Treatiſe of <hi>Gun-ſhot Wounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Bones exfoliated, and Cure of the Ulcer will ſucceed of courſe, or may be performed by Epuloticks, of which you may have choice in this Book.</p>

                     <p>IN ſeverall Obſervations in this Book I have had occaſion to take notice of the inconvenience many people have fallen into through the wickedneſs of thoſe who pretend to the reducing luxated Joints by the peculiar name of <hi>Bone-ſetters:</hi> who, (that they may not want imployment) do uſually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every Bone diſlocated they are called to look upon; though poſſibly it be but a <hi>Ganglion,</hi> or other crude Tumour or preternatural Protuberance of ſome part of a Joint. In which caſes their raſh Extenſions do frequently cauſe ſad Accidents. But their more gainfull way is, by extending and dreſſing up Joints rather wrencht then diſlocated: in which if they eſcape undetected, they muſt needs reap great credit, the Patient recovering ſo ſoon the eaſe and uſe of them. Whereas if the Joints happen really to be luxated, ſcarce one of them knoweth how to reduce them. In conſideration of this daily abuſe, and the inadvertency of the young Chirurgeon, whoſe not timely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Luxation renders it more difficult to reduce, I have thought fit to ſay ſomewhat to this part of Chirurgery; and firſt in generall.</p>
                     <p>He that will give an account of <hi>Luxations,</hi>

                     <list>
                        <item>I. <hi>Symphyſis</hi> in its originall ſignification denotes a <hi>Connaſcency</hi> or <hi>Growing together;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Symphyſis.</note> and perhaps is meant of thoſe Bones which in young Children are diſtinct, but after ſome years unite and conſolidate into one Bone. So the <hi>Os ileon</hi> and <hi>Os pubis</hi> are two diſtinct Bones in a Child, but unite into one in a Man: the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> is a diſtinct Bone from it in a Child, whereas in a Man they do intirely unite. But cuſtome and the uſage of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours hath found out another ſenſe of the word, fitted to adult perſons; in whom it is uſed to mean ſuch a Connexion, or two Bones together as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable: and of theſe there are two ſorts.
<list>
                              <item>1. An immediate Conjunction, or Juxtapoſition, (if I may ſo call it,) without the interpoſition of any other Body. Of which we find three Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
<list>
                                    <item>Firſt, <hi>Sutura,</hi> or the indented Conjunction of Bones in the Scull.</item>

                              <item>2. Mediate, where the Connexion is made by interpoſition of another Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Of theſe we likewiſe find three ſorts: which notwithſtanding are not ſo peculiar to the <hi>Symphyſis</hi> as it is oppoſed to <hi>Articulatio,</hi> but that they may be found in that alſo. They are theſe that follow.
<list>
                                    <item>Firſt, <hi>Syſſarcoſis,</hi> when two Bones are joyned together by the intervention of Fleſh. An inſtance of this in the <hi>Symphyſis</hi> is, the Conjunction of the Teeth to the Mandible by the Fleſh of the Gums. In Articulations we ſee it in the Elbow or any other Joint, where one Bone is connected to another by Muſcles.</item>
                                    <item>Secondly, <hi>Synneuroſis,</hi> when the Connexion is made by a Ligament. Of this in <hi>Symphyſis</hi> we find inſtances in the Connexion of the <hi>Oſſa pubis</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, eſpecially in Women, by a ligamentous ſubſtance. In Articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is either round, as that which unites the head of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> to the <hi>Coxa;</hi> or broad, as the Tendon of the <hi>Patella,</hi> which unites it to the <hi>Os tibiae.</hi>

Articulations are moſt of them ſo joyned, there being few Bones deſtin'd for motion which have not cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous heads for the facility thereof. Theſe two latter ſorts of Union are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in ſome Articulations; as in the <hi>Oſſa coxae,</hi> where you have Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons and Griſtles both to joyn them together.

                           <hi>Articulatio</hi> is a Connexion of Bones with aptneſſe of Motion. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been anticipated already concerning this Head, becauſe of its coincidence with <hi>Symphyſis,</hi> in the forementioned inſtances. But take it as it is in it ſelf, and you will find it to have this difference. There is,
<list>
                              <item>1. A conſpicuous Motion, which where it happens, the Conjunction is called <hi>Diarthroſis;</hi> as in the Elbow, Thigh, and Knee.</item>
                              <item>2. An obſcure one, where the Conjunction is called <hi>Synarthroſis;</hi> as in the joyning the <hi>Carpus</hi> to the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> the <hi>Tarſus</hi> to the <hi>Metatarſus.</hi> And both theſe are divided into the three following Species.

                     <p>Many other things might be ſaid on this ſubject, were it pertinent to my preſent deſign, which is onely to regard the Union and due Conformity of Joints, in order to the Doctrine of Luxations, in which the Articulations are chiefly concerned. For when thoſe that are united by <hi>Symphyſis,</hi> as the Sutures of the Head, and the Bones of the <hi>Maxilla ſuperior,</hi> are diſlocated, there is always a Fracture concomitant, and the whole is treated as a Fracture. When the Teeth are diſlocated, or to the diſlocated, a Tooth-drawer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted.</p>

                     <p>Articulations therefore, whether by <hi>Diarthroſis</hi> or <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which my preſent Diſcourſe concerning Luxations is founded.</p>
                     <p>When therefore two Bones,<note place="margin">Definition of a Luxation.</note> which being naturally united make up a Joint, are ſeparated from each other, we call it a <hi>Luxation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ancients called it a Slipping of the Head of a Bone out of its Cavity. Which is true of the great Joints, but not of all: for the broad end of the Clavicle, where it reſteth upon the <hi>Scapula,</hi> hath neither Head nor Cavity, yet is capable of Luxation.</p>
                     <p>Luxations admit of ſeverall <hi>Differences.</hi>

                        <item>1. From the Subject; <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be a place of obſcure motion, or a manifeſt one. An inſtance of one is, when the Clavicle recedes from the <hi>Scapula;</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call a Disjunction. Of the other, where an Elbow, Shoulder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is disjointed; which is moſt properly termed Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is alſo a peculiar Luxation proper to Children, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> of a Bone ſeparateth from the Bone, they being not throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated into one; which however is treated like a Fracture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerveth no place in this Diſcourſe.</item>
                        <item>2. From the Degree of it; <hi>viz.</hi> whether it ſlip out wholly, or onely in part, <hi>viz.</hi> to the margin of the Cavity that containeth it. To this latter ſort may be referred thoſe Elongations which are the effect of an Humour ſoaking upon a Ligament, (as that of the <hi>Coxa,</hi>) thereby making it liable to be ſtretcht, and to be thruſt quite out upon every little force.</item>
                        <item>3. From the Situation and Figure of the Part, as whether upward, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, forward, backward, on the right ſide, left ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which more in the following Chapters.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Luxations are internall,<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> or externall. The internall are the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which affect the Joints, and either by relaxing the Ligaments give way to the Bone to depart from its naturall ſeat; or by a contraction of the Tendons put it upwards out of the Cavity. Both theſe ſorts I have ſeen in Children, and it's likely it was in ſome of them hereditary; as <hi>Sennertus</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>à gibboſis gibboſos, à claudis claudos generari.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Cauſes are, Blows, Falls, violent Extenſion: in which latter caſes Infants ſometimes ſuffer by the hands of Midwifes, or at more age by the negligence of Nurſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of Luxation may be taken from the loſſe or imperfect motion of the Joint,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and from the different reſemblance it hath with the contrary ſound Member; there appearing to the eies or touch a Cavity in the Part whence it receded, and a Protuberance where it is lodged: the Member is alſo rendred longer or ſhorter, according as the Bone is diſtorted.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of Reduction are the contrary to what have been before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.<note place="margin">Signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> There is alſo a craſhing noiſe made by the Bone in its return to the Cavity. But this is not always a certain ſign; for it may proceed from an Eruption of ſome part of the margin of the Cup or Cavity. In which caſe the Luxation is for the moſt part rendered incapable of Reſtitution. But this Fracture maketh a different noiſe from the other, and may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed by the diſcerning Artiſt.</p>
                     <p>In Children and moiſt Bodies luxated Bones are eaſieſt reduced,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but are with great difficulty retained: in elderly and dry Bodies the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth.</p>
                     <p>Luxations of long continuance are difficultly reduced, and are for the moſt part as hardly retained, the parts growing emaciated. Thoſe of the <hi>Vertebrae</hi>
                        <pb n="481" facs="tcp:95669:249"/>occaſion'd by externall Accidents are for the moſt part mortall: whereas ſome of thoſe by Congeſtion are frequently cured.</p>
                     <p>The Bone luxated maketh compreſſion on the neighbouring Parts whither it ſlippeth;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and accordingly as thoſe Parts are of more or leſs ſenſe, ſo are the Pain and Accidents that attend it. You ought to haſten the reſtoring it to its place as ſoon as may be. The work is purely Chirurgicall, it having no dependency upon Nature, but the Extenſion and forcing back of the Bone into its proper ſeat is done by the Hands of the Artiſt. There are four Intentions neceſſary to the Cure: 1. Extenſion, 2. Repoſition, 3. Deligation, 4. Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or placing of the Member in a right Poſition.</p>
                     <p>Extenſion is firſt required,<note place="margin">1. Intention.</note> becauſe of the ſituation of the Bone, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of its due Socket rendreth the motion of the Muſcles uſeleſs, or rather hurtfull, which the more they pull the Bone, the more they diſtort it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Joint. This therefore cannot be committed to Nature, but requireth manuall Operation.</p>
                     <p>The Extenſion being well made,<note place="margin">2. Intention.</note> you are at the ſame inſtant to reſtore it to the place it fell from. And to doe this, you muſt conſider well the luxated Joint, and which way it ſlipped out; for it requireth to be returned in the ſame manner. If it lie on the right Side, it muſt be preſt back to the left: and ſo if it be luxated forwards, it muſt be forced backwards. The Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der requireth one way, the Elbow another, and the Knee or Ancle another. If the Luxation hath been of any continuance, or if the contraction of the Muſcles be great, it will be reaſonable that you firſt relax them by emollient Embrocations, <hi>viz. unguent. dialthaeae, axung, human.</hi> &amp;c. leſt by your vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent forcing in the Bone you affect the Nerves, and cauſe a <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Being ſatisfied in the Repoſition of the Bone,<note place="margin">3. Intention.</note> you ſhall then take care to keep it ſo: and that is performed by Deligation. But before make the Bandage, you ought to apply ſuch Medicaments as have virtue to reſiſt the Influx of Humours, and ſtrengthen the Part: and thoſe are Aſtringents, and ſuch as have been propoſed in the foregoing Chapter of Fractures; <hi>viz. bol. Armen. ſang. dracon. farin. volatil. balauſt. flor. roſ. rub. cum albumine ovi, aceto, aut vino rub.</hi> If there be great Pain, you may embrocate <hi>cum ol. roſ. lumbricor. maſtichin.</hi> and apply <hi>empl. è bolo, diapalm. de minio,</hi> &amp;c. Then place a Compreſſe wrung out of ſome of the aforeſaid Liquours on that Part whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſuſpect the Bone may again tend, and rowl it on cloſe accordingly as you ſee occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Intention is Collocation,<note place="margin">4. Intention.</note> or placing of the Member; and that ought, for the eaſe of the Patient, to lie ſoft, and ſomewhat raiſed up, neither much extended, nor too much bent, a middle figure being beſt to prevent Pain. Yet if it be the Shoulder that is luxated, the Elbow ought to be kept to the Side, and the Hand upon the Breaſt. If no Accident happen, you muſt not dreſſe it again till the ſeventh day; and then you may alter the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and move the Joint a little to and fro, and dreſſe it up with ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments as may give a breathing to the Humour, and corroborate the weak Joint. In caſe it itch, bath it with Salt-water; otherwiſe with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction <hi>ex ſummitat. abſinth. flor. cham. roſ. rub. balauſt. bacc. myrtill. juniperi, nuc. cupreſſ.</hi> &amp;c. to which may be added <hi>ſpir. vini.</hi> All greazy Applications relax the Tendons, and prolong the Cure.</p>
                     <p>Luxations made by Congeſtion do require Emollients to reſolve and breath forth the crude Humour affecting the Joint, Ligaments and Tendons: to which purpoſe ℞ <hi>rad. althaeae</hi> ℥vj. <hi>rad. cucumeris aſinini</hi> ℥iij. <hi>ſummitat. majoran.</hi> Mij. <hi>coctis in brodio ex pedibus vitul. &amp; contuſis adde pulv. ſem. foenugraeci &amp; lini an.</hi> ℥j. <hi>ol. lilior. axung. human. an. part. aeq. fiat Cataplaſma.</hi> You may

That Matter being thus reſolved, you may then proceed in the Reduction of the relaxed Bone: and after you have reduced it, apply ſuch Medicaments to it as may dry up the ſuperfluous Humidity, and ſtrengthen the Joint: of which ſort I have given you an example in the fourth Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There will alſo be required ſome extraordinary Bandage to retain the Bone in its place: but of that I ſhall have more fitly occaſion to diſcourſe in ſome of the following Obſervations, as alſo of <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> &amp;c. which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend great Luxations.</p>

                        <item>1. One more acute, called by Anatomiſts <hi>Corona;</hi> which hath no Socket properly ſo called, but playeth in the Hollow of the Cheek according to the motion of the Temporall Muſcles, whoſe Tendon is inſerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</item>
                        <item>2. Another more obtuſe, with a roundiſh Head, called <hi>Condylus.</hi> This hath for its Socket the firſt <hi>Sinus</hi> of the <hi>Os temporum,</hi> in which it moves; and is kept cloſe to it by the Muſcles which lay hold either of the <hi>Corona</hi> before mentioned, as the Temporall, or of the outward broad Angle, as the <hi>Maſſeter,</hi> or the inſide of the broad part of the Jaw, as the <hi>Pterygoïdes.</hi> Theſe Muſcles, by their perpetuall tendency to a contraction, (which is the nature of all Muſcles,) keep the Bone ſteady in its ſituation; but much more ſo when they are voluntarily contracted for Maſtication, Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that though Nature hath made other Muſcles to open the Jaws, as well as theſe to ſhut them, yet they are in themſelves ſlender, and not inſerted into this part of the Jaw, but quite before at the Chin; ſo that in their motion they do not pull down this part of the Jaw, but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part onely: whereas the attollent Muſcles being laid nearer to the <hi>Condyli</hi> on each ſide, keep them ſo cloſe to their Sockets as to make them a Joint, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of motion: from whence, according to the cuſtome of Levers and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances, it falleth out, that thoſe little diagaſtrick Muſcles, by being applied to the remoter part of the Jaw, which maketh the circumference, become equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent to all the bigger Muſcles before mentioned; nay, are ſometimes ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, that upon over-ſtretching, as in Gaping and Yawning, they pull the <hi>Condylus</hi> out of its Socket. Sometimes the attollent Muſcles themſelves do pull it, when we violently gnaw any large Bone, Griſtle, or other thing that is hard, and withall ſo big as to be neceſſarily detained in the fore-part of the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>This Luxation can be made but one way, <hi>viz.</hi> when it ſlippeth over the fore-ſide of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and paſſeth into the Cavity of the Cheek under the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:95669:250"/>
                        <hi>Os jugale;</hi> it being ſo defended by Bones, that other waies are impoſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Fracture.</p>
                     <p>When this Luxation happeneth,<note place="margin">Signs of Jaws lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</note> the lower Jaw is thruſt forward, the Teeth are prominent beyond thoſe of the upper, the Patient can neither ſwallow nor ſpeak nor chew, nor indeed ſhut his Chaps. If you ſee him preſently before any Tumour ſupervene, you will find the Temporall Muſcle rigid. If one ſide onely be diſlocated, the Mouth is diſtorted, as if the Patient had a <hi>Spaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> the fore-part of the Jaw is thruſt down on one ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reduction of the Jaws is ſaid to be difficult,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and that if they be not timely reduced, ill Accidents do happen, <hi>viz. Paralyſis,</hi> Strangulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I can onely ſay, that I never met with any difficulty in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing them, nor yet ſaw any ſuch Accidents as by Authours are mentioned: but certainly they are in danger of famiſhing, for they can neither eat nor drink while the Jaws are luxated.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Repoſition of the Jaws,<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> the Patient ought to be ſeated firm, and his Head held ſteady, leſt it ſtart back in the time of Reduction. Then place a couple of Wedges of Wood cloſe between his great Teeth, as far as you can thruſt them, and your Thumbs cloſe by them, and your Fingers externally under both the Jaws, extending them moderately; and at the ſame inſtant preſſe the farther parts of his Jaws downwards, and raiſe up the fore part. If his Teeth be too ſharp for your Thumbs, put a fold of Linen between. If onely one of the Jaws be luxated, move it to the contrary ſide, and keeping it in that poſture, place your Hand as aforeſaid, with your Thumb upon his great Teeth, preſſing that part downwards, and raiſe the fore-part upwards by a quick moderate Extenſion, and you ſhall feel it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and may conclude it ſo by the equall meeting of his Teeth, and by the opening and ſhutting of his Mouth, alſo by his ready Speech.

                     <p>A Woman aged about fifty ſix years was ſent to me from a worthy Lady in a neighbouring County:<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of both Jaws.</note> both her Jaws were luxated, the obtuſe Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them were ſlipt forward and ſhot under the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> and her Chin was thruſt forward and inclining down towards her Collar-bone. She had been ſo three days, during which ſhe could neither eat, drink, nor ſpeak. I placed her in a Chair, and Dr. <hi>Lenthall,</hi> who came with her, held her Head. Then I placed my Hands on the outſide and under her Jaws, and my Thumbs upon her great Teeth, with a Compreſſe of ſoft Linen under each; and whilſt I preſſed hard down the farther parts of the Jaws, I raiſed up her Chin, and reduced them in a moment: and to ſatisfie her that they would not ſlip down again upon an ordinary motion of them, I perſwaded her to eat and drink; then diſmiſſed her without application of Plaiſter or Bandage.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about fourty years of age,<note place="margin">2.

One morning, walking amongſt my Patients, I met his Apothecary, who telling me the caſe his Patient was in, I replied, his Jaw was certainly luxated: upon which I was the next day conſulted, and ſaw it ſo. I laid my Hand on the outſide of that diſtorted Jaw, and placed my Thumb with a Rag wound about it upon his great Teeth as far as I could thruſt it, and laying my other Hand upon his ſound Jaw, I drew the diſtorted one ſtraight out; and
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:95669:251"/>whilſt I preſſed down the hinder part, I made Extenſion, raiſed up his Chin, and reduced it. He did not at that inſtant believe it, but he was ſoon after confirmed by the uſe he had of it. It continued well without any manner of Application to it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Luxation of the Clavicle, or the Collar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</head>
                     <p>THE Clavicle is a crooked Bone made in the figure of an <hi>ſ.</hi> one end of which being thicker,<note place="margin">The Clavicle deſcribed.</note> and almoſt three ſquare, is inſerted into a Cavity purpoſely fitted for it in the firſt Bone of the <hi>Sternon,</hi> and bound in by a ſtrong ligamentous Membrane. The other end, being broad and flat, is joyned to the <hi>Acromium,</hi> where it not onely ſerveth to keep the Shoulder at due diſtance from the <hi>Sternon,</hi> but alſo aſſiſteth thoſe ſeverall Proceſſes which are provided by Nature to preſerve the Shoulder-bone from ſlipping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from its Cavity.</p>
                     <p>This Bone is capable of a double Luxation, one at the <hi>Sternon,</hi> and that onely outwardly, where it riſeth from the Breaſt, and lieth like a Lump. The broad end near the <hi>Acromium</hi> is alſo ſubject to a twofold Luxation, <hi>viz.</hi> upward, and forward; being defended from all other Diſtortions by its neighbouring Bones.</p>
                     <p>This Luxation is for the moſt part occaſioned by a Fall and pitching upon the Shoulder.<note place="margin">Cauſe and Sign of a luxated Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicle. Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</note> It is diſcerned by the Prominence it maketh.</p>
                     <p>The Clavicle is not ſo ſubject to Luxation as other Bones; but being luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is moſt difficultly retained after Reſtitution, by reaſon of the ſmoothneſſe of its heads, and the little hold they have upon the <hi>Acromium</hi> and <hi>Sternon:</hi> and if it be not reſtored, the uſe of the Arm is impaired in ſome of its motions.</p>
                     <p>The Reduction of the Clavicle,<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> which end ſoever of it be luxated, muſt be made by drawing that Shoulder backwards, and by preſſing the luxated end even with the <hi>Acromium,</hi> or to the Cavity of the Bone of the <hi>Sternon,</hi> whence it departed. Neither of the places affordeth it much room, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will require your greater care: for if you place it not exactly, it will ſcarce hold right till you make your Applications. Therefore you muſt have ready Emplaſticks, Compreſſes, and Bandage. Splints are alſo of uſe, whether they be of Paſtboard, the Scabbard of a Sword, or Tin. The Bandage ought to be a Rowler with two heads to come over the Shoulders, and under the Arm-pit, making ſo many Circumvolutions as may retain the Dreſſings cloſe. This being well made, his Arm muſt be kept up with a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin or Towell, and his Hand placed upon his Breaſt. If all be well, you ought not to looſen the Bandage till you judge it united, which may be gueſſed at by the eaſe and uſe of that Arm.</p>
                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:95669:251"/>
                     <p>I Was fetched to a young Fellow,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle luxated.</note> who by a Fall from his Horſe was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have broken his left Shoulder. Upon view of it, I ſaw the end of the Clavicle ſeparated from the <hi>Acromium,</hi> and lying prominent without any manner of Fracture; but the head of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> was bruiſed, and remained ſugillated long after. I cauſed one ſtanding behind him to pull back the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and with my hands forced down the end of the Clavicle, and placed it to the <hi>Acromium;</hi> then applied an Emplaſter of aſtringent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders mixt <hi>cum album. ovor.</hi> &amp;c. over the Clavicle and Shoulder, with a piece of Paſtboard wet <hi>in aceto</hi> and Whites of eggs; over which I applied a dry one, and upon that a Compreſs wet with ſome of the former Liquour, and rowled it on with Bandage as above ſaid; then wet that part of it over the Clavicle with Whites of eggs, to ſtrengthen it and retain it firm. That done, his Shirt and Doublet were put on, and his Arm tied up, as hath been ſaid. Then I put him to bed, and let him bloud in the other Arm, and kept his Body ſoluble by lenient Purgatives. After he had lain four or five days in bed, I obſerving the Bandage tight, and the Pain and Accidents di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, permitted him to riſe, and walk up and down in the houſe. About the eighteenth day I took of Dreſſings, and ſaw te Bone right in its place, the Parts about being onely marked with the extravaſated bloud. I embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them with <hi>ol. lumbric. &amp; ſpir. vini,</hi> and applied an <hi>empl. ſtict. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſi &amp; diapalmae,</hi> rowling it up as before, and from that time dreſſed it no more, but ſaw him afterwards well abroad.</p>
                     <p>Another having by accident of a Fall in wraſtling ſtarted the end of the Clavicle from the <hi>Sternon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of a Luxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clavicle.</note> I made Extenſion after the ſame manner as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid, by pulling his Shoulders backwards, and preſſing the while with my hands upon that end of the Collar-bone, till I had replaced it, then dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it as afore ſaid. But the next day, finding the Patient in Pain, and the Dreſſings raiſed up, I concluded the Bone diſtorted. Whereupon I cauſed a Tin-plate to be made in the form of the Clavicle, and to reach form one Shoulder to the other, cut at the ends, to receive the fore-parts of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and keep them out. Then I took off Dreſſings, and reſtored the Bone again to its place, and repeating the former Applications, placed the Tin-plate over the Compreſſe, and rowled it on cloſe. This Plate ſate eaſy, and ſerved to keep out his Shoulders, alſo retained the Bone in its place, whereby he was happily cured without more dreſſing.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Luxation of the Shoulder.</head>
                     <p>THE head of the Shoulder-bone being round is inſerted into ſo ſhallow a Cavity in the <hi>Scapula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deſcription of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bones.</note> that were there no other Guards for it, it would fall out or be thruſt out almoſt upon every occaſion. But Nature, that found that Shallowneſſe neceſſary to the variety of motions which is intended for the Joint, found other ways of ſecuring it from running out. <hi>Viz.</hi> 1. upwards it is prohibited from an excurſion by the <hi>Acromium,</hi> the Proceſſe <hi>anchriformis,</hi> and the broad end of the Clavicle, which reaching over the latter to the edge of the former, addeth to the ſtrength of the place. Nor is this all, for Nature hath made a ſtrong Ligament which reacheth tranſverſe from the Proceſſe <hi>anchriformis</hi> to the <hi>Acromium;</hi> and to confirm all, hath laid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath theſe not onely a ſtrong circular Ligament, which involveth the whole head of the Shoulder, (being indeed a collection of the Tendons or the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles, which lying under and upon the <hi>Scapula</hi> particularly ſerve for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> or elſe lying upon the <hi>Humerus,</hi> do take their origine from the <hi>Scapula,</hi>) but alſo a Tendon of one of the heads of the <hi>Biceps,</hi> which paſſing through a peculiar Notch or Trench of the <hi>Humerus</hi> inſerteth it ſelf into the head of the <hi>Scapula.</hi> Over all theſe lieth the <hi>Muſculus deltoïdes,</hi> binding all in ſo ſtrongly, that if the Elbow chance to be ſo puſhed that it forceth the <hi>Os humeri</hi> upon this Fortreſſe, it ſooner breaketh into ſhivers then maketh a way through. 2. The principall Guard it hath from falling inwards and downwards is its pendulous poſture, together with the many Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles that keep it in that poſture, and chiefly the Tendon of the <hi>Biceps externus,</hi> (as it is called in our Hall,) and of the <hi>ſubſcapularis,</hi> with the <hi>rotundus minor.</hi> Yet are not theſe ſo ſtrong, but that between the Tendon of the <hi>ſubſcapularis</hi> and the <hi>Biceps externus</hi> it is apt to flie out into the <hi>Axilla.</hi> All other ways are ſo barricadoed with Bones or Tendons, that the Luxation is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: yet I have ſeen it lie forward ſomewhat under the Pectorall Muſcle; but whether it was forced thither in their attempting to reduce it out of the <hi>Axilla,</hi> I cannot certainly ſay, but do ſuppoſe it might.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of this Luxation are for the moſt part externall,<note place="margin">Cauſes of Luxation the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> by ſome violent force, either in Wraſtling, Running, or by a Fall from a Horſe, or the like. In the time of War it may happen by the force of great Shot or Splinters. Some inſtances whereof you may ſee in the Treatiſe of <hi>Gun-ſhot.</hi> But it ſometimes happeneth from an internall Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Catarrh or Fluxion of Humours upon the Muſcles or Tendons, which gradually relaxeth them to ſuch a degree, that the head of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> ſlideth down into the <hi>Axilla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its deſcent into the <hi>Axilla</hi> appeareth by an unuſuall Cavity in the head of the <hi>Scapula,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Signs.</note> where it naturally is full and round. You may alſo feel the head of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> lying in the Axilla hard and round: the Patient's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow hangs from his Side, and cannot be brought ſo cloſe as the ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Pain, nor can he bring his Hand to his Mouth, or ſtretch it upright againſt a Wall. If the head of the Shoulder be diſtorted forward, that part
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:95669:252"/>will appear prominent, with an unwonted Cavity behind, if you compare it ſtrictly with the other Shoulder: the Elbow alſo hangeth backwards, and will not endure to be brought forwards.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be made by a Relaxation of the Tendons, the Patient's complaint will inform you, and the Emaciation of the Arm will make the foreſaid Symptoms more apparent.</p>
                     <p>A Luxation of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> from an externall Cauſe is not very hard to reduce in Children or ſoft Bodies, if timely undertaken:<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but contrary in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly people and tough muſculous Bodies: and ſuch are frequently ſlow in recovery of their former ſtrength and motion. Sometimes a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth them, and they emaciate: but by timely Endeavours they do recover. If in the Reduction or otherwiſe any part of the <hi>Cupula</hi> chance to be frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, the retention of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> is not an eaſie task. Luxations made by Fluxion may be eaſily reduced, but are moſt difficultly retained in the <hi>Capſula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Repoſition of the luxated Shoulder is performed either by the Hand,<note place="margin">Reduction by the Hand.</note> Bandage, or force of Inſtruments. He that will reduce it by Hand muſt put it in a motion contrary to that it went out by. In its going out, it is firſt thruſt or pulled forwards, till it come beyond the edges of the <hi>Cupula;</hi> then it falleth down below the <hi>Cupula,</hi> and is by the Muſcles pulled backward. He that will reduce the Bone this firſt way muſt reverſe theſe motions; <hi>viz.</hi> firſt bring it forward, then upward, then thruſt it in. By the obſerving this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I have reduced the Shoulders of Infants and little Children ſo ſoon, that the Standers by have hard them knap in before they knew they were out. But the way of reducing the Shoulder in thoſe of more growth muſt be, if done by one man alone, by placing the Patient in a low Seat, and clapping his Fingers under his Arm-pit, his Knee or Thighs to the outſide of his Elbow, and his Head to the point of his Shoulder. By his Fingers ſtrongly bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he pulleth the Bone both forward and upward. By his Thigh or Knee preſſing his Elbow to his Side, he doth likewiſe help to raiſe it and bring it forward. The preſſure of his Head keepeth down the <hi>Scapula,</hi> that it may not riſe with the Bone. But becauſe this application of the Knee, Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not eaſily practicable but upon little and ſlender men, we generally commit the preſſing of the Elbow toward the Ribs to another man.</p>
                     <p>After this manner the Elbow is brought quite back to the Spine: which being done, his other Hand muſt be placed under the <hi>Axilla,</hi> to raiſe the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> forward and upward, whilſt the Chirurgeon with his hands preſſeth down the <hi>Scapula</hi> to receive the Bone.</p>
                     <p>When the head of the <hi>Os humeri</hi> lieth diſtorted forwards under part of the Pectorall Muſcle, the Patient's Elbow muſt be drawn backward, and held cloſe to the Spine, whilſt the Chirurgeon preſſeth with both his Hands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly upon the head of the Bone.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another way of reſtoring the luxated Shoulder by the Hand thus: You are to make choice of a proper luſty Fellow on whoſe ſhoulder you muſt hang the Patient by the luxated Arm, bringing his Hand over to the Fellow's Breaſt. If the weight of the Patient be not ſufficient to make the Extenſion, ſome other body may hang upon him, or pull him by the Legs downward.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe ways of Reduction by the the Hand are not always fecible,<note place="margin">Reduction by Bandage.</note> eſpecially in ſtrong muſcular people, we therefore make uſe of Bandage and ſeverall ſorts of Engins. The moſt common way of Bandage is by that of the Girt, which Girt hath a Boulſter in the middle, and the ends are tackt firmly together. In the uſe of it the Patient muſt be placed ſo, that part
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:95669:253"/>of the Girt with the Boulſter is to be placed under the Arm-pit, and the other part over the Chirurgeon's Neck, that he may thereby with all his force raiſe up the head of the <hi>Humerus:</hi> which that he may the better doe, his Aſſiſtent muſt ſit behind the Patient, and pull his Arm backward with all his might; and if the Chirurgeon preſſeth with his Hands upon the head of the <hi>Scapula</hi> at the ſame time he raiſeth up the <hi>Humerus,</hi> he ſhall reduce it more eaſily.</p>
                     <p>There is another way of Reduction by Bandage, and that is, by laying the Patient flat on his Back on the ground, the Chirurgeon ſitting behind him, and making Extenſion by the foreſaid Girt or other Bandage placed under the <hi>Axilla,</hi> whilſt his Aſſiſtent lieth along at the Patient's Side, and preſſeth with his Heel upon the foreſaid Bandage, and at the ſame inſtant taketh the Patient by the Hand, and pulleth his Arm with all his force. Thus by their ſeverall Extenſions the head of the Shoulder-bone may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and reduced.</p>
                     <p>Inſtruments proper for the Reduction of the luxated Shoulder are,<note place="margin">Reduction by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Ladder, Coulſtaffe, Pulleys, <hi>Gloſſocomium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The way of Extenſion by a Ladder is, that the Patient climbe up three or four Steps of it, and put his lame Arm over one of the Staves, placing it between his Side and the head of the <hi>Humerus;</hi> and that a ſtrong Fellow take hold of that Arm, and pull it forcibly down backward, whilſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hangeth by it.</p>
                     <p>The way by a Coulſtaffe is ſafer. The Staffe muſt have a Bunch in the middle ſomewhat Wedge-like, and covered with a ſoft Boulſter fit to place under the Patient's Arm-pit. In order to the Extenſion, the Patient muſt be ſeated near ſome Poſt or Pillar, in which the Pulley muſt be faſtened to extend his Arm; and the Bandage muſt be made a little above the Elbow: which being faſtned, and the Coulſtaffe placed, and ſupported by a couple of Fellows, the Chirurgeon muſt ſtand on the contrary ſide, with his Hands on each ſide of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> to preſſe it downward, and keep the Patient firm in his Seat, and govern the Operation, taking care that the Wedge be placed right whilſt the Extenſion is making, leſt they break the Bone, or otherwiſe miſchief him.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gloſſocomium,</hi> commonly called the Commander, is of uſe in the moſt ſtrong tough Bodies, and where the Luxation hath been of long continuance, and will not yield to the other ways of Extenſion. There ought to be great care in the uſe of it, for many ſhrewd Accidents have happened thereby.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Humerus</hi> luxated by Relaxation of the Ligaments and Tendons is reſtored to its place after ſome of the was above ſaid, but doth require your induſtry to retain it after it is reduced: more of which by and by.</p>
                     <p>A Lady going on evening out of her Coach into her houſe,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a luxated Shoulder.</note> trode upon her Gown, and fell down. I being fetcht, found her ſitting in the ſame room grievouſly complaining of her right Shoulder. Lookig upon it, and feeling the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> lying in her Arm-pit, I endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it by Circumrotation: but it not yielding thereto, I cauſed one of her Servants to pull her Elbow back towards the Spine, then to thruſt it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. During which I ſtood on the contrary ſide, with one of my Hands upon the head of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and the other under the <hi>Os humeri;</hi> and at the ſame inſtant my Aſſiſtent thruſt it forward. I forced it into its place: the people ſtanding by heard it knap in, and the Patient declared it by the eaſe ſhe felt. Then I applied an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> round the weak Joint, with a proportionable Compreſſe wrung out of <hi>Oxycrate,</hi> and rowled it on. After
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:95669:253"/>which her Servants led her to her Chamber to bed. The next morning I viſited her. She had reſted well, and was ſo eaſiy, that her Phyſician, Sir <hi>William Gideon,</hi> would ſcarce believe that the Bone had been luxated. The Lady prepared to remove to her Country-houſe, and undertook the Cure her ſelf by ſome Plaiſters of her own. But during the application of them her Arm grew weaker, and emaciated very much, and was painfull about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Muſcle <hi>Deltoïdes,</hi> and ſo to her Hand, with a nummedneſſe in ſome of her Fingers. Whereupon ſhe returned back, and conſulted Phyſicians. One whereof, ſuppoſing the Bone ſtill diſlocated, adviſed the conſulting a Bone-ſetter. I being preſent, he acknowledged the Bone well ſet. What he would have ſaid had I been abſent, may eaſily be gueſſed by his former dealing with others of my Profeſſion. From that time Antiparalyticks were preſcribed, a Fontanell was made in that Arm near the Muſcle <hi>Deltoïdes,</hi> alſo Embrocations and Plaiſters were externally applied; whereby ſhe recovered the uſe of her Arm.</p>
                     <p>A Nobleman who was a Commander of Horſe in that Army which came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervat. of Reduction by the Foot.</note> was by ſome accident thrown off his Horſe, and would not be raiſed off the ground till I came. He complained of his right Shoulder. I looking upon it, felt the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> lie diſtorted in his Arm-pit. I endeavoured to reduce it by my Hands, as above in the former Obſervation: but it not yielding thereto, I cauſed Mr. <hi>James Davies,</hi> who was Chirurgeon to thoſe Guards, to pull off his Boot from his right Leg, and to lie along upon the ground by his Lordſhip, to make Extenſion that way. Whilſt he was making ready, I clapt a Compreſſe under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Arm-pit, with a Towell over it, and placed my ſelf at his Lordſhip's Shoulder, and made Extenſion by the Towell, whilſt my Aſſiſtent took the Patient by the Hand, and thruſt his Heel into his Arm-pit with all his might. We having thus reduced the Bone into its place, I applied an <hi>emplaſtrum è bolo</hi> over the Shoulder, and a Compreſſe of Tow preſt out of <hi>acetum</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arm-pit, and rowled them on. That done, his Servants made him ready, and helpt him upon his Horſe. I made him a viſit that night at his Quarters, deſigning to let him bloud in the contrary Arm: but his Shoulder being eaſy, and not hurt in any other part, I took my leave of him, tellig him his Shoulder ought not to be dreſſed till after ſix or ſeven days. But this perſon forgetting what I had ſaid, thought himſelf neglected, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to his ſuperiour Officers of me. Whereas in truth, if the Bone be well ſet and bound up, it is not materiall whether it be any more dreſſed or no. Thus in an Army we are frequently rewarded, if we do not attend them as their meniall Servants.</p>
                     <p>One morning Mr. <hi>Faucett,</hi> Chirurgeon to his Royall Highneſſe,<note place="margin">3. Obſervat. of Reduction by the Hand.</note> ſent to my houſe, when I lived in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> to come to him into <hi>Black-friers,</hi> to help him to reduce a luxated Shoulder of a man lodged there. The head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> was fallen down into his Arm-pit. The way of Reduction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Mr. <hi>Faucett</hi> was by a Girt. We placed the man on the ground, and that part with the Boulſter under the man's Arm-pit, and put the Girt about Mr. <hi>Faucett</hi>'s Neck, who ſtood over him with his Hands upon the <hi>Scapula;</hi> and whilſt I drew the Patient's Elbow backward cloſe to his Spine, and thruſt the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> upward, Mr. <hi>Faucett</hi> raiſed up the head of the Bone with all his force, and it knapt in. The Bone being thus reduced, Mr. <hi>Faucett</hi> ſlipt the Girt off his Neck, and dreſſed up the man's Shoulder with Aſtringents and Bandage as hath been ſaid.<note place="margin">4.

                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1657. whilſt I was riding to a Noble Family in the North, I was deſired upon the Road to make a viſit to a man who had ſome days
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:95669:254"/>before put his Shoulder out of joint. I did ſo, and ſaw his Arm miſerably ſtript of its <hi>Cuticula</hi> by the Bandage which the ſeverall Bone-ſetters had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make the Extenſion by; yet the Bone lay lodged in his Arm-pit. I applied over the Arm <hi>cerat. Galeni,</hi> and gave direction to have a Coulſtaffe made ready againſt next morning, with a Wedge-like prominence in the middle of it, covered with ſoft Cloaths; and that the Bone-ſetters ſhould meet me at the Patient's houſe. The next morning we met, and having all things ready, I cauſed the Patient to be ſeated with his luxated Arm near a ſtrong Pillar, which ſupported part of a Mantle-tree; then took off the Dreſſings, and fomented and embrocated his Shoulder with Emollients; then folded a Cloath about his Arm a little above his Elbow, and faſtned a Bed-cord over that, and tied the ends of it about the Pillar, and with a Bed-ſtaff twiſted it, ſhewing one of the company how to twiſt it, and make Extenſion of the Arm by it. Then I placed the Coulſtaffe with its Wedge cloſe under the prolapſed head of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> two ſtrong men the while ſupporting the ends of the Staffe proportionably high, I ſtanding on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide with my Hands on the <hi>Scapula</hi> to draw it back, and preſſe it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to receive the head of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> and to govern the Operation, the Bone-ſetters looking on. All things being thus ready, the one twiſted the Cord, and thereby extended the Arm; the other held the Coulſtaffe firm and cloſe to his Side. During the Extenſion our Patient roared, and one Bone-ſetter called to me to forbear the Extenſion, ſaying, <hi>Why will you ſtrive againſt the Lord?</hi> and turned from us, declaring that I would kill the man. But the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> was then moving; upon which conſideration I bid the man twiſt on: and at that inſtant the Bone knapt in, and we looſened the Bandage; then dreſſed it up with <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with Bandage, and put him to Bed. There being little more required, I went on my journey.</p>
                     <p>In the year of the great Sickneſſe,<note place="margin">5. Obſervat. of Reduction by a Pulley and Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe.</note> whilſt I was in the North-country, a Gentleman ſent his Servant to me, who had ſome half a year before luxated his right Shoulder. He had been with a Bone-ſetter, who took ſome pains in ſtretching it, and made him believe he had ſet it: but upon ſight of it, I concluded it luxated, and felt the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> lying in his Arm-pit. I being then lame of my fractured Leg, and indiſpoſed with coughing bloud, adviſed the man to return to his Bone-ſetter, and tell him what I had ſaid. He did ſo, and travelled from one Bone-ſetter to another. Every one of them attempted the Reduction, and pretended they had ſet it. But the Patient returning ſtill to me with it unſet, I ſent for a Pulley, and cauſing it to be fixed to a ſtrong Poſt, and a Coulſtaffe to be held under his Arm-pit by two ſtrong people, we made Extenſion of the Arm, and reduced the Shoulder, as in the former Obſervation hath been ſhewed, without much difficulty. Then I dreſſed it up with a reſtrictive Emplaſter and Bandage as above ſaid, and he recovered the uſe of his Arm.</p>
                     <p>The deceaſed Mr. <hi>Edward Molins</hi> and my ſelf were ſent for to a Fencer who had put his Shoulder out of joint.<note place="margin">6. Obſervat. of Reduction by <hi>Gloſſoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium.</hi>
                        </note> We endeavoured to reduce it by the help of the Girt and our Hands: but he being of a ſtrong muſcular Body, we could not move it. We therefore embrocated the Shoulder <hi>cum oleo ex ped. bovinis,</hi> and dreſſed it up with <hi>cerat. dialthaeae.</hi> The next day we came prepared with a <hi>Gloſſocomium,</hi> well known to the young Chirurgeons by the name of a Commander, and reduced the luxated Bone; then dreſſed up his Shoulder as above ſaid. This foreſaid Inſtrument is frequently uſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing theſe Bones in ſtrong tough Bodies, and where the Luxation hath been of long continuance: but the uſe thereof requireth great caution, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſad Accidents have happened theregby.</p>

                     <p>Luxations from internall cauſes are for the moſt part irremediable: yet I ſhall give you a couple of Inſtances of my attempts therein.</p>
                     <p>A young Woman having been long diſeaſed with a Pain in her right Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">7. Obſervat. of luxation by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</note> with an Emaciation of that Arm, came to me recommended by Doctour <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Sen. Her Shoulder ſeemed to me luxated; but her Chirurgeon not being of that opinion, I declined the meddling with her: yet being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſolicited by ſome of her Friends, I ſent her to a Chirurgeon's houſe, who was one of the Maſters of Anatomy, whither I followed, and met ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Maſters of that Faculty there at a private Diſſection. They together viewed and felt her Shoulder, and unanimouſly concluding it luxated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Reduction of it; and having reduced it by Pulley and Coulſtaffe, dreſſed it up accordingly. But the Ligaments and Tendons were ſo relaxed, that afterward upon ſlackning the Bandage it relapſed.</p>
                     <p>A Child of about four years of age having had his left Shoulder luxated from his infancy, the Arm emaciated and grown uſeleſſe,<note place="margin">8. Obſervat. of Luxation by Conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> I being at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted did preſently reduce it by lifting up the head of the <hi>Humerus</hi> with my Fingers: but the Tendons being extreamly relaxed, the Bone ſlipt down again as ſoon as I removed my Fingers. Wherefore I ſent for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> a Truſſe-maker, and appointed him to fit the Child with a pair of Bodies ſtiffened on the lame ſide, wherein was fixt a Bar of Steel with a head like a Souldier's Reſt, which by a Screw was raiſed proportionably to ſupport the head of the <hi>Humerus.</hi> This being made, I placed a Fontanell in that Arm, and rowled up the other Arm from the Hand to the Shoulder, and braced it to his Breaſt, deſigning thereby to force Nouriſhment into the lame Arm, and neceſſitate him to uſe it. But the Child growing froward, they ſet it again at liberty. Upon notice thereof I deferred farther proceeding in the Cure, till the Child ſhould be more governable; adviſing the Parents to repeat the uſe of the former Preſcriptions of their Phyſicians as they ſhould ſee occaſion.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> which with a ſutable Cavity plaieth about it, inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon every extenſion of the Arm its utmoſt Proceſſe (called the <hi>Olecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>Ancon</hi>) in the large Cavity that is ſituate on the back-ſide of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus.</hi> In every Flexure its leſſer Protuberance plaieth into a leſſer Cavity in the exteriour part of the ſaid <hi>Humerus.</hi> The <hi>Radius</hi> meanwhile, being
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:95669:255"/>round and flat, with a very ſmall Excavation doth play upon the outer head. Theſe Heads have yet a farther uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by their reſpective Proceſſes to make a ſtation for ſeverall Muſcles: the outer Protuberance giving originall to all the Extenſors of the Hand and Fingers; the innermoſt to all the Flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the ſame. The Joint it ſelf, beſides the Ginglymoïde connexion of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> to the <hi>Humerus,</hi> is tied faſt by a ſtrong Ligament, and well bound in with Muſcles. <hi>Viz.</hi> on the inſide it is lined with the ſtrong and thick, but very ſoft, end of the <hi>Brachiaeus internus,</hi> whoſe Ligament, though hard and thick enough, yet hath a ſoft Pillow of Fleſh interpoſed between it and the Joint, that ſo the preſſure may not hinder the motion thereof, but rather give way to it. Yet is the preſſure ſtrong enough to keep the place firm, which the acceſſion of the Tendon of the <hi>Biceps</hi> doth much more corroborate; ſo do the <hi>Pronator radii teres</hi> and <hi>Supinator longus,</hi> &amp;c. The outer part is well guarded by that great ſtrong Muſcle which uſually is reckoned for two, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Biceps,</hi> and <hi>Brachiaeus externus,</hi> which uniting together have a fleſhy ſoft inſide, but with a ſtrong broad Ligament fixt on the outſide to the <hi>Olecranon.</hi> There is alſo a little Muſcle called <hi>Anconeus,</hi> which reaching from the end of the <hi>Humerus</hi> obliquely tranſverſe doth inſert it ſelf into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating the Joint.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Radius</hi> alſo is bound cloſe to the ſide of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> and to the <hi>Humerus</hi> by two remarkable Ligaments; <hi>viz.</hi> the circular one that involveth the Joint, and the broad one that uniteth it and the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> together: it is alſo bound down by the neighbouring Muſcles, eſpecially the two <hi>Supinators</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator teres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that conſidereth the figure of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> and the ſtrength whereby it is tied to the <hi>Humerus,</hi> will think the Luxation of it almoſt impoſſible: Yet even this alſo is ſometimes made by the force that may be put upon it, and that four ſeverall ways, if we may believe Authours; as ouotwardly, inwardly, and to each ſide.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be forward,<note place="margin">Signs of the Elbow luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> the Arm hangeth ſtraight out, or rather outward, and he cannot bend it; a Prominence appeareth in the Bout or inſide of it, and an unwonted Cavity where the Elbow ſhould be. But if the Luxation be backward, the Cavity will be in the fore-part, and the Arm curved. If the Luxation be on the inſide, the Cavity will be on the outſide; and ſo the contrary, if it be externally diſtorted.</p>
                     <p>The perfect Luxations of this Joint do rarely happen.<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> When they do, they are difficultly reſtored: and if there be a Fracture of any of the Proceſſes of the Joint, the caſe is deplorable.</p>
                     <p>If the Cubit be luxated forwards,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> the Arm muſt be extended, but not in a ſtraight line, leſt you break the tip of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna,</hi> but obliquely. To which end, two perſons being employed, one to hold the <hi>Humerus,</hi> the other to pull the Arm below, a third perſon muſt guide the Elbow ſo as to keep it bent, and to direct the Bone. Which is done by preſſing a Boulſter upon the bend of the Joint, or by a Girt or other Bandage pulled behind, or by one in the nature of a Stirrup, in which the Chirurgeon may put his foot, and make Extenſion that way.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be backwards, the Extenſion being made obliquely as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Repoſition is eaſily guided by the Chirurgeon's Hand. Yet ſince the extending Muſcles of the Cubit are very ſtrong, it will be neceſſary that the Muſcles ſerving the Cubit be firſt well embrocated with lenient Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but if notwithſtanding you cannot reduce it by Hand, the Ladder or other Engines muſt be uſed. And after Reduction applie Reſtrictives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe Luxations are ſubject to great Fluxion, Inflammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THE former of theſe Luxations happened to a Servant-maid in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers</hi> carrying a Pail of water. Her Feet ſlipping,<note place="margin">1. Obſervat. of a luxated Elbow.</note> ſhe endeavoured to ſave her ſelf; but falling backward, ſhe pitcht upon her right Hand, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the head of the Bone inward a great way. The poor creature was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the next houſe, being an Ale-houſe, and Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> a neighbouring Chirurgeon and my ſelf were fetched. Dreſſings being made ready, and the Wench ſeated, one of the company ſtood on the contrary ſide of her, with both his Hands upon that Arm below the Shoulder, and held her firm. Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> made Extenſion below the Cubit, and my ſelf with a boulſtered Girt upon the prominent Bone in the Bout of the Arm pulled it backward. After we had thus come to the very brink of the Joint, Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> bowing the Arm ſuddenly forward, I drew it back into the place; then embrocated it <hi>cum ol. roſ. myrtill. &amp; aceto,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> with Bandage, and left her Hand upon her Breaſt. But ſhe was lame long after.</p>
                     <p>If the Cubit-ſlip out ſide-way, the Reduction may be made by Extenſion and impulſe of the Hand.</p>
                     <p>That of the <hi>Radius</hi> is alſo reduced by the like means; ſo that examples need not be given: onely in the other of a curved Wriſt, I ſhall give one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lna</hi> cloſe to the <hi>Radius,</hi> and applied round the luxated Joint an Emplaſter of a ſtringent Powders <hi>cum album. ovi,</hi> Splints, and Bandage, as in a fractured Bone, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it on her Breaſt, and thereby reſtored it to good uſe and its naturall figure.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Carpus</hi> is compoſed of divers Bones. One lieth out of order. Three of them are joined to the Proceſſes of the <hi>Radius</hi> and <hi>

Yet theſe Bones may be all thruſt out together, or any one of them ſingle, inwardly, outwardly, alſo towards either ſide.</p>
                     <p>This Luxation is diſcovered by the Tumour it maketh in the place where it lieth diſtorted; alſo by the Flexure or Extenſion of the Fingers.<note place="margin">Signs of the <hi>Carpus</hi> luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                        <hi>Viz.</hi> if the Bones be moved inward, the Flexors of thoſe Fingers are ſo ſtretcht, that the Extenſors cannot ſtir them: and ſo contrary, if the Bones ſtart outward,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:95669:256"/>the Extenſors are immovable: and if they be luxated ſideways, the Hand leans either to the Thumb or little Finger.</p>
                     <p>The way of Reduction is,<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> to lay the Hand and that part of the Arm flat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Table, and make Extenſion above and below: during which the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon preſſeth down the prominent Bones with his Hands into their ſeverall Cavities.

The ſingle Luxation of the ſeverall Bones may be demonſtrated by their Protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and by the complaint of the Patient.

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Luxation of the Hip.</head>
                     <p>THE Joint of the Hip is a Connexion of the head of the <hi>Os femoris</hi> to the <hi>Acetabulum</hi> of the <hi>Os iſchion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deſcription of the Hip.</note> which is done by two ſtrong Ligaments: one outward and membranous, encompaſſing the whole head of the <hi>Femur,</hi> from the edges of the <hi>Acetabulum</hi> to the farther end of the neck, where it toucheth the great Trochanter: the other inward, of a round figure, like a Cord tying the utmoſt <hi>apex</hi> of the <hi>Caput femoris</hi> to the inner ſide of the <hi>Acetabulum</hi> near the center. This Articulation is confirmed and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by great ſtrong Muſcles; <hi>viz.</hi> on the outſide by the three <hi>Glutes,</hi> on the inſide by the <hi>Triceps,</hi> together with the <hi>Levidus,</hi> and the four little Rotators. All which being duly conſidered, it muſt needs follow, that the force muſt be great that doth drive this out of its place. Yet when the weight of the Body and the undue poſition of the Thigh do concur, they frequently make that Luxation: ſo likewiſe doth ſometime externall force.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that this place admitteth not of a Semi-luxation as others do; the head being ſo round, and the Cavity ſo glib, and deep, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the force be, if the head be not thruſt quite out, it will ſlip in again as ſoon as the force ceaſeth. It doth ſlip out four ſeverall ways, outwardly, inwardly, forward, and backward. Yet theſe two latter I never ſaw; but by Congeſtion the Ligaments and Tendons may be ſo relaxed, that it may fall out either way.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be inward,<note place="margin">Signs of a Hip luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> the head of the <hi>Femur</hi> may be felt round and hard a little beneath the Groin. But if the Patient be in bed, you may judge of it by turning up the cloaths at the bed's feet; the Leg will appear longer then the other, and the Knee and Foot lie turned outward. If the Luxation be outward, that Leg will be much ſhorter then the ſound one, and the Toes truned inward.</p>
                     <pb n="495" facs="tcp:95669:256"/>
                     <p>In a relaxation of the Hip, the Leg hangs for the moſt part directly down and looſe, is weak, turneth either way, and is much emaciated.</p>
                     <p>Luxations of the Hip are difficultly reduced, and being ſo,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</note> are extreme apt to prolapſe, by reaſon of the over-great Extenſion or Ruption of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ligament, which ſhould hold the Bone in its <hi>Acetabulum.</hi> And if it be not reduced, it will be ſubject to great Pain and Fluxion from the over-ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Muſcles, and preſſure upon them with its great head: yet after ſome months thoſe Muſcles become callous, and having yielded to the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Patient makes a ſhift to go upon it, though lamely. But the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuffereth an <hi>Atrophia,</hi> and is ſhorter then the other.</p>
                     <p>When the Luxation happeneth by Congeſtion, it is ſubject to Apoſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the head of the Bone corrupts by lying ſlabb'd in the Humour, and the Patient languiſhes and dies emaciated.</p>
                     <p>If the Thigh-bone be luxated inward,<note place="margin">Reduction of the <hi>Os fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris.</hi>
                        </note> and the Patient young and of a tender Conſtitution, it may be reduced by the Hand of the Chirurgeon: <hi>viz.</hi> he muſt lay one Hand upon the Thigh, and the other upon the Patient's Leg; and having ſomewhat extended it towards the ſound Leg, he muſt ſuddenly force the Knee up towards the Belly, and preſs back the head of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> into its <hi>Acetabulum,</hi> and it will knap in. For there is no need of ſo great Extenſion in this kind of Luxation; for the moſt conſiderable Muſcles being upon the ſtretch, the bowing of the Knee as afore ſaid reduceth it. Yet in tough Bodies it may require ſtronger Extenſion: and in that caſe the Patient muſt be laid upon a Table flat on his Back; and a Pin of a good thickneſs ought to be fixt in the middle of the Table, to ſtand up between his Legs cloſe to that <hi>Inguen,</hi> that the Extenſion may be made thereby. During which, the Extenſion muſt be made by two men, the one pulling him by that Arm-pit, the other by the Leg: which latter Extenſion muſt be made obliquely towards the ſound Leg.</p>
                     <p>If the Luxation be backward, he muſt be then laid upon his Belly, and the Pin placed as aforeſaid in his Twiſt: it ought to be as thick as a Rowling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, and covered with Cotton, that its hardneſs may not be offenſive. The Extenſion may alſo be made upward by a Towell or Girt between his Thighs: and the while that Leg muſt be ſtretcht by Pulleys or ſuch like ſtrength, and the Bandage faſtened above the Knee.</p>
                     <p>The Bone once reduced, dreſs it up with Reſtrictives and good Compreſſe and Bandage, then bind it to the other Leg, and keep him in bed: for theſe Bones are apt to ſtart, eſpecially if the <hi>Ligamentum teres</hi> be broken. If after Reduction and ſuch Regulation the Bone do ſtart again, I ſhould forbear any farther forcing it, to avoid the danger of Apoſtemation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, as I have ſaid, they may recover ſtrength to goe on it, though it be never reduced.</p>
                     <p>A Luxation made by Relaxation or Reſolution requireth good drying and corroborating Fomentations, Emplaſters, Epiſpaſticks, Fontanells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Habit of body ought alſo to be treated by Internalls as in the <hi>King's Evill;</hi> and if it apoſtemate, to be dreſſed as ſuch Abſceſſes.</p>

                     <p>THE Joynt of the Knee is made by the connexion of the lower head of the <hi>Femur</hi> and the upper head of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and the <hi>Patella.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deſcription of the Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt.</note> The firſt of theſe by a double Protuberance is inſerted into the double Cavity of the latter, and ſuffers conſtriction on the anteriour part from the great and large Muſcles, which running to and beyond the <hi>Patella,</hi> join that to the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> and bind it down upon the Articulation, ſo as of the whole to make a Joint. On the hinder ſide it is guarded with the two Ham-ſtrings ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tendon of the <hi>Biceps</hi> outwardly, and of the <hi>ſartorius, gracilis, ſemimembra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſus &amp; ſeminervoſus</hi> inwardly: between which, through a little Cavity made for that purpoſe, all the great Veſſells have their paſſage to the Legs. Now the Joint being thus ſtrengthned doth ſcarce admit of any Luxation forward, unleſſe the cauſe be exceeding violent. Backward and on each ſide it is ſubject to both Luxation and Semiluxation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> of the ſeverall Luxations of the Knee are apparent to the eye,<note place="margin">Signs of a luxated Knee. Reduction.</note> by the Protuberance in the one part, and Cavity on the contrary.</p>
                     <p>They are not difficult to reduce, nor ſubject to ſuch Accidents as thoſe of the Elbow.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Luxations which happen on either ſide of the Knee may be reduced by a moderate Extenſion with your Hands. The Luxation backward is reſtored by extending it a little: then bend the Leg ſuddenly backward, bringing his Heel to his Buttock, and you ſhall hear it knap in to its place. It being ſo, ſtretch it out again, and embrocate the Joints and Parts affected, and apply Aſtringents with a Compreſſe in the Ham, with good Bandage. I ſhall ſhew you the manner of reducing the perfect Luxation more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as followeth.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman of about 30 years of age,<note place="margin">Obſervation of a luxated Knee.</note> riding upon the Road ſome few miles out of Town, was by the ruſhing of a Cart tumbled with his horſe into a Ditch, and brought back to <hi>London</hi> extremely lame and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I being fetcht to him found him in bed. The head of the <hi>Os tibiae</hi> was ſhot under the Thigh-bone, and lay ſtretcht out ſtraight, exceedingly ſwelled, and much bloud extravaſated amongſt the Muſcles of the Calf of his leg. I cauſed the Patient to be laid on the contrary ſide: then one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany held him down, and kept that Thigh ſteady, whilſt I took him by the Foot and Calf of his leg: and after I had a little drawn it to me, I forced it backward towards his Buttock; by which very motion it knapt into its place. That done, I extended it again, placing the while my Hand in the Hollow of his Knee. The motion of that Joint to and fro, and the filling up that Cavity under the <hi>Rotula,</hi> were certain ſigns of its Reduction. I embroca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Leg <hi>cum albumine ov. ol. roſ. myrtill. &amp; aceto,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over all, with a Compreſſe in his Ham, then rowled it up, and laid his Leg upon a Pillow to the eaſe of the Patient. That done, I let him bloud in his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95669:257"/>Arm, preſcribed him an Emulſion of the cold Seeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and kept his Body ſoluble by Clyſters, and adviſed him a ſlender Diet. The third day I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Embrocations with the foreſaid Oils <hi>cum aceto,</hi> and thereby repelled the Humour ſo, that there onely remained ſome remarques of the extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bloud. I then embrocated thoſe Parts <hi>cum ol. cham. lumbric. ſpir. vini,</hi> and applied <hi>empl. ſtict. Paracelſ. &amp; diapalmae</hi> on the weak Joint. From the firſt application he grew daily eaſier, and by theſe latter the Joint waxed ſtrong, and he roſe and walkt with a Crutch in his Chamber: and ſome time afterwards I ſaw him walking abroad with a Stick in his hand.</p>

                     <p>THE lower end of the <hi>Tibia</hi> being joyned to the <hi>Fibula</hi> maketh a gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glymoïde Cavity in which the <hi>Os tali</hi> is inſerted:<note place="margin">Deſcription of the Ancle-bones.</note> the two Ancles being on the inſide the Product of the <hi>Os tibiae,</hi> make the outer on the <hi>Fibula.</hi> Underneath lie all the <hi>Oſſa tarſi</hi> in order; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Os calcis</hi> under the <hi>Talus,</hi> the <hi>Os cymbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi> before it. Outward of that, joyning to the <hi>Os calcis,</hi> is the <hi>Os cubiforme;</hi> and between the <hi>Os cymbiforme</hi> and the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> lie the three <hi>Oſſa cùnei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Joint is involved in ſtrong Membranes and Ligaments, and bound in by divers ſtrong Tendons: <hi>viz.</hi> behind by the Tendon of the <hi>Gaſtrocne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> and yet cloſe underneath in the Hollow of the <hi>Calcaneum</hi> by the <hi>Flexores pollicis &amp; tertii internodii digitorum lateralis;</hi> inward by the <hi>tibialis poſticus;</hi> outward by the <hi>preconei;</hi> forward by the <hi>tibialis anticus.</hi> Theſe joined to the ſtrong Ligaments that every-where bind up the Part, and aſſiſted by the figure of the Bones, do make a Joint that would not eaſily be diſlocated, did not ſo great a weight lie thereupon. But from great weight and force it ſuffereth four ways.</p>
                     <p>If the luxated Bone be diſtorted inward,<note place="margin">Signs of a luxated Ancle.</note> the Sole of the foot lieth turned outward; ſo likewiſe if the Luxation be in the exteriour part. If the Luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be forward, the broad Tendon of the Heel lieth hard and ſtretcht out, and the Foot appeareth ſhorter, becauſe the Joint is moved forward, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth moſt part of the Foot. But if the luxated Bone be diſtorted back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it lieth over the Heel-bone, in which caſe the Sole of the foot ſeemeth bigger and longer. Accordingly as theſe Signs are evident, the Luxation is perfect or imperfect.</p>
                     <p>The Reduction is not difficult;<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> yet theſe Luxations are ſubject to great Pain, and are accompanied with Tumour and <hi>Ecchymoſis,</hi> and the Patients are long lame of them.</p>
                     <p>The way of Reduction in tender Conſtitutions may be by Extenſion with your Hands, the one taking hold of the Leg, the other of the Foot.<note place="margin">Reduction.</note> During which Extenſion, the Chirurgeon muſt preſſe the Bone the contrary way to which it was fallen. In caſe the Extenſion by your Hands ſuffice not,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:95669:258"/>you may make uſe of Pulleys or other Engine. The Bone being reduced, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Reſtrictives with Bandage as above ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Ancle-bone is apt to turn out on either ſide, by reaſon of Relaxation of the Tendons: in which caſe, though you do reduce it, yet upon the leaſt walking on it the Bone ſlips out again. Some years agoe ſuch a one was brought to me; I reduced it eaſily, and it as ſoon ſlipt out again: whereupon I cauſed a Shoe to be made by which the Ancle was kept ſteady, and at length by application of Aſtringents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it recovered ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>The Bones of the <hi>Metatarſus</hi> and Toes are frequently fractured, but rarely luxated, by reaſon of their ſtrong Ligation by ſo many Tendons. But if it ſo happen, their Cure is the ſame with that of the Fingers and Hand.</p>

                     <p>LUXations of the Spine, which are moſt uſually from inward Cauſes, as in Rickety Children, alſo in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Evill,</hi> and other Tumours hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening upon thoſe Bones, require internall Remedies, ſo are referrable to a Phyſician.

                     <p>LUes Venerea <hi>is a venemous contagious Diſeaſe gotten either Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or Mediately from an impure Coition.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Definition.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay <hi>Immediately</hi> or <hi>Mediately,</hi> becauſe it is very manifeſt,<note place="margin">Ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> that not only the Perſons ſo copulating are infected, but alſo the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren derived from ſuch Parents, and Nurſes that ſuckle thoſe Children, and any other Child that ſucks upon thoſe Nurſes; and ſo forwards. It is frequent to mention other ſecundary ways of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; as lying in the ſame Bed with an infected perſon, lying in the ſame Sheets after them, or wearing their Cloaths. Nay it is affirmed by ſome, that men have been infected by the ſame Cloaths they themſelves wore when they were diſeaſed. Drinking with one ſo diſeaſed, or ſitting on the Cloſe-ſtool after them, are likewiſe numbred among the cauſes of infection.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all ſuch convenient excuſes for the more ſhie and coy Patients who will not otherwiſe be brought to confeſs their diſtempers, that it is pity to diſcountenance them. Nor will I deny the differences of Conſtitutions to be ſo great, and ſome of them ſo liable to this Diſeaſe by ſome other previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of body, that they may be infected with the tenth part of what another would eſcape ſound from. And this eſpecially I do acknowledge in Women, the ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of whoſe Sex being frequently attended with thin and ſharp <hi>ſerum</hi> in the blood, renders them liable to very quick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: yet in Men, and indeed in the generality of Patients, we find the Diſeaſe not ſo active as to conveigh it ſelf from one ſubject to another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actual coition, or ſomething very equivalent to it. And as to wearing of the ſame Cloaths, it is notorious that many hundreds cured by us Chirurgeons here in the Town, do commit that error (if it be one) without the leaſt inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. Nay in ſound and firm conſtitutions impure coition it ſelf is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſufficient to infect. Of which I have ſeen the frequent Experiment during the three years I ſerved in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Navy, where our Mariners as ſoon as their pockets were full of money would be getting aſhore to the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and other common women, that uſually attended their Landing, and ſerved their pleaſures in the neighbouring Broom which grew very plentifully on ſome of thoſe ſhores. I have known, and dare ſay, more than twenty men lay
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95669:260"/>with one and the ſame woman the ſame day, and only ſome of them infected, the reſt going free, though they all equally deſerved it.</p>
                     <p>But Nurſes may either infect Children or be infected by them. Children that have had no Ulcers in their Mouths or Lips, nor any other viſible ſymptom of the <hi>Lues,</hi> have notwithſtanding betrayed their own infection by tranſmitting it to the Niple of the Nurſe. In which caſe it is frequent to ſee ſerpiginous Ulcers ariſe one after another, growing at length into ſo many round cruſty Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: alſo Nodes thruſting out of the back of the Hands, Shins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Infections of Children are more obſcure, for though many of them after they be born have ſuch Scabs and Ulcers as do ſufficiently manifeſt the Diſeaſe, yet it is not alway ſo: for generally they do often come into the world very clear, and with the appearance of very ſound bodies, which notwithſtanding have been certainly infected and have dyed of it, or at leaſt have been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; and though they were brought to their ends by ſome other apparent Diſeaſe, yet the Pox hath been judged the foundation of all.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall give you a three-handed inſtance that may confirm ſeveral parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>A luſty young fellow brought me to ſee his Wife, which I did in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Dr. <hi>Mapletoft;</hi> we found upon her face a great cluſter of round cruſty Venereal Ulcers, yet not only her Husband was ſeemingly ſound, but her Child alſo, who being half a year old appeared luſty and ſtrong, played merrily in the Nurſes Arms, but that day dyed ſuddenly: nor could I impute that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any other cauſe, but the forementioned infection.</p>
                     <p>Yet I would not have any man raſh in judging all Ulcers to be Venereal that do reſemble them, for I have ſeen Nurſes with chapt Niples, and ſerpiginous Ulcers on the Breaſts, and Maids likewiſe in the ſame condition, who have been cured without any reſpect to the <hi>Lues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſeen alſo many Infants broken out about the Lips, Face, Head and Body, with many ſuſpicious <hi>puſtulae</hi> and Ulcers, that were born of chaſt Parents. In our publick healings we preſent many ſuch, if there be any diſeaſed glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules found about the <hi>muſculus maſtoideus,</hi> I ſuppoſing them rather to be ſtrumous.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far treated of the <hi>original</hi> of the <hi>Lues,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Its Nature.</note> it will be now ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deſcribe the <hi>Diſeaſe it ſelf.</hi> For the doing of which it will not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to run through all the nice diverſity of opinions which <hi>Sennertus</hi> and other Authours have reckoned up; ſuch an attempt would better become a Chair in the Univerſity than a Practical Treatiſe: I do only in ſhort ſay, that it is a Diſeaſe produced not by exceſs of any of the four qualities, but by the actual communication of a downright venom, which uſually affects that part of the body which it firſt toucheth, and afterwards the blood it ſelf, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which all the ſolid parts are by degrees tainted.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Species</hi> or rather <hi>Degrees</hi> of this Diſeaſe have by <hi>Palmarius</hi> been reckoned four according to the degrees of Infection.<note place="margin">Its Degrees and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms.</note> In the firſt he ſuppoſeth only the Hair to fall off without any other hurt of the body; a caſe, I doubt, very rare. In the ſecond the Skin groweth rough and ſpotted with many little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances. In the third down-right Scabs appear in the Head, Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the fourth the ſolid parts are infected, as the Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe degrees are either ill ordered, or at leaſt not juſted to the appearance of the Diſeaſes that occur in this age. Therefore I ſhall endeavour to rank the Degrees or Symptoms of it according to the events which we uſually obſerve in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when a Man hath had to do with an impure Woman, either he hath ſome heat or inflammation on the <hi>Penis</hi> with excoriation, which ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95669:260"/>ſoon after coition, and is cauſed by the affriction of a virulent humour; or elſe he finds a heat in his Urine, and in a day, two or three, a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> or iſſuing of virulent matter out of the ſeminal Veſſels through the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> This inflammation is very apt to produce excoriation and ulceration, upon which chancrous Ulcers ariſe; and ſometime when the Infection hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Inflammation neglected, it tends to a Gangreen, and Cyrſtalline Bladders ariſe, and the part mortifieth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſucceeds not; only the infection taking rather along the Cutis to the Groin, doth make impreſſion on the neighbouring Glandules, and produce a Bubo, which according to the degree of its malignancy either proves eaſily curable, or elſe improves in its venom and terminates in a Phage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denous Ulcer with jagged lips. At this time of the Diſeaſe I have ſeen many round, hard, venereal Ulcers upon the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and <hi>Perinaeum.</hi> Sometimes where none of the other ſymptomes have preceeded, a ſmall chancrous Ulcer ariſeth between the Prepuce and the <hi>glans,</hi> above or below, on one ſide, or in the entrance of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra;</hi> one while eating through it, otherwhile deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>fraenum, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Ulcers are ſometimes only corroſive, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times callous, or a calloſity without an Ulcer.</p>
                     <p>The attendance of a Chancre is commonly a breaking out all over the body like a flea biting, which terminates in various ſorts of Tetters or Ulcerous Scabs; or it may be that Puſtules ariſe in one or more places of the body, as Head, Face, Arms, Thighs or Legs, or Ulcers in the Tonſil, Palates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at the ſame time I have ſeen a Gummineſs upon the <hi>muſculus maſtoideus,</hi> drawing the neck on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>Then wandring pains begin towards night to affect either the Shoulders, Arms, Legs, or Head; ſometimes this laſt is affected alone to great exceſs. And about this time <hi>Verrucae, Condylomata, Mariſca</hi> or <hi>Ficus</hi> appear in the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex;</hi> alſo <hi>Ozaena</hi> and Ulcers of the ſpongieſt part of the <hi>Os ethmoides</hi> and griſtles of the Noſe; alſo about this time Tumours by congeſtion ariſe in the Breaſt, Arms, Legs, and become Ulcers of difficult cure.</p>
                     <p>The pains growing more fixed, <hi>Gummata</hi> or Nodes uſually ariſe and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually afflict them, but towards night grow more intolerable, and at length the Bones corrupt.</p>
                     <p>Coincident with ſeveral of theſe latter degrees are the noiſe in the Ears, Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a <hi>Polypus, Ophthalmia Fiſtula, Lachrymalis,</hi> fierce Catarrhs, Colicks, <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> and <hi>Tabes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe dreadful Symptoms have frequently poſſeſt the imaginations of ſome people, who having taken the way to get the Pox are ſoon perſwaded that they have it. Theſe men will ſtrangely imagine all the pains and other ſymptoms they have read of, or have heard other men talk of. Many of theſe hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack have come to Sir <hi>Fran. Pr.</hi> in which caſes he hath been pleaſed to ſend for me to conſider of their complaints with him. They commonly went away from us unſatisfied, nor could they quiet their minds till they found ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker that would comply with them; which done, they were never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the imagination in which the Diſeaſe was ſeated remaining ſtill uncured; whereupon preſuming they were not in hands skilful enough, they have gone to others and ſo forwards, till they had ruined both their Bodies and Purſes.</p>
                     <p>There have been three of theſe people with me lately; one a Tradeſman, who told me that ſince his Wifes death he had fallen into ill company, and being heated with drink, ſtrayed and got a Clap, for which he had been under ſeveral hands; that it had coſt him 40 pounds amongſt them, but he was ſtill worſe and worſe. I asked him if he had ever a <hi>Gonorrhoea?</hi> Yea, ſaid he, with great pain in my Back, which ſtill continues: alſo ſuch a pain in my Noſe, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95669:261"/>I fear it will fall. Upon more particular enquiry I found no ſuch thing; only upon ſtraining to make Urine or upon the Cloſe-ſtool, he had an involuntary effuſion of Seed, which was an old infirmity he had quite forgot. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſatisfie him that he eſcaped better than he deſerved. Whether he continued in the ſame opinion he ſeemed to have received from me of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I ſometime doubted, but lately have ſeen him and been aſſured, that ſince he ſpake with me he had taken no Phyſick, nor felt any cauſe for it, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing very well.</p>
                     <p>Authours upon the firſt entrance of the Pox into <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> generally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as not only incurable,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> but alſo ſo highly infectious that they ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it as much as the <hi>Jews</hi> did from a Leproſie; but Latter Ages and long experience have made it leſs formidable: yet even to this day it muſt needs be acknowledged difficult to cure, in conſideration of its malign and contagious quality, and the ungovernable diſpoſition of the Patients.</p>
                     <p>If the habit of body be ſtrong, the cure of all theſe Species of <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> whether they be Chancre, <hi>Puſtulae, Serpigo, Herpes miliaris exedens, Phagedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Ozaena,</hi> Ulcers in the Palate or Tonſils, they are all much eaſier cured than the ſame are in any other chronick Diſeaſe: but to eradicate the <hi>virus</hi> that it do not return with more malignity, is ſomewhat more difficult.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient hath been formerly clapt, it will be the more difficult to cure him the ſecond time, and worſe the third.</p>
                     <p>If he hath paſſed through long courſes of Mercurial remedies ineffectually, his cure will be difficult; and if he hath been Salivated by Unction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, the Cure will be hard, by reaſon the Mercury is become familiar to him, and his body is for the moſt part emaciated and ſqualid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gummata</hi> and Nodes are more difficult of cure than the Species above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and thoſe whoſe Bones are corrupted are yet more difficult of cure: but if the habit of body be ſtrong and the <hi>Viſcera</hi> ſound, all the ſpecies of this Diſeaſe are curable if the Patient keep his Chamber, and ſubmit to the rules of Phyſick and Dyet, without which ſubmiſſion we can ſcarce cure the leſſer Species; and accordingly as they have been ſlubber'd over, the malignity that remains will at one time or other ſhow it ſelf either in ſome Chronick Diſeaſe, as <hi>Aſthma,</hi> Catarrhe, Colick, <hi>Diarrhoea, Stranguria, Rheumatiſmus, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drops, &amp;c.</hi> or in ſome ſpecies of the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> when poſſibly the Patient will not be ſo willing to acknowledge the Diſeaſe, and what hopes is there then of his Cure?</p>
                     <p>Alſo if the <hi>Viſcera</hi> be unſound, or the Patient Hectick, a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and the Cure is impoſſible.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Remedies generally uſed in the Cure.</head>
                     <p>THE Medicines alter according to the degrees of the Malady, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances, in which the following Diſcourſes will inform you. My preſent buſineſs is to give a general view of them all, with their Natures and Uſes. Now the known Remedies, all or ſome of which we uſed in this Cure, are <hi>Bleeding, Purging, Vomiting, Salivating, Sweating,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Its Cure.</note> 
                        <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials</hi> and <hi>Opiats;</hi> to which we may add <hi>Dietetical</hi> directions, eſpecially <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Drinks,</hi> and <hi>Topicks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> though it do not cure the Diſeaſe, yet in the very beginning of it we uſually let Blood, to calm the fermenting Humours, and diſpoſe them for Evacuation, and preſcribe a Clyſter before or after.</p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe be of long continuance,<note place="margin">By Bleeding,</note> and they have been let Blood ſome months before, yet if we deſign Salivation, we do again <hi>let</hi> them <hi>Blood,</hi> if the Body be not too much emaciated. For in ſome of thoſe a Feavor hath happened in the time of raiſing the Salivation: and in Bodies of ſtronger ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits I have often ſeen them to break out in heat all over in the beginning of the Flux, ſo that then I have been neceſſitated to let them Blood when it was not ſo proper. When this Diſeaſe appeareth in the Groin with a <hi>Bubo,</hi> we do not let Blood; yet ſome have adviſed it in the Foot, as a way to lead the Humours thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purging</hi> is more univerſally neceſſary,<note place="margin">Purging,</note> few Caſes being to be put in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe where it is not required. For whoſoever is Infected, either is already Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochymical, or will quickly be ſo, if by a ſuddain evacuation of the corrupted matter you do not prevent it. It is alſo uſeful in keeping the Blood low, which the higher it is the more apt it is to be inflamed. Of Purges, ſome are only <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive,</hi> fit for weak and extenuated Perſons, alſo to diſpoſe the Body for more ſtrong Purges.

For though the other may purge ſtrongly, they of themſelves have not vertue to check the malignity even in the leſſer ſpecies of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>This I the rather add, becauſe of the wickedneſs of many Pretenders, who will in this Cure declaim againſt the uſe of Mercury, in which if they ſpeak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and follow their Judgements (and do not give it at the ſame time when they ſpeak againſt it, as many do) they will prolong their Cure to no purpoſe, and meet with diſgrace at laſt; it being very ſure, that no ſpecies of it will be cured without it. I know <hi>Fernelius,</hi> and ſome of his Diſciples writ vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently againſt it, but the whole current of the Able Practitioners have written on the other ſide. And by what I find by my experience, I dare ſay, that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> never cured a confirmed Pox without it, unleſs the Patient had been in ſome other hands before who had ſluxed him; in which Caſe ſome ſudorifick courſe preſcribed by him might get the Credit of a Cure, whoſe foundation was laid in Mercury. I write this the more confidently, becauſe of the many attempts I have my ſelf made, and ſeen endeavoured by ſome worthy late Practicers in our Faculties without Mercury, but by omitting of it, our Cures were rendered tedious and unſucceſsful, the Ulcers the while ſpreading and breaking out freſh in ſome parts while we were endeavouring to Cure them in others, the Diſeaſe becoming more fierce in ſome of them whilſt their Bodies were purged with Catharticks without Mercury. Nay, where one of thoſe Inveighers againſt Mercury gave it in a Courſe of ſeven weeks, he could not by all his endeavours of Mercurial Emplaſters, Unguents or Waters outwardly applyed, nor with his Sweating Diet-drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cure one ſmall <hi>Herpes</hi> in the Face, yet was better paid for his Phyſick than I was for the Cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vomiting</hi> is of uſe in great diſorders of the Stomach,<note place="margin">Vomiting,</note> when the foulneſs of that requires it, or when the Ulcers of ſome particular part require a ſudden revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. So likewiſe when after the uſe of much Mercury outward or inward to ſalivate, it doth not ariſe kindly, we by this means cauſe a motion upward, and derive the humour that way.</p>
                     <p>They are generally ſtrong if the party can bear them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome Preparations of Mercury, as <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> &amp;c. or. Antimonial, as <hi>Crocus Metallor,</hi> in ſtronger Bodies; but in weaker Conſtitutions we give ſuch as we may.</p>
                     <p>The next thing which offers it ſelf to our conſideration,<note place="margin">Salivation,</note> is, <hi>Salivation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which ſew great Cures are done in this Diſeaſe. Nay, when a great Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation by Salivation is not intended, we are forced to diſpoſe the humours that way by Mercury, that being ſo diſpoſed they may be rendred more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to purging and ſweating Remedies. For the truth of this, I need not produce any Authority, common experience will make it evident to you; but of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The methods of Salivating are divers, but all by Mercury; beſides which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of raiſing a Salivation, it heals, attenuates, reſolves, provokes Urine, and moves noxious Humours upwards and downwards, by which not only the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95669:262"/>more ſubtil but the more groſs and feculent excrementitious humours are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that according to its ſeveral Preparations, either inwardly given, or outwardly applyed.</p>
                     <p>Inwardly are preſcribed various Preparations of Mercury, <hi>viz. Merc. ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, dulcis, Merc. praecipitat. albus, rubr. citr. niger, viridis,</hi> &amp;c. There are alſo different Preparations of ſome of theſe, as the <hi>Turbith Minerale,</hi> the Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Mercury with Gold, <hi>Theriaca Metallor.</hi> &amp;c. They Purge, Vomit, and Salivate, or are Sudorifick, and are ſtronger or weaker in their Operations, according as they are freed of their corroſive quality. The ſtrongeſt of them are capable of being rendred ſweet, and of being diſpirited both of their Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Salivating qualities.</p>
                     <p>When we deſign Salivation by <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> we give it from 20 to 25 grains, and ſometimes to thirty, either in a ſpoonful of white bread and milk, or in <hi>conſ. roſ. rub. conſ. boraginis, confect. Alchermes,</hi> or ſome ſuch like Cordial Electuary. When we ſuſpect it may work by ſtool, we preſcribe it in <hi>Elect. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcordii,</hi> or <hi>Theriacae</hi> at night going to bed, and then it alſo ſerves to alleviate their pains, and diſpoſe them to reſt. If after the taking it 4 or 5 dayes their chops do not ſwell, it may be reaſonable to move it upward by a few grains of <hi>Turbith Minerale.</hi> Accordingly as their chops ſwell they will ſalivate. If their mouths be much ulcerated and ſweeled, the Salivation may laſt 18 or 20 dayes, during which they are to be kept warm, eſpecially about their head, neck and chops, and to drink Chicken-broth, or Poſſet-Ale.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Declination</hi> of the Flux, we preſcribe them a <hi>Decoct. Sarſa.</hi> and before it ceaſeth, we purge them with ſome Cathartick Apozeme, and proceed in the reſt, as ſhall be ſhewed in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>But the Salivating with <hi>Merc. dulcis</hi> alone will ſcarce cure the middle <hi>Species</hi> of this Diſeaſe. For though the Ulcers do cicatrize, and wandering pains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereby, yet they will return, or new puſtules will ariſe, as that Salivation declineth, or preſently after. And indeed I have found better effects by the frequent purging with it mixed with ſome good Cathartick, than by the only Salivating with it alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Merc. Praecipitatus albus</hi> may be given proportionably, as hath been ſaid of <hi>Merc. dulcis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arcanum Corallinum,</hi> as it is generally ſold in the Shops, may be given from three Grains to 5. One doſe of it preſcribed by me to a Woman Diſeaſed with <hi>Serpigo,</hi> &amp;c. vomited her often, and Salivated her twenty dayes, contrary to my intention, but cleared her skin of its foulneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Red Precipitate</hi> is alſo Vomitive, but being well waſhed may be taken as ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the <hi>White Precipitate.</hi> But ſince I practiſed here in the City, I have not uſed it. <hi>Praecipitatus viridis</hi> is alſo Vomitive, and the moſt churliſh preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mercury; the doſe is much about the ſame as that of <hi>Arcan. Corallin. Hartman</hi> preſcribed it to eight Grains.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Turbith Minerale,</hi> as it is ſold in the Shop, is a rough Medicine, but being ſomewhat dulcorated firſt procureth Vomiting, then Salivation, and is proper to make a ſudden revulſion in ſuch caſes where there is a neceſſity of giving a ſpeedy relief to an afflicted part, and contributeth to the cure of this Diſeaſe in ſuch caſes where <hi>Merc. dulcis</hi> hath not force. That which I commend to your Uſe is made out of <hi>Vigo's Precipitate,</hi> and may be given from twelve to eighteen Grains, but I rarely preſcribe it to any that have not firſt taken <hi>Merc. dulcis.</hi> It takes off nocturnal pains, and reſolves <hi>Gummata</hi> and <hi>Nodes</hi> which have not been of long continuance, and haſteneth the Cure of the moſt malign Ulcers that accompany this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercury Amalgamed</hi> with Gold doth Vomit and raiſe Salivation, but is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95669:263"/>corrected and made a Sudorifick: So the <hi>Turbith Minerale</hi> is made Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale,</hi> and <hi>Aethiops Mineralis</hi> are alſo Diaphoretical, and of their Uſe you may ſee more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurius ſublimatus corroſivus</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Aqua fontis</hi> given inwardly doth alſo raiſe Salivation and Vomiting, if the Doſe be proportioned. It is much commended by ſome Practitioners, but I never made tryal of it.</p>
                     <p>This following I have frequently preſcribed, and ſo may you if you pleaſe: ℞ <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Cinamomi, galangae, curcumae an.</hi>

                     <p>There is alſo a way of Salivating by diſſolving of <hi>Merc. ſublimat.</hi> in a Bath; the uſe and manner of making it you may ſee in the Chapter of <hi>Elephantiaſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crude Mercury</hi> is alſo frequently preſcribed internally to raiſe Salivation, and is given from one Scruple to two or higher, <hi>cum terebinth. Veneta.</hi> The Pill <hi>Barbaroſae,</hi> which is a mixture of crude Mercury with <hi>Troch. Alhand. pul. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap. diagrid.</hi> &amp;c. and is commonly called the <hi>Blew Pill,</hi> purgeth powerfully, and frequently raiſeth a Salivation. I made ſome tryal of it, but it never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my expectation; yet may Cure the leſſer <hi>Species</hi> at the long run, if the Patient keep his Chamber, and obſerve a ſtrict method in Diet, Sweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>When the <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> is grown inveterate, and affecteth the moſt ſolid parts with <hi>Gummata, &amp;c.</hi> and the habit of body debilitated and vitiated by the frequent exhibition of Mercury, it then requireth a more powerful Remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> Salivation by Unction. There are various ſorts of them publiſhed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have treated of the Cure that way; the principal Ingredient in it is Quickſilver, it is that which doth the Work, the additional Materials may be at your own choice, every one compounding them as they think fit. You have an Example of one in the <hi>Pharmacopoeia Londinenſis,</hi> under the name of <hi>

                     <p>The Unction which I have uſed for the moſt part this laſt twenty years hath been made by a preſcription of Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſier,</hi> whoſe Practice with it I had frequently ſeen with good ſucceſs. In it there is 6 ounces of crude Mercury to 16 ounces of the Materials. If you ſhall make up an Unction at that rate, you will find your curioſity in the choice of the Oyntments to mix with the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not to be ſo very neceſſary, for I have ſometimes raiſed a Salivation very well
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95669:263"/>by mixing 6 ounces of crude Mercury extinguiſhed in <hi>Terebinth.</hi> with 16 ounces of <hi>Axung. porcinae,</hi> and for Common People a prepared <hi>Axung.</hi> with an addition of <hi>Ol.

                     </p>
                     <p>In order to your farther proſecution of this courſe your Patient ought to lodge near your houſe in a cloſe warm Chamber; If the feaſon be cold the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows muſt be covered with blankets, and the bed near the fire, and incompaſſed with a ſcreen if the Chamber be large. You ought alſo to have a ſtrong healthy Nurſe, ſuch as hath been accuſtomed to the imployment, that ſhe may in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Chirurgeon know how to waſh the Patients mouth, and direct and incourage him in ſuch Rules as may be neceſſary in the time of Salivating.</p>
                     <p>The moſt proper place for Unction is a Stove, if it may be had, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can bear it; if he be weak his Bed muſt be uſed, otherwiſe for want of a Stove he muſt ſit incompaſſed with a ſcreen (as I ſaid) by the fire ſide but not too near it. If in the anointing he uſe his own hands, he may ſave his Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon much trouble, and do the work better than it can be done for him: But if other help be required, then we arm our hands with bladders or gloves, and fall to it. The old, and ſtill moſt common method adviſeth to begin at the Feet, and thence to ariſe to the Legs, Thighs, Hips, and ſo upwards on the Spine to the Neck, taking in Hands, Arms, Shoulders. The Belly ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. And indeed much of the other trouble in weak bodies may be ſpared, for in ſuch the anointing of the Legs and Arms, (or Thighs, if modeſty prevent you not) will obtain the ſame; and it is ſufficient if the Mercury mix once with the blood to ſuch a degree as to cauſe a Salivation. Whatſoever the manner of the Unction be, the parts firſt anointed ought to be covered before you proceed to the next, as the Legs with ſtockings, Thighs with trouzes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at laſt his neck be well wrapped with a napkin tacked up to his Cap round about to his ears, and faſtned before to keep his chaps warm. After this a warm Bed will be convenient, and a draught of Poſſet-drink in order to a breathing ſweat. Having ſo repoſed himſelf an hour or two, he may riſe and provide for his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which muſt conſiſt of meat of eaſie digeſtion, roaſt or boiled. To his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he may drink Beer or Ale with a toaſt, the reſt of the day he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Poſſet-drink. Unction may be repeated twice a day if you ſee cauſe. But if the chaps ſwell apace you muſt moderate your hand, and it may be quite hold it off, leſt you bring on the Salivation too faſt, and endanger the Patient: when he comes to this ſtate you muſt keep him to the uſe of Poſſet-drink and Broath, which ought to be ready in quantity. Alſo burnt Wine, <hi>aq. Theriaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be ready to prevent fainting. His mouth muſt be ſyringed with a <hi>decoct. hordei cum liquiritia, rad. altheae.</hi> &amp;c. New Milk held in his mouth, or Chicken-broath will eaſe the pain, and digeſt the ſloughs that ariſe. A rolled clout ought to be placed between his teeth to keep his Chaps from cloſing. He muſt be raiſed high in his Bed, if his weakneſs conſtrain him to it, and kept for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that his Rheum may run out and not down his throat; but if he can riſe, he will ſpit better and more plentifully. Salivations by Unctions commonly laſt 24 or 25 days, ſometimes to the 30 day.</p>
                     <p>In the height of it our work is to keep up their ſtrength; and if through Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiveneſs they ſpit leſs, give them a Clyſter that they may ſpit better, and attend the waſhing their mouths; but as the ſloughs begin to ſeparate, which will be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95669:264"/>towards the declenſion of the Salivation, preſcribe them a decoction of <hi>Sarſa, &amp;c.</hi> to drink at leaſt thrice a day; and before the ſlough's quite caſt off, purge them with ſome cathartick Apozeme made in ſome of the foreſaid <hi>decoct. Sarſae,</hi> and as they are able to eat meat, put them into a drying diet and ſweat them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth ſometimes in anointing, that their Mouths are much ulcerated, and their Breaths ſmell ſtrong, yet their Cheeks do not ſwell, nor they ſpit conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably; in which caſe forbear the anointing and conſider the cauſe of it, and if the Body be ſtrong and Plethorick, vomit them with <hi>Turbith,</hi> or <hi>infuſ. croc. metallor.</hi> but if they be weak or coſtive, adminiſter a Clyſter, and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it ariſe not, diſpoſe them to ſweat with draughts of warm Poſſet-Ale, or bathe them, for that way it will be ſometimes raiſed when by the other it will not. But if they have faintneſs or palpitation of the Heart, ſhortneſs of Breath, Fevour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> your beſt way will be to purge it off by ſome infuſ. of <hi>Sena, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>decoct. Senae Gereonis,</hi> with the addition of <hi>ſyr. Roſ. ſolut. ſyr. de Spina cervina, &amp;c.</hi> and keep up their ſpirits the while with Cordials and good Broaths. If their Lungs be oppreſt, let them blood, and preſcribe <hi>Lohochs;</hi> but if there be alſo a ſuppreſſion of Urine, or that they make but little Urine and high coloured, purge them with <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Epſom</hi> water turned into Poſſet, and quicken it with ſome purging Syrup. If by theſe ways of purging the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents remit and the Salivation riſeth, it is well; but if it do not, yet there being a colliquation made, you may by well purging, ſtrict diet, ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> obtain your end. While you are removing the above-ſaid accidents, you muſt have a ſpecial regard to the Ulcers within their mouths, for it is from the fixing of the Mercury that thoſe malign Ulcers are made, which the leſs ſenſible they are of them the more corrupt they are.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in raiſing the Salivation by Unction it paſſeth downwards by Stool, in which caſe we preſcribe <hi>Theriaca, Diaſcord. Laudanum opiat. &amp;c.</hi> which being given at night will not only ſtrengthen their Bowels, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to reſt, and incourage them to go on in the anoynting. A vomit of <hi>Turbith Minerale</hi> after the unction hath been ſomewhile uſed, doth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe the Salivation; and after it is once well raiſed, you may heighten or continue it by the application of ſome of the Emplaſters following. But if after all your endeavours to raiſe the Salivation it doth diſcharge it ſelf in a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> with great evacuation, you are then to defent the Inteſtines from the acrimony of the humours by Clyſters of Chicken broath, Milk with <hi>ol. Olivar. vitel. Ovor.</hi> leſt a dyſentery do follow. Suppoſitories of Deer Suet, or <hi>ol. Hyperici, &amp;c.</hi> caſt up with a Syringe, are proper to appeaſe the <hi>teneſmus.</hi> Inwardly we preſcribe large draughts of Chicken broath, <hi>decoct. corn. cervi uſti,</hi> Milk and Water boyled with a ſtick of Cinamon.</p>
                     <p>After the Flux is ſtopt, you muſt conſider the ſtrength of the Patient, and the quantity of the unction which was applied, and the greatneſs of the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation. If it was to the extreme weakning of the Patient, do not inſiſt long upon the thoughts of ſalivating again, but proceed with Sudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as above-ſaid; not doubting of ſucceſs in the cure. For ſuch <hi>Diarrhoea</hi>'s do for the moſt part contribute as much to the cure as if they had ſalivated.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another way of Salivating, and that is by the application of Mercurial Emplaſters about the Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were firſt deſigned I ſuppoſe for the more tender and delicate ſort of people who would not admit of the unction. There are various preſcriptions of them, whereof I ſhall offer you one, viz. ℞ <hi>Empl. Diachyl. ireat.</hi> 
                        <abbr>lb</abbr>j. <hi>Empl. de minio</hi> ℥viij. <hi>Gum. Caranae, Tacamahaccae an.</hi> ℥iv. <hi>Benzoini, Styracis, Calamitae, Succini, an.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>Styracis liquid. &amp; Balſam. Peruvianae an. q. ſ. Miſceantur ſuper ignem, deinde
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95669:264"/>amove, &amp; addantur merc. crudi</hi> ℥viij. <hi>cum terebinth. extincti, &amp; fiant magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leones.</hi> Theſe being ſpread-upon Cloth thick and applyed, you muſt then put them into a warm bed, and with a draught of warm Poſſet-drink ſweat them dayly, and treat them as hath been ſaid in the ſalivating by Unction. If it ariſe not by the firſt Plaſters you muſt apply freſh once in four or five days, and if there be occaſion you may haſten the ſalivation by a few grains of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith Mineral. I have ſometimes ſalivated perſons by theſe Emplaſters, but for the moſt part I uſe them to raiſe a Salivation, or continue it in ſuch where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it with Internals, and to that purpoſe it is of excellent uſe.</p>
                     <p>The humours being evacuated by Salivation and Purging,<note place="margin">Sweating,</note> 
                        <hi>Sweating</hi> will be neceſſary; Therefore we ſhall now ſay ſomewhat of their manner of Sweating. They may ſweat in Bed, or out of it. The <hi>Bed</hi> is proper for the weaker ſort, and there they may ſweat by Bottles of warm Water or Bricks heated and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about them, or they may ſweat under a Frame. If they ſweat with Bottles or Bricks, they muſt have many cloaths, as Blankets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to cover them cloſe, and the Bottles or Bricks may be wrapt in Napkins and applyed, accordingly as you deſign more particularly to ſweat any one part. Generally they are placed on each ſide near the <hi>axilla,</hi> the <hi>Iſchia</hi> and at the ſoles of the feet. If you ſweat with Bricks, let them be heated rather by boyling water than fire, left in the bed they burn the Patient.</p>
                     <p>The way by a <hi>Frame</hi> is this; You are to ſold a well aired Sheet four double, and lay it under the Patient, then his Shirt being ſtript off, the Frame muſt be placed over him, and a Sheet over that Frame, and as many Blankets over that Sheet, and both Sheet and Blankets muſt be brought over the end of the Frame, and be tucked down cloſe to the neck; then a pan of well burnt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal or Spirit of Wine muſt be put into the lower end of the Frame: this done ſhut the door and take care that the heat be kept in, eſpecially about the Patients neck leſt it ſtifle him. His head ought alſo to be covered warm that it may ſweat. If he took not his Sudorifick before he was placed under the Frame he may take it now; the Diet-drink muſt be warmed, and may be commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly given with a Glaſs-pipe. There is required a couple of Servants to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Patient during his being in the Frame: The one of them muſt attend him with a warm Napkin to wipe the ſweat off his Face, and to give him cloaths to rub his body, which cloaths ought to be thruſt in and taken out at the one ſide of the Frame. This Servant ought to have regard to his Maſter, that upon the leaſt complaint he may give warning to his fellow to renew the fire or take it out according as there ſhall be occaſion. The fire being removed and the ſheet next the Frame ſomewhat cool, the one of his Servants ſhall hold the cloaths cloſe to the Patients neck and ſhoulders, whilſt the other draws the Frame away. Then ſhall they both tuck the Blankets and covering cloſe to him, and give him another draught of his Diet-drink, and continue him in his ſweat half an hour or more if he can admit it; then gradually cool him and pull away the wet folded ſheet from under him; then rub him with dry cloaths and put on his ſhirt; and if he be diſpoſed to ſlumber an hour, he may; otherwiſe he may riſe and dine at his pleaſure. They commonly ſweat 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hour in the Frame, and an hour in Bed after the Frame is pulled away.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ways of ſweating in <hi>Bed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ways of ſweating out of Bed are by <hi>Stove, Tub, Chair</hi> or <hi>Cradle.</hi> The <hi>Stove</hi> is the moſt eaſie in regard they may ſit, ſtand or walk up and down; but when they go out of them to bed the danger is in taking cold, whence new pains do ſometimes ariſe. Therefore thoſe Stoves that are near to a good bed are beſt; the other which you muſt go up or down ſtairs to, are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Tub</hi> and <hi>Chair</hi> were the old way of ſweating, but if the Patient
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95669:265"/>ſwounds in either of them, it will be troubleſom to get him out; poſſibly he breaks his ſhins, if he did not hang ſome while by the neck before they got him out. To avoid which they muſt take them out upon the leaſt complaint of fainting, and have ſome Cordial to relieve their Spirits.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Cradles</hi> they are ſubject to accidents by the disjointing of the Frame or breaking of the Girts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in every of theſe I have ſweat my Patients with much ſafety, and ſo may you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bathing</hi> is of great uſe in the cure of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Bathing,</note> whether it be new or old. In the recent it ſerves to contemperate the great heat and acrimony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, eſpecially in the <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſqualid and drie bodies where the <hi>Lues</hi> hath been long confirmed, Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neceſſary to humect and rarifie the humours and diſpoſe them to ſalivate. They are alſo proper after the Patient hath paſſed through the ſtrict courſe of Salivating, Purging, Sweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The body being thereby dried and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, is hereby cooled, moiſtned and reſtored to its natural temper.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Bathing we generally let Blood and Purge, if there be <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora;</hi> but in poor emaciated dry bodies a Clyſter may ſerve, or their bodies may be kept ſoluble by a lenient Bolus of <hi>Caſſia, Manna, Syr. Violar. &amp;c.</hi> and before the Patient enter into the Bath he may drink a draught of Caudle or Broath, and in the Bath he may take a ſpoonful or two of Harts-horn Jelly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Veſſel we bathe in is a Tub, wherein he may ſit up to the neck. For want of ſuch, a Barrel may ſerve, the one end being beat out and a Stool placed in it to ſit upon. The Bath Liquor is according to the occaſion and quality of the Patient, ſometimes it is all Milk, othertimes Milk and Water, or only Water, with a Bag of wheaten Bran, which ſerves the Patient as a Cuſhion, and makes the water milky. They are ſometimes perfumed with <hi>Lig. Caſſiae, Rhod. ſant. citrini, Calam. aromat. Junc. odorat. flor. Roſ. damaſc. &amp;c.</hi> The Baths of Milk are apt to ſour, therefore ought to be renewed daily, the other will laſt longer ſweet. In the time of Bathing there ought to be plenty of hot and cold water to continue the Bath of a moderate temper, neither too hot nor cold. Some Hoops ſhould be faſtned over the head of the Tub, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Blanket or Sheet as a Canopy may be caſt, in caſe the Air be cold. A Servant or two ought alſo to be attending in caſe of fainting, leſt he ſink into the water. Therefore upon his complaint raiſe him up, and caſting a ſheet about him put him into a warm bed, where he may refreſh himſelf, and at his leiſure ariſe and cloath himſelf, and dine or ſup as his Appetite requireth. They may bath twice a day, but never upon a full Stomach.</p>
                     <p>During the Cure of this Diſeaſe it will be requiſite that the Patient keep his Chamber, and that it be made temperately warm; The taking of Phyſick and rambling abroad in the cold being extremely prejudicial to their Cure, and is frequently attended with a <hi>diarrhoea,</hi> or noiſe in their Ears with deafneſs. There is alſo a ſpecial care to be taken concerning their <hi>Diet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Diet,</note> that on thoſe days they purge, their Dinner be of good nouriſhment, boiled or roaſted. We alſo allow them good Broath, and Beer or Ale to raiſe their ſtrength, ſo as they may be able to bear the evacuation which is required. But in the time of their ſweating we confine them to a very ſlender and drying Diet, only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport their Spirits. A chop of a neck of Mutton, or two Ribs dry roaſted was the old ſtint. I permit them to make choice of ſome one ſort of meat and keep them to that, which amongſt the better ſort is a Partridge, and that without ſauce. Their ſuppers may be Bisket, Raiſons of the Sun and a few blanched Almonds, and their drink <hi>decoct. Sarſae, &amp;c.</hi> But in weak and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated bodies <hi>China</hi>-Broths, or a mixture of Milk with their Diet-drink may be neceſſary.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:95669:265"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exerciſe</hi> is of uſe in the beginning of this Diſeaſe, and may ſerve to rowze the Native heat to thruſt forth the malignity and waſte ſuperfluities. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Diſeaſe is more confirmed, violent Exerciſe is hurtful, exhauſting the Spirits too much, and renders them leſs able to reſiſt the Malignity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sleep</hi> is allowed in the day to refreſh them, they being for the moſt part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in the night by their pains, which are therefore called <hi>Nocturnal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the time of Salivation they muſt ſleep when it affects them. To ſleep alſo after Bathing and Sweating is neceſſary to refreſh them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venery</hi> ought to be avoided during their courſe of Phyſick, it being one main cauſe of the unſucceſsfulneſs of it: Yea, the very thoughts of it is deſtructive to their healths; nay, though he believe himſelf Cured I would not have him over-confident that way, till he hath paſſed a Spring or Autumn. For if he be married, and bed with his Wife, and afterwards relapſe, he may poſſibly fancy that ſhe infected him; which may not be unlikely, if he bedded with her before he entred into Cure. However it was, the conſequences of it may be very ill, and may cauſe a loathing in him of her Bed, when it's poſſible he was not well Cured, and would have relapſed with a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> or <hi>Chancre,</hi> though he had not touched any Woman.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>paſſions of the Mind</hi> ought to be calmed, and the Patient to be well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the Integrity and skill of his Phyſician or Chirurgion, that he may the more chearfully ſubmit to the Rules preſcribed in order to his Cure.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Specificks in this Diſeaſe.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IN the former Diſcourſe I have had occaſion to ſpeak of the</hi> Deococt. Sarſa. &amp;c. <hi>as ſudorificks. Indeed thoſe kind of Decoctions are the great hinges on which the Cure depends, as being ſuppoſed to contain in them beſides the Sudorifick Vertue other Specifick qualities. Which appropriation of ſome Simples to the Diſeaſe more than others makes it neceſſary, before I proceed any further, to diſcourſe of the nature of theſe Specificks, which I reduce to three heads,</hi> viz. <hi>either</hi> Vegetable, Antimonial <hi>or</hi> Mercurial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Vegetables <hi>are uſually reckoned theſe;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Specificks,</note> guaiac. lign. &amp; cort. lign. ſaſſafras. rad. china, ſarſaparilla, ſaponaria. <hi>Of theſe all but</hi> ſaponaria <hi>are known Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, and may be eaſily ſuppoſed to perform all that is pretended to by them by that only faculty, unleſs we pleaſe to add dulcification. Whether</hi> Saponaria <hi>be a Sudorifick I know not; nor indeed whether ever it cured the Pox otherwiſe than in conjunction with the former Specificks and ſo any other Herb will do it.</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reola <hi>is in the Weſt of</hi> England <hi>much commended. I ſuppoſe what it doth is only by ſtrong purging, and when it is mixed in Diet-drinks, it ſerves to keep the Body open. What other Vertue it hath I know not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Antimony <hi>and</hi> Mercury <hi>are Medicaments of ſo large a compaſs, that they take in all the intentions of Phyſick. Hence we have Vomits, Purges, Sudorificks, Salivations. Vomiting and Purging are certainly of great uſe in this Diſeaſe; ſo is alſo Sweating, which is very effectually procured by ſeveral preparations of both theſe,</hi> viz. Ceruſſa Antimon. diaphoret, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bezoard. Minerale, Aethiops Mineral. <hi>&amp;c. They have the vogue of exceeding other Medicines both by their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95669:266"/>ſtrength and power of dulcification. And therefore it is that in purging alſo we make ſo much uſe of Mercurial preparations. But that Mineral hath alſo another faculty more eminent than all theſe, ſo peculiar to it ſelf, that we find not yet any other medicine, Mineral, Vegetable or Animal that can imitate it, and that is Salivation; by vertue of which it melts down the ſerum of the blood, and with it all the acid venom contracted in it by this diſeaſe, bringing it away by the mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe are the ſo highly commended Specificks of which the former are the conſtant Ingredients of the decoction to be taken during the whole Courſe, but are accommodated to the Palate and other neceſſities of the Patient by the addition of other Simples. Mercury is alſo boiled either crude or prepared: So is Cinnabar and crude Antimony: which practice I have declined, and therefore I ſhall not ſay more of it. I ſhall only proceed to inform you how to mix other Simples with theſe already mentioned as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt therefore for aromatization we add</hi> ſem. aniſi, foenic. dul. coriand. cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus aromaticus, lig. Aloes, caſſia; <hi>for other gratefulneſs</hi> Liquoriſh, Raiſins, Ivory, Harts-horn. <hi>In complication of Diſeaſes if the Head be affected, we add</hi> Betony, Sage, Roſemary. <hi>If the Breaſt,</hi> adianth. tuſſilago, ſcabioſa, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubium, Hyſſop, Figs, Dates, Sebeſtens, Jujubes. <hi>If the Heart,</hi> rad. angelicae, borag. Violets, Balm, ſcorzonera, ſcordium, Clove-gilly-flowers, Saffron. <hi>If the Stomach,</hi> Wormwood, Agrimony, centaur. card. benedict. <hi>If the Liver,</hi> Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, Turmerick, Liverwort, Succory, Dock-root. <hi>If there be Dropſie joined with it, then</hi> Briony <hi>of both ſorts,</hi> Spurge, Laurel, Eſula. <hi>For the Spleen,</hi> Dodder, Fern, Capers, Tamarisk, Spleenwort, Germander, Calamint, Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, &amp;c. <hi>In the diſeaſes of the Kidneys,</hi> the five opening roots, <hi>alſo</hi> rad. althaeae, gram. ruſci, alkekengi, eryngii, the cold ſeeds, &amp;c. <hi>If Colicks infect the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> bacc. laur. juniperi, Galangal, Zedoary, &amp;c. <hi>Then there are the</hi> greater <hi>and</hi> leſſer Scorbuticks, <hi>alſo</hi> rad. bardanae &amp; petaſitidis, <hi>which are believed to have vertue to mitigate pain in the membranes of the bones, and reſolve nodes; alſo</hi> rad. caryophyllatae, conſolidae, biſtortae, tormentillae, <hi>and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are thought proper to be added to Decoctions, and to medicate Ale or Hydromel. All which ſeveral forms of Medicines may be varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeveral intentions. In weak Stomachs we add Wine to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions. In emaciated bodies Milk. Of the <hi>Sarſa</hi> decoctions I ſhall for the eaſe of the young Chirurgeons, ſet down ſome particular preſcriptions, ſuch as I have ſeen preſcribed by worthy Phyſicians, and have practiſed with my ſelf ſucceſsfully.</hi>

The method of Cure I have propoſed by Internals will enough contribute to the Cure of all the External ſymptomes; ſo that only which is required from us, will be the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fluxion till our Internal Remedies have taken place.</p>

If this prove too ſharp, dreſs them with the former decoction.</p>

I fomented the <hi>penis</hi> with red wine, and applyed pledgets of lint preſſed out of the ſame on the excoriation, and <hi>unguent. album camphorat.</hi> over all, leaving a paſſage for urine. Then let him blood in the arm about ten ounces. A Clyſter was adminiſtred ſome hours after, and that night at his going to bed I ſent him a <hi>Bolus</hi> of. <hi>conſ. roſ.</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>mer. dul.</hi> ℈j. and purged it off the next morning with <hi>Manna</hi> in Poſſet-drink, and dreſſed him the ſame morning with <hi>decoct. plantag. ſummitat. rubi, equiſeti, &amp;c.</hi> By this method of dreſſing, and by the repeating the uſe of the <hi>mer. dul.</hi> alone, and with purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, I dryed up the ulceration and inflammation, leaving the prepuce lax as formerly. I had thoughts of preſcribing him a longer courſe, but he continued well without it.</p>
                        <p>Another came to me with an inflammation of the prepuce,<note place="margin">2. Obſervation.</note> it was ſwelled over the <hi>glans,</hi> and by the quantity of fetid matter which diſcharged I ſuppoſed a Gonorrhea, at leaſt a great excoriation between the prepuce and <hi>glans.</hi> I fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it with <hi>decoct. plantag. ſummit. rubi, equiſeti,</hi> &amp;c. and injected ſome of it with a Syringe, and lapped a ſtupe about it, and continued that method of dreſſing it twice a day; ſometimes adding a little <hi>mel Aegyptiac.</hi> to the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I alſo let him blood, and repeated the method of purging, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obſervation, till I had healed the ulceration, and relaxed the ſwelling. Then returning back the prepuce, and obſerving that the fetid matter had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from an excoriation between the prepuce and <hi>glans,</hi> I diſmiſſed him without putting him into other courſe of Phyſick.</p>
                        <p>One came to me with an Inflammation and great ſwelling of the <hi>glans</hi> and prepuce, this latter being turned back in <hi>coitu</hi> ſtraitned the <hi>glans,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">3. Obſervation of inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the prepuce.</note> and haſtened thoſe accidents of inflammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would ſoon have gangrened in ſpite of all applications. To prevent which, I prepared to divide that part of the prepuce which made the ſtricture. It was not eaſie to find the way to it, by reaſon of the inflation of the upper tunicle; but having paſſed a director under it, I cut through the ſtricture, and gave liberty to the <hi>glans,</hi> then fomented the diſeaſed parts with the <hi>decoct. plantag. &amp;c.</hi> and rouled a hot ſtupe over it, then let him blood, and treated him as venereal. The next day I found the ſwelling diſcuſſed, and the prepuce lye flaccid and natural; the wound cured in the skin a few days after by the common applications. This turning back of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce is frequently ſeen in young Lads, who wantonly handle it. Sometimes it happeneth in Conjugal Rites, and not being returned ſoon over again, it ſtraitens the <hi>glans,</hi> and accordingly haſtens the accidents of inflammation. The Cure is effected by timely fomenting with emollients; but if that way fail, you muſt divide the prepuce as aboveſaid. In ſome of thoſe who have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce very ſhort, the <hi>fraenum</hi> is alſo ſo ſtrait, that upon the erection of the <hi>Penis,</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95669:269"/>the <hi>Glans</hi> is pulled downwards, ſo as they cannot endure coition. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is by cutting the <hi>froenum</hi> in pieces. If you ſuſpect that the divided ends may be troubleſom, clip them off at the ſame time, then put a doſſil of dry Lint cloſe between the <hi>Glans</hi> and that part of the Prepuce to prevent the coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
                        <p>A young fellow came to me with the Prepuce inflamed, and a mortification on the upper part of it,<note place="margin">4.

Galeni &amp; albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ovi,</hi> the next day I gave him a Lenitive <hi>Bolus,</hi> which purged him mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. In the making extirpation of the Prepuce I had permitted him to bleed freely, and by the Lenient purge his body was cooled, ſo that at the next opening I found the Sore digeſting. I dreſſed it with <hi>digeſt. ex terebinth.</hi> and the excoriation about the <hi>Glans</hi> with <hi>unguent alb. camph.</hi> The day after I purged him again with the ſame Lenitive and <hi>calomel.</hi> By the reiterating of thoſe purgations he was freed of the malignity. The <hi>Penis</hi> was cured by the common applications in ſuch caſes propoſed in the method of cure.</p>
                        <p>One coming to me with a Chancre on the outſide of the Prepuce with <hi>callus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">5.

After the application of the Precipitate 2 or 3 times, I dreſſed the Chancre only with a Pledget preſſed out of <hi>aq. calcis,</hi> by which, with the help of the Internals, it was ſoon cicatrized and the <hi>calluus</hi> reſolved. The reliques of the Diſeaſe which I ſuppoſed to be lurking in the body I carried off by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uſe of the Antivenereals, and concluded the courſe with <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A man of about 26 years of age,<note place="margin">6.

I dreſſed it with <hi>lac ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati.</hi> I let him blood and purged him with an infuſion of <hi>ſena, rhab. &amp;c.</hi> in a <hi>decoct. tamarind.</hi> with <hi>ſyr. de ſpina cervina,</hi> and <hi>ſyr. ex infuſ. roſ. cum agarico.</hi> The ſame night after his firſt ſleep he took ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>conſ. cichorei,</hi> and the next morning I purged it off with ſome of the former infuſion.

                           <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>mer. dul.</hi> ℈j. and from that day purged him proportionably as his ſtrength would bear, increaſing or diminiſhing the one or other of them ſo as to avoid making his chaps ſore. The Ulcer being thus cured and no hardneſs remaining, I then preſcribed him a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> and deſigned the ſweating of him; but he finding himſelf well thought it unneceſſary, and did not drink four quarts of his Diet-drink, yet continued without relapſe.</p>
                        <p>One of about 40 years of age of a groſs body had a ſmall Chancre on the left ſide of the <hi>Glans,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">7. Obſervation.</note> I ſprinkled it with <hi>mer. praecipit.</hi> and applyed over it a pledget of <hi>unguent. diapomphol.</hi> then let him blood, and the next day purged him with <hi>pul. cornichini</hi> ℈ij. which gave him 14 or 15 ſtools. The day after I purged him again with <hi>pul. cornichini</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>mer. dul.</hi> ℈j. I dreſſed the Chancre with a ſolution of <hi>mel Aegyptiac.</hi> in a little of the <hi>decoct. plantag. equiſet. &amp;c.</hi> upon Lint, and left ſome of it with him to dreſs himſelf daily. I alſo left with the Patient ſome papers of <hi>pul. cornic.</hi> with and without <hi>calomel.</hi> which he took interchangeably. He had a ſtrong body, and being pleaſed with the working of the Phyſick he took it daily, and many days after the Chancre was cured, and the hardneſs reſolved: but the weather growing cold he neither drank his Diet-drink, nor ſweat; nor in truth did I think it ſo very neceſſary.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95669:269"/>A month or two after he ſhewed me a round cruſty Ulcer riſe upon his Arm, and ſuch another upon his Thigh and Breaſt; I let him blood and repeated purging, and by 3 doſes of <hi>Turbith Mineral</hi> given at diſtant times, purging him between each doſe, I avoided the making his chops ſore, and dryed the Ulcers, and by a courſe of Diet-drink and Sweating ſecured him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing.</p>
                        <p>A man of about 36 years of age came to me with ſome ſmall corroſive little Ulcers on the <hi>Fraenum,</hi> and on each ſide of it;<note place="margin">8. Obſervation of a Chancre in <hi>

I let him blood ſoon after, and gave him that night ℈j <hi>calomel.</hi> and purged it off the next day with an infuſ. of <hi>Sena, &amp;c.</hi> For the more ſpeedy relief of the <hi>fraenum</hi> I gave the next morning ℈ſs. of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith Mineral;</hi> it vomited him thrice: after which I gave him a draught of the infuſ. of <hi>Sena,</hi> and purged it downwards. By this I checked the eroſion in the Ulcers, but the <hi>fraenum</hi> was ſo far fretted, and withal ſo painful, that I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it, and with the Vitriol ſtone rubbed the broken ends thereof, and continued dreſſing it as aboveſaid, and by frequent repetition of Antivenereal purgatives, I cicatrized thoſe Ulcers about the <hi>fraenum.</hi> The Ulcer within the <hi>urethra</hi> healed alſo much about the ſame time. The <hi>callus</hi> on the top of the <hi>glans</hi> joining to it was a longer work, but was reſolved by the ſaid way of purging: after which I put him into a ſtrong decoction of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> and ſweat him with <hi>antimon. diaphoret. &amp;c.</hi> purging him with <hi>pil. cochiae min.</hi> and <hi>praecipitat. alb.</hi> every fourth day, by which courſe I confirmed his cure.</p>
                        <p>A young fellow whom I had cured of a Chancre between the <hi>Glans</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce,<note place="margin">9. Obſervation of Chancre with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and was putting him into a courſe of Diet-drink and ſweating, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome extraordinary buſineſs for two or three days, in which time he came to me with an inflammation and excoriation of the <hi>penis,</hi> with a ſmall ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the top of the <hi>glans,</hi> and would have imputed it to my not having well cured him: but its recency with the inflammation demonſtrated ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was a new Clap, and I was obliged to him that he came to me again for cure. Others of his metal have not been ſo kind. I repeated venaeſection, and dreſſed him with the <hi>decoct. plantag. ſummitat. rub. &amp;c.</hi> as it is ſet down in the method of cure, and purged him with <hi>pil. ex duobus &amp; calomel.</hi> increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diminiſhing the one and the other to avoid the making his chops ſore: then by a courſe of Diet-drink, ſweating and purging finiſhed the cure.</p>
                        <p>One of about 36 years of age came to me with the Prepuce inflamed and ſwelled over the <hi>Glans,</hi> the end of the Prepuce being carnous,<note place="margin">10. Obſervation of Chancres and Ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and contracted ſo cloſe, that I could ſcarce get in my Probe. The <hi>glans</hi> felt hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and much fetid matter diſcharged from between it and the Prepuce, which certainly demonſtrated Chancres and great ulceration of ſome continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He had alſo ſwelled Glandules in both his Groins. I fomented the ſwelling with <hi>decoct. malvae, tap. barbat. ſem. lini, foenugraeci, &amp;c.</hi> and injected the vulnerary decoction with <hi>unguent. Aegyptiac.</hi> and put in a ſhort tent of <hi>rad. gentianae</hi> dipt in <hi>oleo lilior.</hi> into the contracted Prepuce, with directions that he ſhould put in a freſh one ſo often as he ſhould urine, or ſyringe himſelf. To which purpoſe he had many prepared bigger and leſſer. That day I let him blood, and directed a Clyſter, and purged him the next morning with <hi>pil. cochiae min. &amp; merc. dul.</hi> and repeated the ſaid Phyſick according to his ſtrength, proportioning the <hi>merc. dul.</hi> ſo as to avoid ſalivating. By this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and by his courſe of Diet with <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> the Ulcers healed, and the carnoſity reſolved; but the entrance into the Prepuce continuing narrow, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95669:270"/>paſſed in a pair of probe ſciſſors as high over the <hi>glans</hi> as the narrow entrance would admit; then pulling back the exterior tunicle I cut the inner ſtraitened coat, till I had ſo inlarged it that it turned back. That done, I applyed my Reſtrictives upon the wound and rouled them on, leaving the <hi>glans</hi> only cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the circumvolutions of the rowler. The third day after I dreſſed it again, and ſaw the wound digeſting and healed in ſome parts, I dreſſed it with the <hi>digeſt. ex terebinth. cum vitello ovi,</hi> and applyed a folded linnen dipt <hi>in albumine ovi</hi> over it, and rowled it as before. I afterwards cured the wound with <hi>unguent. tutiae,</hi> and then permitted the prepuce to return to its place. In this caſe I have ſometime made two or three ſtitches at equal diſtance, by which the lips have been ſooner united. In thoſe where the prepuce is not retained back, the wound cureth and leaves the prepuce deformed and troubleſome in coition, upon which account I circumciſed one lately that came out of other hands. You ought to be careful in the dreſſing ulcerations between the <hi>glans</hi> and prepuce; for it ſometimes happeneth, that they grow together, yea, in ſuch caſes the very entrance into the <hi>

                        <p>A poor Gentleman ſuppoſing his difficulty in urining proceeded from the Stone,<note place="margin">11. Obſervation.</note> ſilently endured it till the urine was in a manner ſuppreſſed: then I was fetcht, and ſaw the prepuce ſtretched over the <hi>glans,</hi> and the entrance into it carnous, and ſcarce wide enough to admit of a probe. I made a dilatation by a ſmall pair of Plyers, then paſſed in a probe, but could neither get into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> nor paſs conſiderably between the <hi>glans</hi> and prepuce. The work requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diſpatch, therefore having drawn out the interior tunicle, and thruſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the external one, I cauſed my Servant to make a Ligature upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce cloſe by the end of the <hi>glans,</hi> and with a knife cut off the hard carnous end of the prepuce. I thought to have turned it back, but found the interior coat of the prepuce firmly grown to the <hi>glans</hi> round, as if it had been one body, and the entrance into the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> almoſt quite cloſed up by a hard <hi>cicatrix.</hi> I brought the inciſed lips of the coats of the prepuce together, and retained them ſo round by a few ſtitches; then having wiped away the blood with a ſpunge, I made an apertion through the <hi>cicatrix,</hi> inlarging the entrance of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and gave way for his urine; then put in a piece of a ſearching Candle to keep the paſſage open. I dreſſed up the prepuce with <hi>pul. Galeni</hi> upon pledgets of lint dipt <hi>in albumine ovi,</hi> and brought a fold of linnen over it, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſſage for urine. That afternoon I took out the wax-candle, and put in a leaden pipe, which was eaſily retained for diſcharge of urine, and the while cicatrized the apertion there. The wound in the prepuce being digeſted and cicatrizing, I cut out the ſtitches. This Perſon piſſed out ſeventeen piples in few days after. Infants are ſometimes born without this apertion, in which caſe if it be not ſpeedily made, the urine makes its way through ſome part of the <hi>ductus,</hi> or the Infant dieth miſerably.</p>
                        <p>A young Blade was commended out of the Country to a Phyſician here,<note place="margin">12. Obſervation of Chancre, and Glands in both Groins.</note> who committed him to my Care. The prepuce was ſwelled and inflamed, between it and the <hi>glans</hi> there were many Chancres, as I ſuppoſed by the hardneſs I felt, and by the diſcharge of fetid matter, and from thence I judged the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſwelling in the prepuce to ariſe. The Glandules in both his Groins were ſwelled. To have waited for ſuppuration in theſe had certainly cauſed the putrefaction of the other diſeaſed part, it being then in great danger through the ſo long concealing of it. Wherefore I began with fomenting and ſyring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with the <hi>decoct. plantag. ſummitat. rubi,</hi> &amp;c. with an addition of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>Aegyptiac.</hi> to ſix ounces of the decoction, and continued the dreſſing of him with that twice a day. The Phyſician preſcribed him a Clyſter that night, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95669:270"/>the next morning we let him blood in the Arm, and purged him the day after with <hi>extract. Rudii &amp; calomel.</hi> and the next day repeated a Clyſter. The day after he was purged again with <hi>extract.

By this method the Glandules in his Groins reſolved, and the Chancres cured: the calloſity alſo on the <hi>glans</hi> and end of the prepuce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and became naturally lax as before. Then we kept him ſtrictly to his Diet-drink, and ſweat him in a wicker-chair with <hi>Antimon. diaphoret. gum. guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aci,</hi> and a warm draught of his Decoction, and purged him every fourth day with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo proceeded to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> Thoſe days he ſweat he dined upon a roaſted Partridge, and at night was allowed Bisket and Raiſons of the Sun; and when he purged he dined upon boiled meat and drank ſmall Ale. During the whole courſe he kept his Chamber, and by ſo doing was perfectly cured without making his Chaps ſore in the leaſt.</p>
                        <p>A young Woman was put into my hands,<note place="margin">13. Obſervation of Inflammation and Chancre <hi>in pudendo.</hi>
                           </note> having a great inflammation and ſwelling <hi>in pudendo,</hi> with a large round Chancre between the <hi>ductus urinarius,</hi> and the interiors of the <hi>vagina uteri,</hi> with great excoriation of the parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. I let her blood, and the next day purged her with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae</hi> in a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct. caſſiae</hi> and <hi>tamarind.</hi> with <hi>ſyr. de ſp. cervina,</hi> &amp;c. and ſent her the while a pint of the <hi>decoct. plantag. ſummitat. &amp;c.</hi> to ſtupe and ſyringe the diſeaſed part, which ſhe continued the uſe of till ſhe was cured. The day after her purging, I gave her 12 grains of <hi>turbith min.</hi> which vomited her often, and purged her thrice. That afternoon a Clyſter of Milk and Sugar was adminiſtred, and the next day ſhe took another Clyſter. The Flux continuing on the parts I gave her gr. viij. <hi>turb. min.</hi> with <hi>conſ. roſ. rub.</hi> in the form of a Pill, it vomited her more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. A Clyſter was again adminiſter'd that evening. The next morning I found her more eaſie. I then purged her with the former <hi>infuſ. ſenae</hi> the two following days, by which I prevented the ſwelling of her Chaps. During this the excoriation dryed, and the Chancre was diſpoſed to Cure. From that time I purged her with the Extract ſet down in the method of Cure, adding to each doſe ℈j. more or leſs of <hi>praecipitat. albus,</hi> by which method ſhe was cured in few days. I then put her into a ſtrict courſe of Diet and Sweating, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confirmed the Cure. I ſhall forbear giving many inſtances of this Sex, in conſideration that there is little difference in the Cure, only theſe are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fluxion, and ſo require more powerful revulſion, and that your To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks be more drying, leſt excreſcences ariſe upon the excoriated parts.</p>
                        <p>A Man aged about 38 years, of a plethorick body,<note place="margin">14. Obſervation of Chancre, with carnoſity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce.</note> came to me with the prepuce contracted cloſe over the <hi>glans,</hi> it was carnous and hard, eſpecially on the right ſide, under which part I ſuppoſed there lay a Chancre. I concluded it venereal, but he not acknowledging it, I preſcribed him <hi>pil. coch. min.</hi>

The foreſaid Pills working agreeably with him, he was ſupplyed with more of them, and drank a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> between while, and took his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired liberty of walking abroad. By this method he ſenſibly perceived the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity reſolve, and was ſatisfied that I could cure him if he pleaſed, but was thereby rendered the more ſecure, and careleſs in taking that preſcribed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; ſo that after the ſpace of three weeks, when he came to me again he had many ſcabs on his head, <hi>herpes</hi> on his face, and other ſort about his thighs and arms, and the calloſity not much leſſened on the <hi>penis.</hi> At ſight whereof I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to let me know his Lodging, which being at laſt granted, I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95669:271"/>ſent him 12 gr. <hi>Turbith min.</hi> and purged it off that Afternoon with a draught of Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſier's Potus amarus.</hi> I repeated the <hi>Turbith</hi> once in three days, and gave him the bitter decoction between. Thus I dryed the Ulcers, and they ſhell'd ſoon off: The calloſity alſo reſolved eaſily, and the prepuce relaxed and turned back: yet ſome <hi>Callus</hi> remained a longer time upon the inner tunicle of the prepuce; but by Diet-drink, Sudorificks, and repeating the Vomit or Purgative Pill once in four days, he was in ſix weeks perfectly cured.</p>
                        <p>Now leſt you may think I am too ſtrict in giving ſo many Internals in the Cure of ſo ſmall an Ulcer as a Chancre,<note place="margin">15. Obſervation of Calloſity.</note> or rather a Chancrous <hi>Callus.</hi> I ſhall give you one inſtance, and the only one that I ever failed in the Cure of. It was in the year 1654. an Apothecary ſince deceaſed, engaged a Phyſician and my ſelf in the Cure. The Chancre was of the bigneſs of a cherry-ſtone ſeated on the neck of the <hi>glans;</hi> the Phyſician preſcribed <hi>Pil. Rudii &amp; mer. dul.</hi> to be given every other day, and a <hi>decoct. ſarſa. &amp;c.</hi> as it is uſually made with its additional ingredients. Thoſe Mornings he did not purge, he was to take ℈j. <hi>Antimon. diaphoret. in cochl.</hi> 1. <hi>ſyr. limon.</hi> He having thus preſcribed a method of Cure, the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary proſecuted the courſe, and indeed there was little for me to do; but the Patient deſiring my daily attendance, I dreſſed him with a pledget dipt in <hi>lac ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limat.</hi> a medicament not inferiour to any in ſuch a caſe. The firſt 14 days we paſſed on very ſecure, not doubting ſucceſs, but from that time obſerving the <hi>Callus</hi> not to reſolve as I expected, I began to enquire into the Patients man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diet, and into the Phyſick he took. As to his Diet, he lodged in the Apothecary's houſe, who kept a good Table, his drink was <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> but ſo ſmall, as it was little better then water. But to that I was anſwered, it was the ſecond decotion. I then enquired for the firſt, which he ſhewed me in a four ounce glaſs in the window, and told me, the Patient drank three of thoſe in a day <hi>tribus horis medic.</hi> I was ſurprized at this new way, and did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my ſmall ſucceſs. I thought it not reaſonable to take notice of it to the Patient, but ſpake to the Apothecary to forbear the giving the ſecond decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to make the firſt proportionably, as it was by the Phyſician preſcribed, and to repeat the Purgative oftner. In this latter I prevailed, but the former he juſtified, and continued that method to the laſt. By the frequent purging, and the application of a Cerate made with the ſolution of crude Mercury <hi>in aq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> that <hi>Callus</hi> Chancre reſolved after we had ſpent near ſix weeks time. I then put the Patient upon ſweating, and adviſed a more ſtrict diet; but before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient had ſpent full out a fortnight he grew weary of the courſe, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf well brake off: but he relapſed ſoon after; whereas if he had been briskly purged, and afterwards kept to a ſtrict Diet, and a ſtrong decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and ſweat, he might have been perfectly cured in a month without any application to the Colloſity.</p>
                        <p>In ſtrong Contitutions he Malignity of this Diſeaſe is ſometimes diſcharged by a <hi>Bubo</hi> in the Groin, in which caſe it ought to be drawn outward by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes, and brought to Suppuration. Yet where it is not very forward (and is accompanied with Chancres, or other virulent Ulcers, as in one of the preceding obſervations,) I do not attend its ſuppuration, but proceed in the Cure with Antivenereals, as I have there ſhewed you: but where there is only a <hi>Bubo,</hi> I proceed as followeth:</p>
                        <p>One about 40 years of Age,<note place="margin">16. Obſervation of a <hi>Bubo.</hi>
                           </note> of a ſtrong ſanguine complexion, came to me with a ſwelled Glandule in his right Groin; it was of the bigneſs of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in its ſhell, ſomewhat painfull, but without heat. I ſuppoſing it Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, applyed a Cupping-glaſs to it, and afterwards an Emplaiſter of <hi>Pic. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gund. ſaponis nigri, axungiae porcinae, &amp; aceti an. part. aequal.</hi> granted the Patient liberty of Diet, by which, within 3 or 4 four days the tumour fixed and grew
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95669:271"/>bigger, and heated the skin, and by the continuance of that application, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with inflammation and much pain. I then applyed this ſuppurative Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm. ℞ <hi>rad. lilior. albor. cepar. ſub ciner. coctar. an</hi> ℥iv. <hi>far. tritic.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>axung. porci, anſeris an.</hi> ℥iſs. <hi>croci pulver.</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. The Tumour encreaſing and not growing ſoft, I added to the ſame Cataplaſm <hi>ferment. vet.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>pulpae fiicum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. in ſp. vini,</hi> by which it afterwards ſuppurated. I opened it in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part by inciſion, and diſcharged a ſlimy crude matter. I dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> upon a Tent, and afterwards added <hi>merc. praecipitat.</hi> Whilſt I deterged the Ulcer I let him blood, and purged him with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae</hi> 3 or 4. days; but after the firſt days purging, I gave him ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> over-night, and the infuſion the following morning. During thè time it was cicatrizing, I purged him with <hi>pil. coch. min. &amp; calomel.</hi> every third day. The other days he drank a <hi>decoct. ſarſae;</hi> and after the Ulcer was cicatrized, I gave him a few ſweats, and concluded the Cure.</p>
                        <p>A young Man came to me having a <hi>Bubo</hi> in his right Groin. I applyed an Emplaſter of <hi>Galbanum</hi> ſpread upon leather, and continued it there ſome days,<note place="margin">17. Obſervation of a <hi>Bubo.</hi>
                           </note> giving him the liberty of Diet. In a ſhort time it ſuppurated. I opened it by Cauſtick, and diſcharged a ſlimy matter. I dreſſed it up with Lenients to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſeparation of the <hi>Eſchar,</hi> and applyed an Emplaſter <hi>de mucliag.</hi> which <hi>empl. melilot.</hi> After the <hi>Eſchar</hi> digeſted off, I deterged with <hi>mund. Paracelſ.</hi> purged him with <hi>extract. Rudii &amp; calomel.</hi> every other day, and preſcribed a <hi>decoct. ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae, lig. guaiaci,</hi> &amp;c. which he drank thoſe intermitting days. After the ulcer was cicatrized I ſweat him, keeping him that while to a ſtricter diet, by which method he was ſecured from relapſing.</p>
                        <p>A Man about 34 years old, of a full body, came to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Wife in the houſe of his Phyſician,<note place="margin">18. Obſervation of a <hi>Bubo.</hi>
                           </note> he being indiſpoſed with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation on his belly to the left Groin, pretending he had over-heated his body by diſorder in drinking. He was adviſed to keep his bed, and diſpoſe himſelf to a breathing ſweat. After a day or two he complained more of his pain, upon which account I viſited him, and ſaw the inflammation diſcuſſed on his belly, but there remained a tumour in his Groin near ſuppurated. A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm was applyed to it <hi>ex rad. lilior. &amp;c.</hi> by which it ſuppurated a few days after, and I opened it by a Cauſtick, and gave vent to a crude ſanious matter. Whilſt I attended the digeſtion of this, the Patient took an opportunity to ſhew me ſome ſmall Chancres upon the <hi>Penis</hi> near the <hi>Fraenum.</hi> I dreſſed them, and gave him a ſolution of <hi>mel Aegyptiac. in decoct. plantag. &amp;c.</hi> to cure them.</p>
                        <p>The abſceſs not digeſting nor yielding to deterſives, I acquainted the Phyſician that I had diſcovered the Diſeaſe, Venereal, and implored his help. He purged the Patient with <hi>pil. Rudii, mer. dul.</hi> and preſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> by which the Ulcers <hi>in pene</hi> were cured, and the abſceſs grew well diſpoſed to heal. But upon the Phyſicians and my diſcourſing with the Patient of his Diſeaſe he grew paſſionate, and denied it to be Venereal; and a day or two after remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his lodgings two or three miles into the Country, and to avoid the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Diſeaſe, he diſmiſt me, and entertained another Chirurgeon, who complyed, and promiſed in few days to cure him without the help of internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: But after all his endeavours another Chirurgeon was Conſulted, by whoſe advice the Patient was put into a courſe of Antivenereals at laſt, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that, but grew otherwiſe Diſeaſed, and lived not many years.</p>
                        <p>A young Man was brought to my houſe, of a Plethorique body, Diſeaſed with a hard compacted ſwelling in his left Groin; it was a <hi>Bubo,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">19. Obſervation of a <hi>Bubo.</hi>
                           </note> and like to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate, I applyed an <hi>empl. diachyl. cum gummi.</hi> About a week or ten days after he came to me again, it was then ſuppurated; I opened it, and having diſcharged the matter, dreſſed it with <hi>unguent. Baſilic.</hi> upon a tent, and applyed over it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95669:272"/>ſome of the foreſaid Plaſter, and diſmiſſed him and his Apothecary with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to proceed. After two months I was fetched to this Patient, and ſaw that <hi>Bubo</hi> terminated in a Phagedenous Ulcer about three inches in length and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably broad with indented callous lips. The Ulcer it ſelf was ſordid, and has corroded round under thoſe lips; he had alſo on the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> four large round Ulcers and others like them in <hi>perinaeo.</hi> It was my wonder to ſee this Diſeaſe ſo rage, conſidering the courſe I had preſcribed was the ſame I had cured ſo many by: and he had taken ſo much <hi>merc. dul.</hi> that it was grown familiar to him and ſeemed to encreaſe the virulency in the Ulcers. I began the work with cutting of the jagged Lips, and filled the Ulcer with pledgets ſpread with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> dipt in precipitate, and dreſſed the other Ulcers after the ſame manner with <hi>empl. diachalcith.</hi> to retain them on. I did not let him blood becauſe I had permitted thoſe callous lips to bleed freely, but I directed a Clyſter to be adminiſtred that afternoon. I purged him the next day and two or three af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a <hi>decoct. amar.</hi> of Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſiers,</hi> and then gave him <hi>gr.</hi> xvj. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith mineral.</hi> in a Pill made up with <hi>conſ. roſ. rub.</hi> which vomited him well and purged him twice. That afternoon a Clyſter was given him of fat broath <hi>cum vitello ovi.</hi> After the firſt application of <hi>merc. praecipitat.</hi> I dreſſed the Ulcer <hi>in inguine</hi> with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> and <hi>merc. praecipitat.</hi> mixed. The other I dreſſed with pledgets preſſed out of <hi>lac ſublimat.</hi> By the repeating of the <hi>Turbith min.</hi> once in four or five days, I diſpoſed the Ulcers to heal, and by Clyſters and purging draughts between while I prevented ſalivating.</p>
                        <p>After the Ulcers in the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> and <hi>perinaeum</hi> were cicatrized, I put him into a ſtrict diet and kept him to the drinking of <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> with good ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks, and by purging him once in four days he was happily cured and continues ſo to this day.</p>
                        <p>Two young Lads,<note place="margin">20. Obſervation of <hi>Bubones,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres and pains in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> intimate companions, came out of the country alike clapt by one and the ſame wench; they having both failed of their Cure there, were commended to my care. They had both ſwellings in their left Groins and calloſities about the <hi>glans</hi> remaining from preceeding Chancres. They were alſo afflicted with <hi>verrucae</hi> and <hi>mariſcae in podice,</hi> and pains in their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Theſe ſwellings in their Groins were without pain or inflammation, ſo not like to come to ſuppuration. Therefore without more ado I let them both blood and purged them two or three days with Sir <hi>Alex. Fraſier</hi>'s <hi>Potus amarus,</hi> then gave them each a doſe of <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> which vomited them well, and took off their pains. The next day I ſnipt off the <hi>mariſcae</hi> and <hi>verrucae,</hi> rubbing their remaining roots with the cauſtick Stone; and having cleanſed them, I dreſſed them up with Lenients, and after ſeparation of the Eſchars cicatrized them with the Vitriol Stone and <hi>unguent. epulotic.</hi> During the Cure of theſe I repeated the <hi>Turbith min.</hi> once in four or five days, and between while carried down the matter by Clyſters and Lenient purgatives, by which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I reſolved the calloſities and the <hi>glands.</hi> Then I put them into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> with ſudorificks, and with <hi>extract. Rudii</hi> and <hi>calomel.</hi> every fourth day finiſhed their Cure.</p>
                        <p>A Phyſician and my ſelf were fetched to a man whom we found in bed.<note place="margin">21. Obſervation of heat, <hi>puſtulae, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> He was not ſick, but broken out all over his body with heat. The Phyſician adviſed him to diſpoſe himſelf to a breathing Sweat upon a draught of warm Poſſet-drink, wherein was boiled <hi>raſ. C.

Theſe were viſible ſymptoms of the <hi>Lues,</hi> and appeared ſo to me at the ſecond viſit I made him; but he did not acknowledge it till ſome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95669:272"/>few days after, and then he ſhewed me ſome corroſive Ulcers on the <hi>penis</hi> near the <hi>fraenum,</hi> and ſome <hi>verrucae in perinaeo,</hi> yet denied that it was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a late date. He was contented we ſhould proceed in the Cure, to which purpoſe he was let blood and the next day purged with an infuſed Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After which was purged him with <hi>calomel. &amp;c.</hi> proportionably as his ſtrength would bear, avoiding the making his chaps ſore. By this method the Ulcers dried and the Scabs ſhell'd off, the Ulcers on the <hi>penis</hi> were dreſſed and cured as hath been ſhewed in the preceding Chapters. We then preſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> with <hi>antimon. diaphoret. bazoard. min. &amp;c.</hi> and ſome few days he ſeat; but he ſuppoſing himſelf cured brake off from our method: whence it came to paſs that the malignity afterwards ſhewed it ſelf in different forms. Sometimes in an <hi>ophthalmia</hi> threatning his eye-ſight, in which caſe he conſulted oculiſts and others, but after all was cured by us with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned purgatives. After that he was afflicted with a fierce Catarrh, in the cure of which he ran long courſes of pectorals, but was only relieved by us with Antivenereals. But not proſecuting that method of cure, he was ſome months after grieved with a Colick which laſted a long time, and a <hi>hernia humoralis</hi> attended that: upon which conſiderations he at laſt ſubmitted to a more ſtrict method, and was freed of his Colicks and other ſymptoms by purging with Catharticks, mixt with <hi>calomel.</hi> The courſe was finiſhed with <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> drying diet and ſweating.</p>
                        <p>A Woman aged 27 years being quick with Child was broken out in her head and face and ſeveral parts of her body with <hi>ſerpigo</hi> and various <hi>puſtulae</hi> and ſcabs. I let her blood, and the next day purged her with an infuſion of <hi>ſena,</hi>

When theſe happen in the Thighs or other parts which are not ſo viſible, I do not concern my ſelf in the dreſſing them otherwiſe than to defend them from adhering to their Linen, till they be dried by internals: but in this place I was obliged to remove the callous lips and the ſeveral excreſcences in the Ulcer to render the cicatrix ſmooth. To which purpoſe I rub'd them with the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſtone, and waſted and dried the <hi>hyperſarcoſis</hi> by the application of red pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate; and afterwards by the uſe of the Vitriol ſtone and Epuloticks I cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized the Ulcer ſo even, as at this preſent there are no marks of it.

I did not believe his blood would be the better, yet if he thought ſo he might proceed in that courſe, and when he ſhould be let blood I deſired he would ſend for me.

About ſix weeks after when he had finiſhed his courſe of Phyſick, he ſent to me again. I let him blood about the ſame quantity as before. His blood was like that ſome of our Phyſicians call pleuritical, it had neither colour nor conſiſtence; yet I thought not the worſe of it (ſo he was cured) for upon a return to his wonted diet the blood would recover its ſormer colour: but he relapſed ſome weeks after, and I let him blood again, and it was as at firſt of good colour and conſiſtence. He was well pleaſed to ſee his blood look better, but was ſo much diſſatisfied with his late treatment that he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded again into a ſtrict courſe of Phyſick, yet I undertook the cure, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him frequently with <hi>pil. è duobus</hi> and <hi>calomel.</hi> and ſometimes gave him the

He had taken much Mercury and only ſlavered with it, but the while he was freed of all the ſymptoms ſave that of his tongue, and that ſeemed inclinable to heal. Therefore I purged off the Mercury with the bitter decoction for ſeveral days, till I had run him very low. Then I put him into a ſtrict courſe of diet with <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> ſweating and purging him the ſpace of ſixteen days, during which the Ulcer in his tongue cured.

I hearing them ſay it was occaſioned by a ſcratch, I did not much mind it; but ſo ſoon as I heard him ſpeak I took notice of his hoarſeneſs and took him to the window, where looking into his mouth I ſaw the tonſils ulcerated and the <hi>uvula</hi> black with the mortification, and part of it ſeparating. His noſe was alſo ſtuffed with cruſly Ulcers. I queſtioned him privately how long it was ſince he had a Gonorrhoea or Chancre, and who cured them. He confidently denied he ever had any, however the <hi>Lues</hi> was viſible and required a ſpeedy remedy. He was preſently let blood, and I gave him two papers of <hi>mer. dul.</hi> ℈j. in a paper, with directions to take the one at night in a ſpooonful of bread and milk, and the other in the morning, and two hours after to drink Poſſet-drink with an ounce and half of <hi>Manna</hi> diſſolved in it.

I was angry with the Nurſe, ſuſpecting there had been ſome neglect in the proſecution of his courſe of Phyſick; but the Nurſe replyed, he had made his noſe ſore by picking of it. For a farther tryal I adviſed the Patient to forbear ſo ding, and to keep his chamber a while longer; he did ſo, and 3 or 4 days after I viſited him again, and ſaw that noſtril well, and was ſatisfied that he had picked it.

To which purpoſe at the next dreſſing I rubbed them with a Cauſtick Stone, and clipt off the ſloughs, then ſprinkled them with precipitate, and after ſeparation of thoſe ſloughs, I rubbed the lips with a Vitriol Stone, and by the one and other I ſmoothed the Ulcer, and at laſt cicatrized it with pledgets dipt in <hi>Lac Virgin.</hi> but the <hi>cicatrix</hi> appearing unequal, I rubb'd the remaining eminences again with a little Cauſtick, and left it at laſt cicatrized more ſmooth to the Patients ſatisfaction. I was glad I had preſerved my Credit with him. But it being Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal, I ſuſpected that it would ſhew it ſelf again in the ſame place, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a Node upon his skin, as you may read in ſome of the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                        <p>A Man of about thirty two years of Age, of a ſtrong Conſtitution,<note place="margin">36. Obſervation of <hi>Herpes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading all the Body.</note> came to me upon a ſuppoſition of having the Kings Evil. His Face was o're-ſpread with <hi>Herpes exedens,</hi> ſome of them cruſted high with dry ſcabs upon his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and lips; his head was covered over as it were with one ſcab, and in truth his whole body ſo diſeaſed with eating Ulcers, that he could neither fit nor lye without very great pain; his ſhirt, drawers and ſtockings being ſtiff with the matter that flowed from them. Upon enquiry into the Original of his Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I diſcovered that he had contracted a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> beyond Sea, and had been diſeaſed with <hi>puſtulae,</hi> &amp;c. above half a year. I preſcribed him a Clyſter that evening, let him blood the next morning in the Arm about ten ounces, gave him ℈j. <hi>Calomel.</hi> that night going to bed, and purged it off in the morning with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, rhab.</hi> &amp;c. The next morning he took <hi>Turbith min.</hi> gr. xij. and drank a draught of Poſſet-drink after it, which vomited him three or four times, and purged him much. This poor Mans condition being extream uneaſie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me to proſecute the drying up thoſe Ulcers with what expedition I could: Wherefore I gave him <hi>Calomel.</hi> and <hi>Turbith</hi> the oftner, and purged it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the bitter drink either the ſame day or the next, accordingly as his ſtrength would bear, till I ſaw the ſeveral Ulcers dryed, and the ſcabs ſhell'd off: Then I left off the uſe of the purging drink, and encreaſed the Doſe of <hi>Turbith min.</hi> till I ſaw him ſalivate; which ſalivation laſted about 18 or 20 days. In the declination thereof, I purged him again with the foremention'd decoction, and finiſhed the courſe of Phyſick with <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> ſudorificks, ſweating and drying diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to my uſual method. During which I rubb'd off the ſeveral remaining excreſcences (riſing from the Ulcers) with cauſtick ſtones, and cicatrized them with the vitriol ſtone, <hi>unguent. deſiccativ. rubr.</hi> &amp;c. and diſmiſſed him Cured.</p>
                        <p>One came to me having an <hi>Herpes exedens</hi> on his Chin,<note place="margin">37. Obſervation of <hi>Herpes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigin.</hi> &amp;c.</note> and many eruptions about his Body, with wandering pains on his Shoulders, Arms and Legs. He deſired to be cured, but would not be confined to his Chamber. I declining to meddle with him upon thoſe terms, he put himſelf into the hands of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick whom he had formerly known in <hi>Italy.</hi> He undertook the Cure with great promiſes. But after the taking that Empiricks preſcriptions a much longer time than he had undertaken to Cure him in, the Symptomes remaining, the Patient grew peeviſh; and the Empirick to recover his Credit with him altered his method, by which it ſeemed the Ulcers Cured. But in the while his Chaps ſwelled, and in taking cold a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> with a <hi>teneſmus</hi> followed, and with much diſorder he was brought to a Lodging near me.</p>
                        <p>I cauſed him to be put into a warm Bed, and preſcribed him a <hi>Bolus</hi> ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick, and with a draught of warm Poſſet put him into a ſweat, and ſome hours after adviſed a Milk Clyſter <hi>cum vitellis ovor.</hi> &amp;c. to lenifie his bowels, and laid him to reſt with <hi>elect. diaſcord.</hi> and the next morning I purged him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95669:276"/>of <hi>ſena, rhabarb. &amp;c.</hi> and repeated the opiate, by which the griping of his guts were remitted. But in this while the ſwelling in his chaps was ſunk, and he complained of a noiſe and pain in his ears, and though his mouth was very ſore yet did he not ſpit. I much ſuſpecting how I ſhould cure him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſalivating, gave him 4 grains of <hi>arcanum Corallinum,</hi> by which he vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often, and thereby I raiſed the ſwelling in his chaps and he fluxed near three weeks. All which time I kept him to warm poſſet-drink and Cordials, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred Clyſters as occaſion offered them. As the Flux declined I purged him with the bitter decoction, and by a drying diet, ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cured him.</p>
                        <p>One aged about 26 years having breakings out in his head, right brow, and ſeveral parts of his body with pains on his ſhoulders and legs,<note place="margin">38. Obſervation of <hi>puſtulae,</hi> Ulcers and nocturnal pains.</note> I let him blood, and the next day purged him with a cathartick potion. Then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration he had failed of his cure in other hands through his irregularity, I cauſed the unction to be applied for ſome days, but he not ſalivating well thereby, I gave him ℈ſs. <hi>Turbith miueral.</hi> and raiſed it higher, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it between three weeks and a month, during which his pains ceaſed and his skin became clean. In the declining of the Flux I purged him with the bitter drink, and put him into diet-drink, ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to finiſh his courſe by bathing; but he ſuppoſing this latter courſe needleſs, broke off unknown to me. About two months after he was brought to me more diſeaſed, and upon enquiry into the cauſe I found he had taken too great a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eating and drinking during his Cure. To avoid which inconvenience now I lodged him in a houſe where there was a more ſtrict guard of him; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated venaeſection and purged him again with the bitter apozeme 7 or 8 days, and gave him <hi>calomel.</hi> every other night during his purging: then preſcribed him a doſe of 15 grains of <hi>Turbith min.</hi> and repeated the <hi>Turbith min.</hi> ſo often as I might conveniently do without fluxing him. After I had thus freed him of all thoſe ſymptoms, I put him into a more ſtrict diet, and by diet-drink and ſweating him with <hi>gum. guaiaci, &amp;c.</hi> alſo purging him once in three or four days, I ſecured him from relapſe and concluded the courſe by bathing him.</p>
                        <p>A Man aged about 50 years,<note place="margin">39. Obſervation of an <hi>ophthalmia.</hi>
                           </note> of a ſeeming healthful conſtitution, having been long ſubject to inflammations in his eyes had tryed ineffectually the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral endeavours of Oculiſts and others by various <hi>collyria,</hi> purging, bleeding, bliſtering, ſhaving the head, fontinels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At length he conſulted me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to me the manner of his life and the various remedies he had taken. I ſuſpected the diſtemper in his eyes aroſe from ſome relict of the <hi>Lues Venerea;</hi> upon which ſurmiſe I readily undertook his Cure. I began it with the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes with a ſolution of <hi>troch. albi Rhaſ. in aq. roſ. rub.</hi> and applied <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtr. ad Herniam</hi> on his Temples. The next day I let him blood and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him a Clyſter. The morning after purged him with <hi>pil. Rudii &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul.</hi> and diſpoſed him to reſt that following night with an anodyne draught. The morning after I gave him <hi>bezoard. mineral. gr.</hi> xv. <hi>gum guaiaci gr.</hi> viij. <hi>in cochlearia cum ſyr. limon.</hi> and a draught of <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lig. lentis, cum flor. anthos, euphrag. &amp;c.</hi> as is ſet down in the method of cure, to diſpoſe him to a breathing ſweat, and adviſed the drinking the foreſaid decoction daily excepting when he purged, which was every fourth day. By this method his eyes were cured in the ſpace of ten days, but he proſecuted the method longer.</p>
                        <p>A young fellow grievouſly afflicted with an inflammation of both his eyes, with <hi>puſtulae</hi> and Ulcers in the <hi>tunica cornea</hi> &amp; <hi>adnata,</hi>

I let him blood
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95669:276"/>at that inſtant, and purged him the next day with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, &amp;c.</hi> He was of a ſtrong conſtitution and ſeemed to require ſuch evacuation. The evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his purging I nade him a <hi>ſeton,</hi> and brought a fomentation to give a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the impacted humours, with which I fomented his eyes. I alſo dropt a collyrie into them of <hi>aq. chelidon. mirabilis, &amp;c.</hi> as it is preſcribed in the Treatiſe <hi>de ſtrumis.</hi> While I was one day dreſſing his <hi>ſeton</hi> and eyes, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned him whether he ever had a <hi>Gonorrhoea;</hi> he denied it faintly. I urged him farther, and looked upon his <hi>penis</hi> and ſaw a hard <hi>callus,</hi> the remains of a Chancre. Upon ſight of this I purged him with <hi>pul. cornichini</hi> and <hi>mer. dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and repeated it often, and thereby took off the fluxion and diſpoſed his Ulcers to cure; and afterwards by <hi>Turbith min.</hi> vomited him once a week. Between while I preſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> with <hi>bezoard. mineral. gum. guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aci, &amp;c.</hi> and regulated his diet accordingly. By this method I cured his eyes, and he gradually recovered his ſight to walk about the ſtreets, and of late years can write and read.</p>
                        <p>A poor fellow came to me diſeaſed with a <hi>fiſtula lachrymalis,</hi> which at firſt ſight ſeemed by its callous lips to be cancerated,<note place="margin">41. <hi>Obſervation of</hi> Fiſtula lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis.</note> but being informed that he had heretofore been clapt, I readily undertook his cure, and began with letting him blood, and purged him with <hi>pil. cochiae min. &amp; calomel.</hi> During his purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I deterged the Ulcer and diſpoſed it to cure by removing the chancrous lips, and made way to the bone, which being carious I dried with an actual cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and from that time dreſſed it as hath been ſhewed in thoſe obſervations of <hi>fiſtula lachrymalis</hi> in the ſaid Chapter <hi>de ſtrumis,</hi> and compleated the Cure by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivenereals as in the preceeding obſervation hath been preſcribed, and diſmiſſed him perfectly well.</p>
                        <p>One about 28 years of age had heretofore been afflicted with an abſceſs on the outſide of his right leg,<note place="margin">42. Obſervation of a <hi>Phagedaenae</hi> on the Leg.</note> which not yielding to the common endeavours of Chirurgery by laying open, digeſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I was fetched; and ſeeing the Ulcer of a great length, the lips of it jagged and callous, I cut them off and dreſt the Ulcer with the common digeſtive, and ſprinkled the Ulcer it ſelf (which was ſordid) with <hi>merc. praecipit.</hi> and pledgets of dry Lint, an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over it, with a compreſs wrung out of red Wine, and rouled it up. Having thus dreſſed up the Ulcer, I enquired into the original of the diſtemper, ſuſpecting it to have riſen from ſome malign Fevour, or the reliques of ſome ill cured Clap. But the Patient denying that he ever had either of them, I endeavoured to inform my ſelf of the method preſcribed by thoſe under whoſe hands he had been, and diſcovered that he had taken <hi>mer. dulcis, antimon. diaphoret.</hi> and decoctions of <hi>ſarſa, &amp;c.</hi> which method I again repeated, and proceeded in digeſting of the Ulcer ſome days, and put on a laced ſtocking, but I could not make good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion in three days. I conſidering the evil quality of the Ulcer and the manner of life the Patient had formerly led, concluded the diſeaſe certainly venereal, and that the <hi>merc. dul. &amp;c.</hi> preſcribed him was not of ſufficient force to quell ſuch a malignity. For daily practice ſheweth that <hi>mer. dulcis</hi> given once in two or three days will not check the leſſer ſpecies of the <hi>Lues;</hi> and where it is not powerful to cure, it maketh the eroſion greater, and the diſeaſe becometh more inveterate. Upon which conſiderations without farther enquiry into the diſeaſe I attempted the cure by antivenereals, and gave him <hi>gr.</hi> 12. <hi>Turbith min.</hi> in a <hi>bolus</hi> with <hi>conſ. boraginis;</hi> it vomited him 4 or 5 times, and purged him twice, and put him upon a <hi>teneſmus,</hi> which I took off that afternoon by a clyſter of Milk with the yolk of an Egg, and endeavoured to excuſe the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh working of the medicament. The next day I ſaw the good effects of the Phyſick in digeſting of the Ulcer, and reſolved to proſecute the method or quit the Patient. I dreſſed up the Ulcer with <hi>unguent. baſilic. cum praecipitat.</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95669:277"/>and bandage, deſigning to effect this Cure by Internals; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I repeated a Clyſter that day and the next, and the fourth day gave him 16 gr. of <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> in a Pill, which wrought as the former, and directed a Clyſter again in the afternoon. That night he ſpit much, and in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning complained of a ſoreneſs of his Chaps; but I not obſerving him likely to flux purged him the day after with <hi>Manna</hi> in a draught of Poſſet-drink, ſuppoſing I ſhould make a greater revulſion by vomiting him twice or thrice, than by the raiſing a ſlight Salivation; but he growing impatient with the ſoreneſs of his mouth, I changed that reſolution, and gave him 18 grains of <hi>Turbith,</hi> and thereby fluxed him 19 or 20 days. In the declination of it, I preſcribed him a decoction of <hi>Sarſa,</hi> and purged him with an Apozeme made in ſome of the ſame decoction. During the Salivation the Ulcer cicatrized by the application of the above mentioned Epuloticks, and I finiſhed the Cure by drying Diet and Sudorificks. After which he removed into the Country, and by a Milk-diet recovered his ſtrength, and his Leg became uſeful to him; but he continued the wearing his laced ſtocking ſometime longer.

Obſervation of a</hi> Herpes mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aris in planta pedis.</note> having been long troubled with a <hi>Herpes miliaris</hi> which had ſpread it ſelf on the ſoal of one of his feet, came to me for Cure. He had taken <hi>Mer. dulcis, Antimon. Diaphoret.</hi> &amp;c. Medicines proper enough to Cure the milder Species of the <hi>Lues Venerea;</hi> but the Patient being irregular, and not acknowledging it Venereal, failed of his Cure. At the firſt ſight of the Ulcers I concluded them Venereal, and reſolved to proceed with him by ſuch a method, or leave him to ſeek his Cure elſewhere; and began by purging him with <hi>Pil. Rudii, &amp; mer. dul.</hi> and afterwards preſcribed him a few Pills of <hi>Aethiops mineralis cum terebinth.</hi> One of which he took every morning, drinking a draught of a medicated Ale after it. After he had taken ſix of theſe Pills, I began with the Cure of the Ulcers, dreſſing them with the <hi>fotus</hi> and liniment ſet down in the Cure of <hi>Herpes;</hi> but that not anſwering my expectation, I waſh'd the Ulcers and parts about them with warm Milk; then having cleanſed and dryed them, I rubbed the lips of them all with a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Stone, till I had eradicated and ſmoothed them fit for to cicatrize, and then waſht out the lixivial ſalt to prevent its farther penetration. From that time I dreſſed them up with <hi>Merc. praecipitat.</hi> and put on a laced ſock. The third or fourth dreſſing the ſloughs crumbled off, and the Ulcers appeared well cicatrized. But within few days they all brake out again. At the ſight of which I concluded the Ulcers Venereal, and prevailed with him to take Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, and began with a ℈j. <hi>Calomel,</hi> and the next day gave him a Doſe of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riac. metallor.</hi> and repeated it two or three days, I deſigning that way to Cure theſe Ulcers. But the <hi>Theriaca</hi> not moving him by ſtool or vomit, he wrangled with me, ſuppoſing I could not cure him but by ſuch Medicaments as worked one of thoſe ways, whereas we know by experience, that Mercury frequently cureth thoſe Ulcers by altering the quality of the Humours; but I complyed with his deſire, and gave him a Doſe of <hi>Turbith</hi> gr. xij. in a Pill that vomited him five or ſix times, and purged him twice or thrice. The next morning he complained of the ſoreneſs of his mouth. I adviſed him to drink warm Poſſet-drink, and to take a Clyſter, but he did neither. I being ingaged in the Cure, thought it beſt to haſten a Salivation before he ſhould be aware of it, and gave him two Doſes more of the <hi>Turbith,</hi> encreaſing each Doſe two grains. Theſe made his Chaps ſorer, and would have fluxed him, but he being ungovernable it cauſed a <hi>Teneſmus,</hi> and ran down in a Diarrhoea with a large evacuation, and terminated in a dyſentery. Upon the ſight hereof, I would have preſcribed him ſuch Remedie as is uſual in thoſe caſes, but he was ſo impatient at the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95669:277"/>as to admit of no excuſe from me, nor any of my Preſcriptions. Indeed the <hi>Herpes</hi> was dryed, and he had an eminent Phyſician his friend who relieved him by his Preſcriptions, and reſtored him to health ſoon after, and could as eaſily have then prevented the relapſe; but the Patient being well, concluded he ſhould continue ſo, and brake off abruptly from him without any obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diet-drink, Sweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and became ſo good natured as to make me a Viſit in acknowledgement of his Cure. But about a month after he ſent for me, complaining of an itching he felt in the ſoal of his foot, he ſuppoſed from his too much walking the day before; I looked upon it and ſaw a heat riſing in the skin. I believed it a return of the Diſeaſe, but having reſolved not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to engage my ſelf in the Cure, I left him with a favourable conſtruction of it. The next news I heard of him, was, that one pretending to Chirurgery had undertaken the Cure of it by bathing it with a Decoction of Broom, and boaſted ſo confidently of the Cure, as if he had already performed it, calling them a few Kibes. But whilſt he was picking of theſe out, the Patient ſhewed me a ſwelling upon the ſhin bone, and deſired my judgement of it. It was a very well grown Node, and I gueſſed by the Patients thin Chaps that it was no ſmall diſturbance to his reſt, however it was a confirmation of the quality of his Diſeaſe, and might ſerve to alarm him to provide for his Cure. I was then taking a Journey into the Weſt-country, and at my return was informed that the died under ſome Empiricks hand in his courſe of Phyſick.</p>

He had alſo three diſtinct Ulcers on the <hi>os Tibiae</hi> of the right Leg a little above the ancle, which were alſo carious. That on the Arm took its original from a Node, as the other on the Leg did from a <hi>Gumma.</hi> They had been ſome years ulcerated, and I ſuppoſe the malignity diſcharged it ſelf there, for other Symptomes of the <hi>Lues</hi> he had none at that time. I began with the Cure of theſe Ulcers by the application of Cauſticks to remove the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Callus,</hi> and make way to the bones. That in the Arm lay deep, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired deterſion and dilatation, which was the work of ſome weeks; but the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95669:278"/>others on the <hi>os Tibiae</hi> lay ſuperficial; and as the Eſchars ſeparated in ſome of them, bits of bones came away with them. Where any remained intangled in looſe fleſh, I ſprinkled that fleſh with precipitate daily, and with that and the Vitriol Stone made way for the taking out the remaining bones, and with much eaſe cicatrized thoſe Ulcers, the exfoliation of theſe from the main bone having indeed been made to my hand by the ſtrength of Nature, and required no more from me than the making them way to come forth. But that <hi>caries</hi> in the bone of the Arm lay ſlab'd in matter, and was not ſo eaſily come to; and when it was, it did not yield to the ordinary applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The next day I found the tumour ſunk, but the cauſtick had penetrated to the bone accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length and breadth that was deſigned. I cut the <hi>Eſchar</hi> round, and raiſed it with the <hi>Perioſteum,</hi> and ſaw the bone ſound, and naturally white and ſmooth. I dreſſed it with pledgets dipt in <hi>liniment. Arcei</hi> warm, and the remaining <hi>Eſchar</hi> with <hi>unguent. baſilic.</hi> to haſten its ſeparation. After ſome few days the <hi>Eſchar</hi> ſeparated, but the Ulcer grew painful and enflamed, and would not digeſt: upon which conſideration I enquired into the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſcriptions, and finding them not of ſufficient force I prevailed to give a few grains of <hi>Turbith minerale,</hi> and thereby made a revulſion. From that time I digeſted the Ulcer with that common digeſtive <hi>ex Terebinth. &amp;c.</hi> and cured it as an Ulcer with <hi>caries;</hi> during which the malignity was eradicated by Antivenereals.</p>
                        <p>I am not againſt the applying of medicaments to further the reſolving of nodes, but the laying them open till they have made their way by apoſtemation ſeemeth to me unreaſonable, it being not only painful but alſo a prolonger of the cure. For ſuppoſing you do remove the node and cure the Ulcer, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you do eradicate the malignity, other nodes will ariſe. Whereas if Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venereals be rightly adminiſtred, you may reſolve the nodes by them at the ſame time. I once ſaw a very large node upon the <hi>os frontis</hi> reſolved meerly by a courſe of diet-drink, purging and ſweating. Sir <hi>Fa. Pruyean</hi> was the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and Mr. <hi>Pearce</hi> the Apothecary attended the Patient for his Maſter <hi>Laxton</hi> as I ſuppoſe. The courſe was long and more ſtrict than our Patients will now endure; but by Mercurials we do more certainly reſolve them, and in a leſs time.</p>

                           </note> of a ſtrong conſtitution, afflicted with nodes in his Arms and Legs, an <hi>ozaena</hi> and an Ulcer in his palate, in both which the bones were carious, had been eight weeks in Phyſick under the hands of an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95669:278"/>Empirick, and being at a loſs conſulted me. They ſhewed me ſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had deviſed to hook out the bones; they alſo ſhewed me ſome little bits of bones which they had broken off from the whole. I admired the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Empirick to glory in ſuch work, but am ſince ſatisfied that a confidence in prating is a ſufficient baſis to build a practiſe upon amongſt ſome kind of people. As to his Inſtruments they were well enough contrived to pull out bones, but it would have been more for his credit to have deſigned ſome way to have kept them in. For in ſome of thoſe places the leaſt diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a bone cauſeth a deformity; and in others, as thoſe of the Palate, there will want a ſupply of <hi>callus,</hi> and ſo conſequently it would not only ſpoil his drinking but his voice. Upon which conſideration thoſe Inſtruments were laid aſide, and <hi>errhina</hi> were preſcribed, as in the method of Cure hath been ſhewed, of which he ſnuft up or injected ſome into his noſtrils often in a day. In order to his cure I reſolved to ſalivate him by unction; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I let him blood and purged him with a lenitive <hi>bolus,</hi> and afterward bathed him 3 or 4 times; then cauſed him to be anointed, and thereby raiſed the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; all which time I had regard to the waſhing his chaps and keeping up his ſtrength. About the 24. day the Salivation declining I purged him with the bitter decoction, and then put him into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> and ſweat him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning his diet drying according as his mouth healed. During the time of his ſalivating the Ulcers in his Noſe cured, and ſo did that in his Palate, but the bones they had pulled away left the marks; yet that in the Palate was ſupplyed by a ſmall Plate which was retained by a Spunge. Some of his Nodes diſcuſſed during his Salivation, and the other in the time of ſweating. He being thus cured we ended our courſe of Phyſick with bathing.</p>
                        <p>One of about 28 years old being grievouſly afflicted with a Catarrh,<note place="margin">48. Obſervation of the <hi>

I bieng ſent for to make it, found the Patient in bed ſo emaciated as it was impoſſible he ſhould continue it there without great pain. I deſiring ſome way to be uſeful to him enquired into the quality of his Diſeaſe, and looking into his throat ſaw the tonſils extremely ulcerated, the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> and that part of the Palate eaten away. I concluded it Venereal, and before I ſtirred from him diſcovered it was the effects of a Chancre ill cured.</p>
                        <p>I took leave of him, and acquainted thoſe that ſent me of the nature of his Catarrh. They having ſatisfied themſelves of the truth put him into my hands. There was no great matter of credit to be gotten in endeavouring a cure, where the Patient ſhould be left to ſnuffle all the days of his life; but I obeyed them, and preſcribed him that night ℈j. <hi>mer. praecipitat. albus</hi> in a ſpoonful of white bread and milk. I directed the waſhing his throat with one of the Gargles ſet down in the method of Cure, and dreſſed them daily with <hi>lac ſublimat.</hi> preſcribing him a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> to be drank with a third part of milk, at the leaſt thrice a day. I repeated the <hi>praecipitatus albus</hi> morning or evening alſo a Clyſter ſometime to keep his body ſoluble. By this method I cured theſe Ulcers in the ſpace of three weeks. Soon after as he recovered his ſtrength, I left off the uſe of the milk and proſecuted the courſe by a ſtrict diet, <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> diaphoreticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then fitted his Palate with a Plate of ſilver which he could put up and take out at pleaſure. It formed his voice and ſerved to lead the drink its right way.

                        </p>
                        <p>A Woman of about 28 years of age having been ſome while vexed with the leſſer ſpecies of this Diſeaſe, put herſelf under ſome hands for cure; but during that method ſhe complained of a ſoreneſs in her throat, which increaſing, ſhe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95669:279"/>conſulted others, and afterwards others, but unſucceſsfully. (I ſuppoſe from her own irregularity.) Some months being paſſed, her friends recommended her to me. Both her Tonſils were much ulcerated; there was alſo an Ulcer upon the back part of her Palate and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula.</hi> She had alſo a Node upon her right leg, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pains; alſo a <hi>fluor albus.</hi> I preſcribed her a Lotion as in the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and dreſſed the Ulcers with <hi>lac ſublimat.</hi> I let her blood and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her a Clyſter that night, and the next morning ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> I repeated this latter daily, ſhe drinking a draught of <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> after it, diſpoſing her ſelf to a breathing ſweat, and once in four days was purged with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, &amp;c.</hi> Thus I dryed thoſe Ulcers, but by the frequent repeating the <hi>calomel.</hi> her chaps grew ſore, and ſhe ſalivated, which I was not troubled at, her Node requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. Upon which conſideration I gave her 12 grains of <hi>Turbith minerale</hi> and raiſed it higher; and ſome days after when I ſaw the Salivation decline and the Node unreſolved, I applyed a Mercurial Emplaſter the whole length of that leg, and thereby continued the Salivation longer till that reſolved the Node. That done, I purged her with the bitter decoction, and put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtrict courſe of diet-drink, and ſweat her. After her mouth was cured, looking into her throat I ſaw the right tonſil cicatrized, but there remained unequal lips, which were troubleſom to her. I alſo felt with my Probe a <hi>ſinus</hi> running downward; it was made by a coalition of the flapping lips. I ſuſpecting theſe might cauſe ſome fluxion, or at leaſt ſuch an uneaſineſs as might beget in her a ſuſpicion of relapſe, I laid open that <hi>ſinus</hi> and cut off thoſe lips with the other <hi>cicatrices,</hi> and by rubbing the baſis of the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer with a Vitriol Stone cicatrized it afterwards ſmooth, and diſmiſſed her cured.</p>
                        <p>A Woman of about 28 years of age much emaciated was brought to me broken out all over her head,<note place="margin">50. Obſervation of a relapſe with Nodes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> face, and ſeveral parts of her body and limbs. It began with a virulent <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> the cauſe whereof not being diſcovered, it continued long upon her, and after ſome months was accompanied with a pain in her head; for remedy whereof ſhe conſulted her Phyſician, but ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf ignorant of the cauſe could not inform him, and conſequently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very long under it: but after theſe eruptions the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſtopped, and the pain in her head ceaſed. What theſe breakings out were ſhe had been lately informed, and deſired my help. I let her blood and purged her with <hi>decoct. ſenae Gereonis,</hi> and by a few doſes of <hi>praecipitat. alb.</hi> and a purging diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink I dried up theſe <hi>puſtulae</hi> and Ulcers, and deſigned then a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> with ſudorificks; but ſhe believing her ſelf cured retired to her own houſe. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a year after ſhe came to me again, afflicted with pains in her head, and Nodes on her ſhins, and Ulcers in her tonſils. I let her blood and adviſed a Clyſter, and dreſſed the Ulcers in the tonſils as hath been ſaid in the like caſe, and preſcribed her <hi>calomel.</hi> ℈j. in ℈ij. <hi>diaſcord.</hi> and purged her the next morning with a ſolution of <hi>Manna</hi> in Poſſet-drink. After I had by <hi>calomel.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what digeſted thoſe Ulcers I raiſed a Salivation by Unction, which ſhe bore very well, and was thereby freed of her Nodes. In the declination of the Flux I purged her with the bitter decoction five or ſix days, then put her into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> and afterwards by drying diet and ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the pain in her head went off, and the Ulcers of the tonſils were (long before I diſmiſſed her) well and perfectly cured.</p>
                        <p>A Woman aged about 30 years came out of the country upon a ſuppoſition of the Kings Evil.<note place="margin">51. Obſervation of Ulcers in the <hi>fauces</hi> with a <hi>Gumma</hi> on the <hi>Muſc. Maſtoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                           </note> She had a hard ſwelling encompaſſing the muſcle <hi>maſtoides</hi> on the right ſide of her neck of a great thickneſs. She complained alſo of a ſoreneſs in her throat, and of a ſtinking tough flegm which ſhe frequently hauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, eſpecially in the mornings. I looked into her throat and ſaw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95669:279"/>upon the further part of the Palate and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula,</hi> but no Ulcer in the tonſils. The inflammation of the Palate gave me cauſe to ſuſpect ſome latent Ulcer, and that her Diſeaſe was Venereal; but ſhe denying it, I preſcribed her a <hi>decoct. hord.</hi> with <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſic. &amp; diamoron,</hi> alſo an <hi>empl. de mucilag.</hi> with <hi>de ranis cum mercurio</hi> to apply to the <hi>Gumma.</hi> Dr. <hi>Lenthall</hi> who brought her to me, preſcribed her an opening apozeme and to be let blood in the Country. Thus we diſmiſſed her, but within few days after ſhe returned to us again, the Ulcer having ſeiſed upon the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> and ſpread it ſelf to the edges of the Palate. Upon ſight thereof we diſputed not of her diſeaſe, but conſidered of her cure. She had of late years been ſubject to great diſcharges of the <hi>menſtrua,</hi> and was thereby rendered of a lax and weak conſtitution, and her body having been ſo lately purged and bled, there required no other preparation than of a warm room, which was provided with all expedition. For thoſe Ulcers that ariſe on the interiour part of the Palate, ſoon corrode their way through, if the alarm be not taken from the inflammation that preceeds, a little miſchief there being for the moſt part irrecoverable. To prevent which we gave her that night ℈j. of <hi>calomel.</hi> and repeated it ſo often as we might conveniently do, and preſcribed her a <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> to drink with milk. We alſo preſcribed her ſome of the Lotions ſet down in the Method of Cure, ſome whereof we caſt up with a Syringe into her noſtrils, and with other ſhe gargled her throat often in a day. But the cure of the Ulcer was compleated by frequent taking of <hi>merc. dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> The <hi>Gumma</hi> alſo leſſened, but ſhe having recovered ſome meaſure of ſtrength, and her chaps being already ſore by the <hi>calomel.</hi> which ſhe had taken, we gave her 2 doſes of <hi>Turbith,</hi> beginning with 7 grains and ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by which we raiſed the Salivation, and thereby reſolved the <hi>Gumma.</hi> In the declining of the Flux we purged her with an Apozeme wherein was decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſena, polypod. rhab. agaric. turbith, jalap, &amp;c.</hi> with the addition of <hi>ſyr. de ſpina cervina.</hi> Then with drying diet-drink, ſudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we finiſhed the courſe and cured her.</p>
                        <p>A young man was commended to my care having an <hi>Ozaena</hi> in his noſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the <hi>ſeptum</hi> and <hi>alae;</hi> it ſeemed to be moſt on the right ſide,<note place="margin">52. Obſervation of an <hi>Ozaena.</hi>
                           </note> with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and great ſwelling. In undertaking the cure of theſe Ulcers you ought to be cautious in delivering your prognoſtick; for the bones and carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages are ſoft and covered with a thin membrane, which being once corroded corrupts quickly, and the leaſt defect in them leaveth a blemiſh in that part of the noſe. The external inflammation is a ſhrewd ſign that the Ulcer is deep, and conſequently that the bones and cartilages are carious: therefore let not the rectitude of the part deceive you, for that may be ſupported by the ſwelling and cruſty matter within, and upon the removal of them the noſe or ſides of it frequently ſink; and if any deformity therein happen while they are under your cure contrary to your prediction, they will certainly impute it to your neglect or ignorance. In this Patient I ſuſpected the right <hi>ala</hi> from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inflammation, but promiſed my utmoſt endeavours, and began my work with injecting a <hi>decoct. ex rad. althaeae, ſem. hord. cydonior.</hi> and embrocated the external parts with <hi>unguent. popul.</hi> alſo applied a Cerote of the ſame; then let him blood, and directed a Clyſter that evening.

Rudii,</hi> till I had removed the fluxion off his Noſe. After the cruſty matter ſeparated from within, I ſyringed and cleanſed thoſe ulcers with one of the decoctions ſet down in the method of cure. Having thus diſpoſed his Noſe to cure, I gave him a few doſes of <hi>turbith</hi> and raiſed a ſalivation, but the ulcers cicatrized before he ſalivated, yet I fluxed him 17 or 18 days. In the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it I purged, and ſweat him with <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

Upon which conſideration it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to lay it bare. I did lay it bare with the white Cauſtick, and divided the <hi>Eſchar</hi> to the bone, and at the next dreſſing raiſed the <hi>Eſchar</hi> off, then raſped the Node off, and dreſſed it dry, as hath been ſet down in Ulcers with <hi>Caries,</hi> The lips of the ulcer I digeſted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Within one half year he came to us again, not complaining of his Leg, but with Ulcers in both his Tonſils. Theſe were certainly Venereal, and I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they would be ſo acknowledged, and that I ſhould have an eaſie work of theſe. But the Patient would not be confined within doors, nor admit of other Phyſick than a decoction of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> and a few pouders of <hi>antimon. diaphoret.</hi> Three quarts of the foreſaid diet-drink were allowed him daily. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſeen him drink it up in a Morning as faſt as if it had been <hi>Tunbridge</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I once enquiring the reaſon why he drank them in ſuch haſte, he replyed, he was to dine with ſome good Fellows, and that he did it to make way for better liquor.</p>
                        <p>Thus he governed himſelf till the Ulceration increaſed, ſo that it was great pain to ſwallow any drink. He complained exceedingly to me that I could not at leaſt palliate thoſe Ulcers, whereas in truth I uſed my utmoſt endeavours by all the Medicaments I could deviſe; but they ſpread, and were accompanied with ſuch defluxion, as at laſt when he ſtrove to drink, part of it would guſh out of his noſtrils. Upon which conſideration the Phyſician was fetched, and a ſubmiſſion was promiſed to his Rules. The Cure was begun by a Clyſter, bleeding and purging, with an infuſed Potion, and the day after 25 gr. of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel.</hi> was given him in a ſpoonful of white bread and milk, and repeated daily or every other day, Clyſters or Purgatives being preſcribed between while to carry the matter downwards. By this method his Ulcers were diſpoſed to Cure, and he finding his throat eaſier had thoughts of dining abroad with his Friends. Upon notice whereof I got leave of the Phyſician to give him 14 gr. of <hi>Turbith mineral.</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> accordingly worked very well. I repeated it the next day to 16 gr. it likewiſe vomited him, and made him ſpit and his Chaps ſwelled: The next day he perceiving that he fluxed, deſired the Phyſician would preſcribe him Phyſick to purge it off, which was promiſed him; but a day or two after the flux not riſing ſufficiently, I brought him a <hi>Bolus</hi> of a mixture of <hi>turb. min.</hi> with <hi>conſ. borrag.</hi> which increaſed the Salivation. He ſent for me, and offered me fifty pound to take it off; but I aſſured him there was no danger of his Life, and encouraged him to ſubmit to it chearfully. He did ſo, and ſalivated 18 or 20 days as plentifully as I ever ſaw any. The ſalivation declining, he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with an infuſed Potion, and Diet-drink was brought him, he promiſing us that he would keep his Chamber, and obſerve a ſtrict method in Diet, Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he no ſooner found his Chaps cured, but he returned to his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty: and being told that he would moſt certainly relapſe if he did not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95669:280"/>proſecute the Courſe preſcribed by his Phyſician, he replyed laughing, It's thy Courſe and not the Phyſicians, that he was very well, and if I would dine with him I ſhould be a witneſs of it. I took leave of him, and ſaw him no more in half a year; and about that time he became more extreamly diſeaſed: for it is moſt certain, that Mercurial Remedies ſerve only to diſpoſe theſe humours to be evacuated by decoctions of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> &amp;c. with Sweating. How he was at laſt perfectly Cured you may ſee in ſome of the following Obſervations.</p>

                           </note> having been long diſeaſed with an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> was at length commended by Doctor <hi>Bate</hi> to the Cure of Doctor <hi>Jaſper Needham</hi> and my Self. The matter had corrupted part of the <hi>Septum,</hi> and other bones within her Noſe, and made its way externally between the ridge-bone and cartilages of the Noſtrils, and fouled the ſaid bone to the very brows. The griſtles being thus ſeparated from the foreſaid bone, and having loſt that part of the <hi>Septum,</hi> which ſhould have been their ſupporter, it ſunk downwards, leaving ſuch a breach, that the Injections which we caſt into her noſtrils with a ſyringe ſpurted out there. After we had thus diſcovered the evil quality of the Ulcer, we conſidered how to proceed in the Cure; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the difficulty of the Cure, and the length of time which might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the exfoliation of theſe bones, we reſolved without further diſpute to ſalivate her by Unction. To which purpoſe we let her blood, and purged her with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae,</hi> &amp;c. during which <hi>Errhina</hi> were prepared of a lenient quality, ſuch as have been propoſed in the method of Cure, to looſen the cruſty matter; and we enlarged the external Ulcer along the ridge-bone, as far as it was carious, in order to the exfoliation of it. We digeſted thoſe lips, and dreſt the bone dry according to the method ſet down in the Treatiſe of Ulcers with <hi>Caries.</hi> After we had by <hi>Errhina</hi> and Lotions cleanſed the internal Ulcers of their filth, we then proceeded by deterſive Injections, as preſcribed in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure, and put a <hi>Canula</hi> in each Noſtril made of a gooſe quill covered with a bit of <hi>empl. diachyl. ſimp.</hi> ſpread on a ſoft rag. Theſe ſerved to bear up the cartilages of the Noſtrils level with the end of the bone (which before ſtood as it were looking over them) that they might be in a capacity (if it was poſſible) to unite with it: While we were thus diſpoſing the Ulcers to Cure, we proceeded in the anointing her Legs and Arms, and thereby raiſed a Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which continued upon her more than three weeks. During that time the Ulcers cured within her Noſe, and the cartilages ſtood firm, and even to unite internally with the bone without the uſe of the <hi>Canula,</hi> but the bone there not being exfoliated, we continued the ſalivation longer by preſcribing <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius dulcis,</hi> &amp;c. and all that while we took care of her mouth, that no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ſhould happen to her Jaws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and kept up her Spirits with Broaths, Poſſet-ale and Cordials. After we ſaw the bones exfoliating we purged her with an Apozeme, and preſcribed <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> with Sudorificks to ſweat her.

                        <p>A Man of about 36 years of Age had a large Ulcer on the roof of his mouth with a <hi>Caries</hi> on the <hi>os palati,</hi> alſo many Nodes, <hi>viz.</hi>

I touched the Ulcer with <hi>aqua divina</hi> warm, and adviſed the dreſſing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95669:281"/>it twice a day after the ſame manner; to the inflamed <hi>Gumma</hi> I applyed an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> to prevent its apoſtemating. The reſt of the Nodes I deſigned to ſcatter by a ſalivation with unction. To which purpoſe I let him blood, and directed a Clyſter, and the next morning purged him with ℈j. <hi>Calomel.</hi> in a lenitive <hi>Bolus;</hi> and to diſpoſe him to reſt, I gave him ſome nights ℈j. <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi> in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. <hi>diaſcord.</hi> whereby the Ulcer in his palate was the better digeſted. Having thus prepared his Body for the Unction, I cauſed his limbs to be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daily till his Chaps ſwelled much; then I deſiſted, and adviſed Poſſet-drink, Broath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be alway ready for him to drink, and keep up his Spirits. There was alſo care taken to ſyringe and waſh his mouth. During his Salivation, the Ulcer in his palate caſt off a ſcale of a bone half an inch at leaſt in length, and preſently after cicatrized firmly; his pain ceaſed, and the <hi>Gumma</hi> reſolved, and all the Nodes diminiſhed much, ſave that on his ſhin; yet he did not ſpit a quarter ſo much in this Courſe as (he ſaid) he had done in the former raiſed by <hi>merc. dulcis.</hi> I continued him in the Salivation about twenty days, then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with the bitter decoction five or ſix days, and from that time kept him ſtrictly to his Diet-drinks, and with Sudorificks ſweat him, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his Diet more drying accordingly as his Chaps healed till I thought him cured, and then I gave him more liberty to nouriſh his body, and to drink the decoction of <hi>ſarſa</hi> with milk twice a day, and bathed him 4 or 5 days; and kept his body ſoluble with a lenient Electuary. Thus I diſmiſſed him, yet there remained ſomewhat of that Node on the ſhin, but it being without pain I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it would reſolve, as indeed it did within a fortnight after, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued well.</p>
                        <p>One of about thirty years of Age,<note place="margin">56. Obſervation of Nodes.</note> of a full Body, having been long afflicted with Nodes and exceſſive pains on divers parts, eſpecially onh is head, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into my hands for Cure. I deſigned a Salivation by Unction, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I prepared his Body by a Clyſter, veneſection and a purging Apozeme; then cauſed him to be placed near the fire, and to anoint himſelf from the ſoals of his feet to his groins, and ſo the arms and ſhoulders, and having put on his ſtockings, drawers and waſtecote he was laid in a warm bed, and with a draught of warm Poſſet-ale diſpoſed to a breathing ſweat. Thus I proceeded daily in the anointing him till I had waſted two pound of Unction, but he had formerly taken ſo much Mercury, that it ſeemed to be familiar to him, upon which account I proceeded in the anointing of him, but it ran downwards one night in a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhoea.</hi> I was fetched to him early in the morning, and was informed he had had near ſixty ſtools. During the time I was with him they were mucous and bloody, with much pain, he having a <hi>teneſmus</hi> with it, which put him upon a continual excretion. I cauſed a Clyſter of milk with yolks of eggs to be caſt up, and preſcribed <hi>decoct. C. C. calcinati</hi> to be made, and drank with milk, to ſome of which I added a few drops of liquid <hi>Laudanum.</hi> I alſo injected <hi>in ano</hi> three or four ſpoonfulls of <hi>ol. hyperici</hi> with a ſyringe, and adviſed it to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated to defend the interior coats of the inteſtine from excoriation. I preſcribed him a Pearl Julep and <hi>elect. diaſcord.</hi> as it is ſet down in the method of Cure, to be taken once in three or four hours; thus in four or five days the <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> ſtopped. Then I preſcribed him a <hi>Sarſa</hi>-drink, with an addition of milk till he had ſomewhat recovered his ſtrength, purging him in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val with <hi>elect. diacatholic. &amp;c.</hi> By this <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> he was freed of his pains, and of ſome of the Nodes. Thoſe which remained were much leſſened, and by a ſtrict Diet, <hi>decoct. ſarſae</hi> and ſudorificks were quite reſolved, and he enjoys a good health to this day.</p>
                        <p>It may here be objected by ſome, that if this Perſon had been more purged or well bathed before the anointing, the Salivation would have riſen eaſier, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95669:281"/>thereby the <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> might have been prevented. I do confeſs that the bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth much facilitate the raiſing of the Salivation, but we cannot have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that conveniency. Beſides, where we do bathe, theſe accidents have happened, and will befall any one of us in ſpite of all our endeavours. Yet I muſt tell you, when a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> thus happeneth in the raiſing a Salivation, it renders your Cure certain if you proſecute the method as I here did. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Mercury work upwards by vomit or ſalivation, or downwards by ſtool, it is not material, ſo the peccant humours be evacuated and diſpoſed to be carried off by Sudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if the Patient grow froward upon ſuch an accident, and will not ſubmit to a regulation in Diet, Purging, Sweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the humours do again ferment and render the Cure more difficult.</p>

                           </note> having been long afflicted with the <hi>Lues</hi> in its moſt inveterate Symptoms, Nodes, <hi>Gummata,</hi> and an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> had paſſed through many courſes of Phyſick, came to me extreamly extenuated. He had one Node upon the <hi>Os Lambdoides</hi> very great, and another upon his right eye-brow; others upon his arms and legs. I began with the letting him blood, and ſent him a Clyſter that evening. I ſyringed his Noſe with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct. hordei, rad. althaeae, ſem. cydon,</hi> &amp;c. and after I had cleanſed it of its cruſty matter (with which ſome bones came forth) I daily injected ſome of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſcribed in the method of Cure. I bathed him five or ſix times, and the while kept his body ſoluble by Clyſters, or by a lenitive Electuary, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him boiled Mutton, Veal or Chicken for his Dinner, and a couple of new laid Eggs for his Supper, a ſmall Ale for his drink. I alſo preſcribed him a grain of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> or ſome anodyne draught to appeaſe his nocturnal pains. After I had done bathing him, I cauſed his Legs Arms, Shoulders, Spine, and Hips to be anointed daily, and ſweat him in a warm bed with a draught of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-drink. After he began to ſpit I anointed him more ſparingly, onely his Legs and Arms, and when I ſaw his Chaps ſwelled ſufficiently, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare the anointing, and kept him to his Poſſet-drink and Broath, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mouth with <hi>decoct. hordei, rad. althaeae, liquiritiae,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very well near a month, but before he had ſpit fourteen dayes the pains diminiſhed, and the Nodes leſſened, and that filthy matter ceaſed to diſcharge out of his Noſe: Alſo a <hi>Gumma</hi> which ſeemed ready to burſt dryed up. In the declination of the flux I put him into a ſtrong <hi>decoct. ſarſae &amp;c.</hi> with Milk, and nouriſhed him with good medicated Broaths. As his ſtrength increaſed, I purged him with the bitter decoction ſome days, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Chaps healed I kept him ſtrictly to the <hi>Sarſa</hi>-drinks without the Milk, and ſweat him with <hi>antimon. diaphoret. gum. guaiaci, bezoard. orient.</hi> and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diet as drying as he was capable of, purging him as cuſtomary once in four or five days. Thus in the ſpace of eight weeks the <hi>Ozaena</hi> was perfectly cured, and all the Nodes reſolved: but notwithſtanding he complained of pain in all his Limbs, and was ſo weak that he was ſcarce able to go, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned his condition, ſuppoſing he ſhould never be cured. I was of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he was cured, and that thoſe pains proceeded meerly from the ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the muſcles; but I referred it to a conſultation, where it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red poſitively, that he was not Cured, and that he ought to ſalivate again. Theſe propoſals diſmay'd the Patient, and diſturbed me not a little, for in truth he was too weak to ſalivate. I perſiſted in my former Opinion, and prevailed with the Patient to retire two or three miles into the air, and there to drink a decoction of <hi>Sarſa, &amp;c.</hi> with Milk, and to give himſelf liberty to feed upon meats of good nouriſhment, and adviſed him to bathe in milk and water ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. He did ſo, and I ſupplyed him with papers of ingredients to make the decoction, alſo with a lenitive Electuary of <hi>Caſſia, tamarinds, manna,</hi> &amp;c. to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95669:282"/>keep his body ſoluble. In a few weeks he grew fleſhy, his pains waſted, and from that time he enjoyed a good health many years.</p>
                        <p>One about twenty eight years of Age was afflicted with an <hi>Ozaena</hi> of an old date.<note place="margin">58. Obſervation.</note> It had perforated the <hi>ſeptum,</hi> and caſt forth ſome rotten bones, one whereof he ſhewed me. He had alſo Nodes on both his legs and on his right arm. He was emaciated by reaſon of his continual pains, and the much Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick he had unſucceſsfully taken. I injected a <hi>decoct. hordei, &amp;c.</hi> into his noſtrils, and after the cruſty matter ſeparated I preſcribed him an Errhine to ſnuff up his noſtrils often in a day. And having reſolved to ſalivate him by Unction I diſpoſed his body thereto by Clyſters, Lenitive Bolus's, (to which latter I added <hi>calomel.</hi> to take off his pains) and preſcribed him <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> with milk, alſo a liberty in diet, and bathed him the while. Having thus ſomewhat recruited his ſprits, I cauſed him to be anointed, legs, arms, hips, and ſhoulders, till I had raiſed a Salivation. Then I kept him to Poſſet-drink and Broath. I alſo allowed him a pint of Ale daily, ſometimes burnt Wine or other Cordials by which he was enabled to ſalivate near a month. During that time the <hi>Ozaena</hi> cured, and ſome of the Nodes reſolved. As the Salivation declined I purged him with the bitter decoction, and then put him into a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct. ſarſae,</hi> and ſweat him with diaphoreticks, and purged him once in four or five days, he obſerving the while a ſtrict diet. After all I bathed him again a week or ten days, and permitted him a noriſhing diet, and kept his body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble <hi>cum elect. noſt. laxativo ex caſſia, pulp. tamarind. manna, &amp;c.</hi> Some of his Nodes remained till I bathed him; but if they had not then reſolved, yet I ſhould not have doubted of his being well cured. For it doth ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that great Nodes dry and harden into ſuch an <hi>exoſtiſis</hi> as will not yield to any remedy. And indeed they being without pain we need not be ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in their removal, for beyond Sea I have ſeen ſome well cured, the Nodes continuing upon their legs knotted like a Crab-tree-ſtick.</p>

She importuned me to put her in a courſe of Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Unction, and took a lodging near me. I thought it neceſſary enough for her, and told her I would prepare her body for it, and conſult her Phyſician in the manner of ſalivating her. Accordingly I let her blood, then purged her with a ſolution of <hi>manna</hi> and <hi>cremor tartari</hi> in poſſet-drink, and bathed her four or five times; then gave her alternately two or three doſes of <hi>calomel.</hi> to try how the Flux would riſe. But ſhe growing impatient in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay ſent for a Phyſician, to whom ſhe related the original of her Diſeaſe, and that ſhe had taken the ſpitting Pills formerly unſucceſsfully, therefore deſired to ſalivate by Unction. Some objection was made againſt it, as doubting her <hi>viſcera</hi> were naught. But he complyed, and promiſed to viſit her as occaſion ſhould require. I ſent her a pot of Unction the next day, wherewith her legs and arms were anointed, and ſhe returned to her warm bed and was diſpoſed to a breathing ſweat by a draught of Poſſet-drink. By this method the Salivation was raiſed and ſhe fluxed moderately about 20 days, during which her pains remitted, the Nodes reſolved, and ſhe recovered the uſe of her hands. The Cancer lay alſo quiet. The Salivation declining ſhe was purged with the bitter decoction, and ſome days after drank a <hi>ſarſa</hi> drink, and ſweat. In the going off of her Flux ſhe complained of a ſhortneſs of breath, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſubject to fainting.

His Noſe was alſo dreſſed daily, as hath been ſhewed in the like caſe. In the declination of the Flux, I purged him with the bitter decoction, and preſcribed a ſtrict drying Diet, <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> purging and ſweating, and diſmiſt him cured of the <hi>Ozaena,</hi> and the Nodes and Pains reſolved. But ſome months after he relapſing came to me again, and acknowledged that he had not been ſo regular in his Diet as I had directed (and in truth I had heard he had bragged of it) and that he would enter into a new Courſe of Phyſick. I let him blood, and purged him ſix or ſeven dayes with the bitter decoction, then vomited him with <hi>turbith minerale</hi> three or four times, preſcribing Clyſters between while. After I had thus heated his Chaps, and diſpoſed the matter for Sudorificks, I put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a decoction of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> and with <hi>merc. diaphoret.</hi> ſweat him twice a day, and kept him to a ſtrict drying diet, and by this method I cured and ſecured him from relapſe; and ſo ſhall do as many as will ſubmit to it: an inſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be ſeen in many of theſe Obſervations.<note place="margin">62.

                        <p>A Man of about thirty ſix years of Age came to me with an <hi>Ozaena,</hi> Ulcers in both the Tonſils, and Nodes, with pains in ſeveral parts of his Body, which together had extreamly emaciated and weakened him. I ſyringed his Noſe with a lenient Lotion according to my cuſtom, and afterwards preſcribed ſome of the other <hi>Errhina</hi> for daily deterſion. I alſo dreſſed the Tonſils with <hi>lac ſublimati.</hi> In order to his Cure, I let him blood, and preſcribed a Clyſter, and that very night ſent him ℈j. <hi>merc. praecipitat. albi,</hi> which he took in a ſpoonful of white bread and milk, and repeated the giving of it three or four nights af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one another, carrying it off by Clyſters daily. During which I allowed him medicated Broaths, Poſſet-ale, and a Pearl julep. After I had thus diſpoſed his Ulcers to digeſtion, ſo as that he was in a capacity to eat meat, I permitted him to eat ſuch as was of good nouriſhment, and preſcribed him a decoction of <hi>Sarſa, &amp;c.</hi> with an addition of Milk to drink daily, and every other morning gave him a few grains of <hi>Theriac metaltor.</hi> in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>conſ. meliſſae,</hi> and thereby vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited him moderately, And purged him once or twice, and continued the uſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95669:283"/>of Clyſters accordingly as I ſaw cauſe, and bathed him often, I ſuppoſe eight days. Thus I removed his pains, and cured the Ulcers, and purpoſed to have put him into a ſtrict Diet, and to have finiſhed the courſe by Sudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſome of the Nodes remaining, and the Patient having long before met with great difficulty in his Cure, earneſtly importuned me to ſalivate him by uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alledging it the ſure way to prevent relapſe. I ſeeing his deſire, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it might be reaſonable, did comply with him, and cauſed his Legs and Arms to be anointed daily till his cheeks ſwelled. Then I kept him to Poſſet-drink and Broath, and took care in the waſhing his mouth. He ſalivated well about ſixteen or ſeventeen dayes, but then growing weak and faint, I cauſed his feet and legs to be bathed with warm water, and freſh linen to be put on, and by Clyſters diſpoſed the matter downwards, and kept up his Spirits with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. Having thus refreſht him I purged him proportionably to his ſtrength, and finiſhed the Cure by a courſe of drying diet, <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> Sudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in three weeks. But he being extreamly pained in all his Limbs ſuſpected his Cure, but the Nodes being reſolved, and the Ulcers ſo long before cured, I encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to take his wonted noriſhment, ſuppoſing theſe proceeded from the emaciation of the muſcles; yet I preſcribed him a medicated Ale, and adviſed bathing a few days: he did ſo, and found as his ſtrength recovered ſo his pains leſſened. He removed afterwards to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he enjoyed his health and a quiet mind, till one night upon change of lodgings he was bitten with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketoes, and ſeeing his face next morning ſo ſwelled, he conſulted Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, who would needs perſwade him it was Venereal, but it proving otherwiſe he eſcaped the grand Courſe, but was bathed often.</p>
                        <p>A Woman of about forty ſix years of Age was commended into my hands,<note place="margin">63. Obſervation of a <hi>Gumma,</hi>
                           </note> The hairy ſcalp on the <hi>os frontis</hi> had been ſome while ulcerated, and the bone corrupted the compaſs of a broad ſhilling. I laid it open by a circular inciſion, and dreſſed it up dry. The ſecond day after I took off the dreſſings, and ſaw the bone full of a looſe fleſh ariſing out of the cavities. I ſcraped the bone, and dreſſed it up with <hi>unguent.

He was let blood, and purged four or five days with the bitter decoction, and took every other night ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> After I had thus purged him, I laid open the Ulcer by a circular abſciſſion, and dreſſed it up dry. The ſecond day I opened it again, and ſcraped the bone and looſe fleſh off, and applyed doſſils preſſed

Whereupon he removed unknown to me to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ale-houſe ſome diſtance off. Walking thither in a cold winter day to a Lodging as cold, the ſalivation checked, and a ſhortneſs of breath with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fainting followed, and increaſing upon him he died in ſpite of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and thoſe I conſulted.</p>
                        <p>A Man aged forty four years,<note place="margin">66. Obſervation of a <hi>Caries</hi> in the <hi>Os frontis.</hi>
                           </note> of a Plethorick Body, half a year after he had been Cured of a Chancre, began to complain of a pain in the ſore-part of his Head. A Tumour appearing in that part ſome time after, he conſulted a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, who open'd it by inciſion, and dreſſed it with a doſſil of lint, and left him to his Chirurgeon to cure: But in progreſs of time the Ulcer inlarging, and the bone growing more carious, the Patient conſulted another Chirurgeon, who told him it was the work of Nature, and that in time the bone would caſt off. The poor Man believing what was ſaid, took care to have it dreſt accordingly by the ſame young Chirurgeon, till the <hi>Caries</hi> had infected the bone almoſt the whole length from the coronal ſuture to the brows. And then he came to me for Cure, and having lodged himſelf near me, I went to dreſs him, and ſaw a great diſcharge of a ſetid matter, and the lips of the Ulcer lying hollow over the rotten bone. I cut them off round ſo far as the bone lay carious under them, then dreſſed up the wound and bone with doſſils of dry lint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then knowing that there was no hopes of curing him without the uſe of Antivene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reals, I ordered a Clyſter that evening, and began the next morning to purge him with an infuſion of <hi>ſena, rhab. &amp;c.</hi> (for I had permitted him to bleed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in the extirpation of the callous lips.) The third day I renewed dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſaw a pulſation of the <hi>dura mater</hi> through ſeveral ſmall apertures in the carious bone. Upon ſight whereof I had thoughts of ſetting on a Trepan, but there being no immediate danger, I proceeded with Mercurials, and gave him ℈j. <hi>Calomel.</hi> that night, and purged it off the next morning with a draught of the bitter decoction, and repeated the ſame Apozeme four or five days, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>Calomel.</hi> every other night. Whilſt I was purging him the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded much, and flowed downwards into a remaining <hi>ſinus</hi> between his brows, to prevent which, I made a bandage with good compreſſion on that part, and dreſſed the rotten bone with doſſils preſſed out of <hi>ſp. vini,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued that method of dreſſing daily. And that I might haſten the exfoliation and cure of this Ulcer, I gave him the morning after <hi>Turb. min.</hi> gr. xij. which both vomited and purged him. I repeated it once in two or three days till I had raiſed a ſalivation, during which the ſinuous Ulcer healed by agglutination, and the matter accordingly leſſened daily, and loſt its fetid ſmell; the bone alſo caſt off in its circumference, and looſened in the middle, ſo that I brake thoſe forementioned apertures into one another, and raiſed up one piece of the <hi>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> conſiſting of both tables, and made way for the Callus to thruſt off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſides of the bone, part whereof caſt off ſoon after, and the Ulcer incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and is now cicatrizing. There was a Node upon the right jaw, which is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved. The Patient is yet in a Courſe of Diet-drink, ſweating and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in order to the confirmation of the Cure, which I think there is no doubt of.</p>
                        <p>A Man of about thirty four years of Age was commended to my Care.<note place="margin">67. Obſervation of Ulcers and Nodes, with the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note> He had ſeveral Nodes on his Legs and Arms, one whereof upon his right Leg was big and much inflamed. He had alſo ſome breakings out about ſeveral parts of his body, and <hi>Caries</hi> in both his jaws. He had paſſed through many hands, and came then out of a ſalivation raiſed by ſome Mercurial Pill, and (as he ſaid) had ſpit
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95669:284"/>between 4 and 5 quarts a day the ſpace of three weeks. I deſigned ſalivation by unction. In preparation thereto I let him blood, purged and bathed him, then cauſed his Legs and Arms to be anointed till his Chaps ſwelled, and the ſalivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aroſe moderately; then I put him to the drinking Poſſet-ale and Broath, and took care of his mouth. All things thus likely to ſucceed well, I having a Command to make a Journey of four or five days into the Countrey, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him into careful hands, purpoſing at my return to raiſe the ſalivation higher, if there were occaſion. About the ſixth day after, at my return, I found my Patient much indiſpoſed with a ſhortneſs of breath, and frequent fainting. The ſwelling in his Face was ſunk, yet was his mouth much ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and his jaws ſo contracted, that he could ſcarce open them to take in a ſpoonful of broath. His ſpitting checked, his body coſtive, and the urine he made was little and high coloured. I cauſed a Clyſter preſently to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and ſent for a quart of <hi>aq. antiſyph.</hi> of which I gave him ſome, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the taking it once in two or three hours. I ſyringed his mouth with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct. hordei, liquiritiae, &amp; mel. magiſt.</hi> and put a folded rag between his jaws, which I had before adviſed his Nurſe; but ſhe was one of his chuſing, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in this work.</p>
                        <p>I alſo adviſed him to hold ſome of the gargle often in his mouth as hot as he could endure it, and made up a mixture of ſome <hi>mel magiſtralis</hi> with <hi>ſp. vitrioli</hi> to dreſs ſome other of the Ulcers which required deterſion. I alſo preſcribed him a Lambitive of <hi>ol. amygd. dul.</hi> &amp;c. to help expectoration. The next day I purged him with a <hi>decoct. tamarind. caſſiae fiſtul. ſenae,</hi> &amp;c. to which was added <hi>ſyr de roſ. ſolut. manna, ſyr de ſp. cervina,</hi> and repeated it the ſecond and third days. It wrought moderately, and ſomewhat relieved him. In the waſhing his mouth with a ſyringe forcibly, I put him upon excreating a great quantity of a filthy matter, amongſt which there ſeemed ſomewhat like that we call pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent. I not imagining whence it ſhould come, indeed never having ſeen the like, conſulted Doctor <hi>Denton,</hi> who adviſed me to purge him with <hi>Barnet</hi>-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a quart or more at a time, with a ſpoonful or more of <hi>ſyr. de ſpina cervina</hi> in the firſt draught, and ſo to proceed accordingly as it paſſed. I did ſo, and obſerving it to paſs both by urine and ſtool; I repeated the uſe of it five or ſix days, and the while kept up his ſtrength with good Broaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After I had thus emptied his bowels, that diſcharge of matter ceaſed, and he recovered. Then I bathed him, and preſcribed him medicated broaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> and kept his body ſoluble by lenient purgatives once in three days.</p>
                        <p>By the frequent ſyringing and gargling his mouth, and dreſſing the Ulcers I healed that, but by reaſon of the contraction of his Jaws, the ulceration and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> increaſing upon the old diſeaſed parts of the Jaws ſome of his teeth dropt out, and at laſt I was forced to cut the contracted Callus, and that way enlarged his Jaws. Whilſt theſe various accidents affected the <hi>Viſcera</hi> internally, his Nodes and Pains diſcuſſed, his skin alſo was freed of its foulneſs, and he ſeemed perfectly cured; yet to ſecure him from relapſing, I prevailed with him to continue his Diet-drink, and to ſweat with <hi>autimon. diaphoret. &amp;c.</hi> and to purge between while. To which purpoſe I ſupplyed him with Materials, and he retired a few miles out of Town, and proſecuted the Courſe, and came from thence to Town well fleſht, and enjoys a good health to this day.</p>
                        <p>A Man aged forty eight years, having been long diſeaſed in the Country,<note place="margin">68.

He had Nodes upon his Arms, Hands, and Fingers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had no uſe of them. His other Limbs were affected with pain. He had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95669:285"/>an <hi>ozaena</hi> of an old date, whence ſeveral rotten bones had caſt off. His Jaws were alſo carious. There was ſmall hopes of his recovery, yet we were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attempt it ſome way, and in order thereto Lodgings were provided for him near me, and we began his courſe of Phyſick with an <hi>infuſ. ſenae, rhab. &amp;c.</hi> but his ſtomach was ſo weak that he had of long time nauſeated all ſorts of ſuſtenance, and vomited this potion. Upon notice whereof we preſcribed him <hi>ſal vitrioli,</hi> and emptied his ſtomach of much viſcous flegm. A Clyſter was adminiſtred that evening, and we laid him to reſt that night with an anodyne draught. The next morning he was let blood in the Arm, and purged the day after with a ſoulution of <hi>manna, crem. tartar.</hi> in a draught of Poſſet-drink, and the next day we bathed him in water luke-warm: he fainted in it, and was ſeized with a ſhortneſs of breath after he was in bed, which lafted about an hour; yet we proceeded in the bathing him daily the ſpace of a week, and relieved him in thoſe fits with Cordial-waters, and kept his body ſoluble by Clyſters. Having thus prepared him for other remedies, we preſcribed him <hi>calomel.</hi> but which way ſoever he took it, he vomited it ſoon after. We then ſent a pot of <hi>unguent. Neapolit.</hi> by a ſervant who rub'd part of it on his Arms, Thighs and Legs, and diſpoſed him afterwards to a breathing ſweat with a draught of Poſſet-drink: Thus he was anointed ſeveral mornings, till his chaps ſwelled and his mourth ulcerated. Then we took care in waſhing his mouth with lenient decoctions, and nouriſhed him with medicated Broaths and Poſſet-ale, permitting him ſometime to take a little burnt Wine, <hi>aqua the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacalis mag.</hi> to ſupport his ſpirits. By which method he ſalivated 26 days, and was freed of his pains; the nodes alſo reſolved, and he recovered the uſe of his hands, and the rotten bones caſt off from the <hi>eithmoides,</hi> &amp;c. The Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation declining, the bitter apozeme was preſcribed him. Decoctions of <hi>ſarſa</hi> with an addition of a little <hi>aqua mirabilis</hi> was alſo allowed: But our Patient had been obſtinate and ungovernable in the whole courſe, and was now at laſt ſo averſe to every thing was preſcribed him, that in truth he neither purged, drank his diet-drink or ſweat as he ought; and through that omiſſion the ſerous humours abounded, and began firſt to ſwell his Legs, then his Thighs, and ſomewhat his Belly. His Arms and Hands afterwards ſwelled, and at laſt his Eye-lids and Face, and an Itch brake out over all his body, which by his rubbing and ſcratching excoriated the skin in ſeveral parts, and was very vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious to him. At the firſt appearance of theſe anaſarcous ſwellings, various internals were preſcribed, but he only took Cordial-waters, in which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſometimes purgatives, whereof this following was one: ℞ <hi>Spec. diamoſch. amari</hi>

The Ulcers in the Tonſils and Noſe were large, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with inflammations and tumour, and thereby occaſioned a great difficulty in ſwallowing his drink, the moſt part of it running out at his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils. On the ridge of his Noſe there was a <hi>herpes exedens</hi> with a <hi>caries</hi> in that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95669:285"/>bone, and upon the left ſide of his Noſtril another, which had penetrated through that cartilage, and an <hi>ozaena</hi> within which had corrupted part of the <hi>ethmoides</hi> and the lower part of the <hi>ſeptum,</hi> inſomuch as there only remained the exteriour skin to divide the Noſtrils, and that being ulcerated could not defend it ſelf long from being eaten in pieces. He had alſo ſome Nodes upon his Legs, but the Ulcers in his Noſe were they which threatned the danger, yet there were hopes of curing them if a courſe were ſpeedily taken. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſomewhat ſatisfied, and the next day ſent for two eminent Phyſicians, and procured leave for me of my Keeper to meet them. I repreſentd the condition of the Ulcers to the Phyſicians, and propoſed to them the raiſing a Salivation by unction as the ſpeedieſt way to prevent the farther eroſion. They had no great opinion of Salivating, but did comply with me, and promiſed the Patient to viſit him often during courſe.</p>
                        <p>The Patient had been let blood, and purged by their preſcriptions; upon which conſideration I preſcribed him ℈j. <hi>Calomel.</hi> in a ſpoonful of white bread and milk to take that night, and adviſed them to bath him the next day; alſo to repeat the <hi>Calomel.</hi> for ſome nights, hoping thereby to check the corroſive quality in the Ulcers; and I alſo adviſed to repeat his bathing in order to the ſalivation I intended by the unction. Care was alſo taken to keep his body ſoluble by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or lenient Bolus's. I directed one of my Servants to dreſs the Ulcers, ſome with lenients, and others with deterſives.</p>
                        <p>Whileſt the Ulcers were thus diſpoſing to Cure, my liberty was procured, and I again attended the Patient; and having prepared all things ready, began to raiſe the ſalivation by anointing his Legs, Arms, Shoulders, Spine and Hips, and repeated it daily, and afterwards put him into a warm bed, and diſpoſed him to a breathing ſweat, with a draught of butter'd Ale to gratifie his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. The reſt of the day he drank Poſſet-drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> During the anointing, ſome of the Lotions were ſyringed twice or thrice a day into his noſtrils. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles were alſo uſed to waſh his throat, and the Ulcers of the Tonſils and <hi>uvula</hi> touched with <hi>lac ſublimati.</hi> Thoſe Ulcers without were deterged and ſmoothed fit to heal, as Nature ſhould be diſpoſed thereto. And that little bit of skin which ſerved to divide the noſtrils likewiſe healed.</p>
                        <p>I continued anointing this Patient till I had waſted near three pounds and a half of the unction, yet his Chaps would not ſwell, nor did he ſpit a quart in 24 hours. But during this anointing he was freed of his pains, and the Ulcers cured as well as I could deſire. But how far this would ſerve to eradicate ſuch an inveterate <hi>Lues,</hi> I much doubted. The Phyſicians ſeemed alſo to diſtruſt my undertaking, conſidering I did not ſalivate him as I had propoſed. The Patient alſo became weary of the frequent anointing. Upon which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I was ſomewhat troubled, and endeavoured by Clyſters to move it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wiſhing it would end in a <hi>Diarrhoea;</hi> but it not moving that way, nor any other way diſturbing him, I concluded his not ſalivating to proveed from the quantity of Mercury he had formerly taken, and that poſſibly it was become habitual to him. Suppoſing it might be ſo, I cauſed ſome Mercurial Emplaſters to be applyed to his Feet, Legs and Arms, and ſweat him again in his Bed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately. And after theſe, ſeeing the Salivation not yet ariſe, I gave him <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith min.</hi> gr. xvj. in a Pill with <hi>conſ. boraginis.</hi> It vomited him twice or thrice inconſiderably. But from that time he began to be ſevouriſh and faint, and the matter much indiſpoſed, by which I judged it neceſſary to purge off. To which purpoſe a Clyſter was adminiſtred, and the Plaſters taken off, and freſh linen put on. He took the bitter decoction five or ſix days, making large evacuation that way. During which his mouth was frequently waſhed, and diſpoſed to Cure; and I put him into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> and ſtrict diet, ſweating him with <hi>antimon.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95669:286"/>diaphoret. &amp;c.</hi> as before hath been preſcribed in ſuch like caſes. I continued him a month in this Courſe, and being then ſatisfied that he was well Cured, and ſecured from further relapſe, the Phyſicians were ſent for, and ſaw the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ulcers cicatrized; that on the ridge of his Noſe where the bone had been bare was healed ſmooth without any viſible exfoliation. If the Cartilage on the ſide of the Noſtril did exfoliate, it was caſt off into the Noſtril, for the cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix lay cloſe and tranſverſe as a ſmall ſeam. Within his Noſe there was a great vacuity, but nothing of <hi>Caries</hi> or bare bone, nor did he blow any thing of filth as formerly he had done. And that his Palate and Tonſils were as well, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared both by his voice, eating and drinking. His Legs were alſo as free from Nodes as pains. The Phyſicians judged him Cured, yet would not yield the Cure to the Salivation: but in other caſes of that kind, where I afterwards propoſed Salivation, they would reply upon me, that I did not Salivate ſuch a one, meaning this Patient: To which I alway anſwered, The Cure conſiſts not ſo much in the ſpitting a great quantity, as in putting the matter upon ſuch a ferment as might fit it to be carried off by the Sudorificks, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Perſon retired afterwards into the Countrey, and returned to <hi>London</hi> at the end of two years, and acknowledged to me his Cure by ſetling Thirty Pounds a year upon me during his Life, and paid me Sixty Pounds for the two years paſſed.</p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant that there are a people who pretend to Cure all the forementioned Species of <hi>Lues Venerea</hi> without running ſuch long Courſes, or keeping their Chamber: But it is their undertakings which make us ſo much work; yet truly, I do believe, that all thoſe who are of a fleſhy and ſtrong Conſtitution, may be Cured without Salivating by Unction, if they would patiently ſubmit to ſo ſtrict a Courſe of Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as that way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>

                     <p>The Antients have confined that appellation to a loſs of Seed which happens without erection or <hi>tentigo;</hi> or if you will have it in <hi>Celſus</hi> his words, <hi>ſine venere vel nocturnis imaginibus.</hi> But Moderns have given a larger account of <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and do find many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which cometh from fault in the matter of the Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 1. when it is too crude, thin and cold, and ſo weeps away inſenſibly; 2. when it is ſharp and comes away either with titillation or pain; ſometime to the ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> and the excoriation of it; 3. when it is infected with a virulency in the <hi>Lues Venerea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is this latter <hi>ſpecies</hi> that is the moſt uſual imployment of our profeſſion, the diſeaſes of thoſe parts being moſt frequently gotten by the too predominant vice of the age. I ſhall therefore confine my diſcourſe to that ſubject, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is one of the firſt ſymptoms of the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> but alſo for that through the Patients ſlighting and neglecting its cure, many ill accidents do happen in proceſs of time, which renders it much more difficult to cure than any other <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Pox.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A virulent</hi> Gonorrhoea <hi>is an involuntary emiſſion of ſeed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Definition.</note> 
                        <hi>occaſioned by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom contracted from an unclean woman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seed thus emitted is doubly peccant, both in <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>quality.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> is alway proportionable to the degree of the infection and to the encreaſe of putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>quantity</hi> is likewiſe always far greater than veſſels in their natural eſtate are able to breed or to diſcharge, which hath cauſed a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among Phyſicians about the ſeat of this diſeaſe, or the original of it. And indeed it is very odd to conſider that a man upon coition ſhall ſometimes have nothing outwardly appear upon him, either by way of chancre, <hi>bubo,</hi> or any other evil, but ſhall find his urine hot, with a flux of ſharp and acrimonious ſeed from within, the continuance of which ſhall ſpend his ſtrength, erode
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95669:287"/>the <hi>urethra,</hi> make caruncles and other miſchiefs. On the contrary, if ſtopped, ſhall cauſe inflammations in the teſticles, or elſe a <hi>bubo</hi> or chancre; and if theſe happen not, ſhall infect the whole body, breaking out in ſcabs and ulcers, or making nodes, intolerable pains, rotting the bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where this venom ſhould enter, what parts it ſhould originaly infect, and how inſinuate it ſelf, and afterwards cauſe ſuch great ſeparations of ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is worth our while to enquire.</p>
                     <p>The way of its entrance in a woman is intelligible enough, but in a man it can be no other than either the paſſage of the <hi>urethra,</hi> or the pores of the skin of the <hi>penis, pubes</hi> and <hi>inguina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former ſeemeth not very likely,<note place="margin">Manner of contracting it, 1. In Men,</note> becauſe it is not ſuitable to many other circumſtances of the diſeaſe, which doth ſeldom or never originaly infect the <hi>urethra</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>proſtatae, &amp;c.</hi> and never aſcends into the bladder; whereas on the other ſide we find viſible affections of the <hi>glans, praeputium, inguina, &amp;c.</hi> to be the firſt effects of the infection.</p>
                     <p>We have therefore reaſon to believe that the venom lurking in the <hi>vagina uteri</hi> of an infected woman, doth upon the friction and warmth that happens in coition faſten upon thoſe parts which it toucheth, <hi>viz.</hi> If it ly high within the <hi>vagina,</hi> or the <hi>penis</hi> enter not far in coition, the <hi>glans</hi> and prepuce ſuffer to the production of a Chancre. If the coition were cloſer, and the venom have poſſeſſed the <hi>labia pudendi,</hi> then the whole skin of the <hi>penis</hi> is infected, and the <hi>pubes</hi> it ſelf; where inſinuating into thoſe pores, it doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo viſible effects as it doth in the prepuce and <hi>glans,</hi> becauſe the skin is thicker. But then it is tranſmitted not only into the maſs of blood in general, but alſo into the ſpungy glandules of the <hi>inguina</hi> in particular. If theſe or either of theſe be ſufficiently ſwelled, and nature ſtrong, the venom may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge here; but if this happen not, then it creeps into the blood, and there produceth fermentations ſuitable to its nature. The matter of the venom being originally corrupted ſeed, doth therefore raiſe ſeminal fermentations, but withall one that is peccant after the nature of the venom that excited it; by which means it happens that ſpermatick matter of a vitious ſort abounds in the blood, exhauſts it of its beſt ſpirits, and derives the flower of it to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal veſſels. This matter is too much and too ſharp to be long contained there, where it immediately provokes and ſtimulates nature to an excretion; and according to the degree of its acrimony and corruption the ſeed will be more or leſs, thicker or thinner, white, yellow, green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know <hi>Bartholinus</hi> hath made a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> to be nothing elſe, but an Ulcer of the <hi>proſtatae.</hi> Which Opinion is ſufficiently confuted by Doctor <hi>Wharton,</hi> who gives him the inſoluble objection of the Tumour of the Teſticles, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth alway upon the untimely ſtopping of it. <hi>By the pounding up of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is eaſie to find which way the current came.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Women,<note place="margin">2. In Women.</note> the manner of the Infection is much more intelligible. Where the Infection of a corrupt venemous Seed enters into an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> that is heated partly by coition, and partly by its own appetite, it is greedily ſucked in, and as fatally to the misfortune of the Woman. There its firſt attacque is upon the innermoſt or glandulous membrane of the Womb, uſually acuating its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cauſing a large precipitation of <hi>ſerum</hi> from the blood. This is at firſt by modeſt Women miſtaken for a <hi>fluor albus</hi> (unleſs the matter have been ſo highly virulent as to cauſe immediate inflammations) and is ſo treated till worſe Symptoms ariſe, and all is betrayed. What thoſe are, we have already ſhewed you in part, and more will appear hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The preceding ſign of it is heat in Urine,<note place="margin">Signs of it in Men;</note> then ſucceedeth the Diſeaſe it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> an iſſuing of white matter in ſmall quantity, which by degrees increaſeth,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95669:287"/>and groweth more corrupt and virulent, changing its colour ſomewhat to a yellow or green: and about this time it is accompanied with a painfull ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for the moſt part with a contraction or pricking in the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>fraenum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Women alſo heat of Urine is felt with a dropping of matter from the Womb, at firſt reſembling a <hi>fluor albus,</hi> but after a few days it increaſeth,<note place="margin">In Women.</note> and becometh purulent and fetid, with diverſity of colours, making an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with excoriation; alſo a bearing down of thoſe parts, and pain in the back.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> is more or leſs difficult of Cure,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> according to the malignity from which it received its Original. Thoſe that become ſuddenly virulent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>ſtranguria,</hi> are moſt difficult to Cure. If they do ſtop with out any manifeſt cauſe, either a Chancre ariſeth, or a <hi>hernia humoralis.</hi> If the Cure be ſlubber'd over, or long delayed, caruncles ariſe in the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and in progreſs of time a carnoſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Cure of this Diſeaſe,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> we ought to have a ſpecial regard to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents above-mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> inflammation, excoriation, <hi>ſtranguria, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place, we endeavour to contemperate the heat, then purge off the vicious humours; afterwards by moderate detergents and deſiccants cleanſe and dry the diſeaſed parts, and reſtore them to their natural temper.</p>
                     <p>In order to the contemperating of the heat, and acrimony of the humours, a cooling and moiſtening diet ought to be preſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> Broaths of Mutton, Veal, Chicken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein may be boiled Endive, Lettice, Purſlane, Sorrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Barly-cream, Grewels, Panados are alſo proper during the pains. Their drink ought to be Ptiſans, Emulſions, Juleps, or medicated Ale: a ſmall Ale, or white Wine diluted with water may alſo be permitted.</p>
                     <p>All exerciſe of the Body is prejudicial to their healths, and conſequently their rambling abroad prolongs their Cure.</p>
                     <p>A quiet mind, with a patient ſubmiſſion to their Phyſician and Chirurgeon is alſo required: and that they forbear Venery, as they value their own and their Miſtris's healths.</p>
                     <p>The Evacuation may begin with a Clyſter of the common decoction <hi>cum ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuario lenitiv.</hi> ℥ij. <hi>butyri recentis &amp; ol. amygdal. an.</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>cum vitel. ovi.</hi> You may afterwards let them blood in the Arm if you judge it neceſſary.

                     <p>After purging, it will be neceſſary to diſpoſe the humors to quiet by ſome anodyne draught: Emulſions are alſo proper during the whole Courſe. Of which ſort this may be an Example. ℞ <hi>ſem. canabini</hi> ℥jſs. <hi>ſem. quat. frig. maj. an.</hi>

                     <p>If after the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> be cured, you ſuſpect you have not enough ſecured the Patient from the malignity of the Diſeaſe, you may purge him with ſome of the forementioned Catharticks with <hi>Calomel.</hi> after which you may proceed with Sudorificks; as hath been ſhewed in the former Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>One came to me,<note place="margin">1. Obſervation of <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi>
                        </note> complaining of a heat in his Urine, with a ſuſpicion of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> contracted as he ſuppoſed the night before. Upon view of the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> there appeared a redneſs on the end of the <hi>glans,</hi> and he cruſht out a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture like matter. I concluding it a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> began the cure without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. In the firſt place I let him blood, and ſome hours after adminiſtred a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. I preſcribed him that night a barly-cream for his ſupper, and in the morning purged him with <hi>manna</hi> and <hi>cremor tartar.</hi> in Whey. The next morning the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> appeared viſibly, and his Linen was much ſtained with the matter. We repeated the hordeat that night, and preſcribed him ℈j. <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel. conſ. cichor.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. <hi>mſ.</hi> which he took early in the morning, and about three hours after a draught of the <hi>decoct. tamarindor. &amp;c.</hi> as it is preſcribed in the Method of Cure, and ſome hours after that drank ſo much more of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, by which he was well purged. That night I laid him to reſt with an anodyne draught. The next morning I found the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> increaſed with heat in Urine and painful erections. I repeated the former Apozeme, and to prevent eroſion I injected the <hi>decoct. hordei,</hi> as is above mentioned, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at night the anodyne draught: but finding the accidents ſtill to encreaſe I preſcribed him the morning after <hi>calomel. gr.</hi> 15. <hi>turbith gr.</hi> 6. with <hi>conſ. roſ.</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95669:288"/>in a <hi>bolus,</hi> with a draught of Poſſet-drink after it: and in caſe he vomited, to drink Poſſet-ale after each vomit. But he had formerly taken much Mercury, and this doſe moved him little. A Clyſter was adminiſtred that afternoon, and at night an emulſion <hi>ex ſem. canabin. &amp;c.</hi> which he had liberty to drink as often as he pleaſed in the night. The ſecond day after I repeated <hi>turbith min.</hi> The next morning I perceived a remiſſion of pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I imputed to the mercurial doſe, and would gladly have repeated ſomewhat of that kind: but to avoid fluxing I purged him the day after with <hi>pul. cornichini;</hi> it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plentifully. I repeated it again the next day with ℈j. <hi>calomel.</hi> and at night he drank the emulſion as before. Thus the virulency and accidents were checked. From that time I purged him with that Electuary of <hi>ſal. prunel. cum terebinth.</hi> but obſerving it to run again I added <hi>pul. jalapii</hi> to it; and by the repeating that, and afterwards the ſame Electuary as it is preſcribed without Jalap, I cured the <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was ſent for to a man grievouſly afflicted with a <hi>Stranguria.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Obſervation.</note> He had been let blood and purged with lenients; he had alſo drank emulſions, and bathed often in a <hi>ſemicupium,</hi> but without remiſſion of pain. Upon this information, and aſſurance that he had not the Stone, I ſuſpected it might ariſe from ſome, <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſuppreſſed, but he would by no means acknowledge that. However I gave him early next morning ℈j. <hi>calomel. cum conſ. cicohrei</hi> in a <hi>bolus,</hi> and a Clyſter that afternoon. It gave him three or four ſtools. That night I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a draught of emulſion. The next morning I found him much relieved. I gave him alternately two doſes more as at firſt, with Clyſters in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons, and continued the uſe of emulſions, and thereby freed him of the <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria.</hi> A day 2 or 3 after he came to me, and ſhewed me a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It had been too ſoon ſtopt by aſtringents, and that cauſed the <hi>ſtranguria;</hi> which now returned again, but with no great malignity. I purged him with the Electuary <hi>ex terebinth. ſal. prunellae cum pul. jalapii,</hi> and afterwards I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Cure with the ſame Electuary <hi>ſine jalapio,</hi> and the <hi>decoct. millefolii, &amp;c.</hi> caſting up an injection at laſt of a ſolution of <hi>mel. Aegyptiac.</hi> in <hi>aqua equiſeti:</hi> by all which he was cured.</p>
                     <p>One came to me diſeaſed with an involuntary effuſion of matter; it ſeemed to me a Venereal <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Obſervation.</note> but he having conſulted others who thought it aroſe from ſome ſcorbutical affection I adviſed him to put himſelf into their hands, my knowledge extending only o the cure of the venereal one: and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be ſo, yet I could not hope to cure it in ſo few days as they had promiſed him. Thus we parted, but after a longer tryal with them than was promiſed, he returned to me again not better than at firſt. Upon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration I undertook to ſerve him as well as I could. He had been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated with lenient purgatives. I began with a doſe of <hi>pul. cornichini,</hi> which purged him at leaſt 15 or 16 times. That night I diſpoſed him to reſt with an anodyne draught. The next day he was leſs pained in making urine, and the running was leſſened. Upon which account I purged him more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, but that way of lenient purging gave way to the encreaſe of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulency; which being alſo obſerved by the Patient, I purged him with more large doſes, and thoſe of the ſtronger Catharticks, <hi>viz. pil. Rudii</hi> with <hi>calomel.</hi> and ſometime with <hi>pul. cornichini,</hi> or the Electuary <hi>ex terebinth. cum jalapio.</hi> By the uſe of this laſt I purged off the <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and ſtopt the running by ſome few doſes of <hi>pil. croci martis aſtringentis.</hi> He continued well about a month, then it relapſed again. Upon ſight whereof I repeated the former courſe, and ſtopt it; yet it brake out afterwards ſeven times for the ſpace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of a year. I cured it as often, by purging him with the Electuary <hi>cum jalapio,</hi> ſo that it continued well at laſt. Whether it was venereal at firſt, I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95669:289"/>cannot affirm: Nay ſo far as I could judge by his habit of body and manner of living, he was not that way inclined; but what way ſoever it proceeded, he was perfectly cured and continueth ſo.</p>
                     <p>I was commended to a Patient who lay much afflicted with a virulent <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea</hi> accompanied with the ſevereſt accidents,<note place="margin">4. Obſervation.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. Priapiſmus</hi> with contraction of the <hi>penis, ſtranguria, &amp;c.</hi> inſomuch that he was neceſſitated to riſe often in a night to cool himſelf. He had been in ſuch hands as had purged him and let him blood. I began with a Clyſter, and the next morning gave him Lenitive Electuary, <hi>diaprun. &amp;c.</hi> with the addition of <hi>calomel.</hi> and bathed him that day, and preſcribed him Emulſions, and proſecuted the foreſaid method of bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and purging 4 or 5 days with little remiſſion of the accidents. Wherefore I left off bathing, and preſcribed him gr. iij. <hi>mer. vitae</hi> in a pill, which vomited him much and purged him. I diſpoſed the Patient to reſt the following night with gr. jſs. <hi>Laudan. aq. cinam. hordeat. &amp; aq. papaver. cum ſyr. paralyſeos.</hi> The next morning I preſcribed him an emulſion made with Chicken broath, as well to nouriſh him as contemperate the acrimony. I alſo repeated emollient Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſuch as hath been ſet down in the Method of Cure. Having thus ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſhed him, I preſcribed him <hi>calomel.</hi> ℈j. <hi>turbith min. gr.</hi> iv. which vomited him twice that day. I kept him to Chicken-broath and Clyſters, and at length repeating theſe Mercurials, I freed him of all thoſe accidents; and with the white Electuary <hi>ex terebinth. cum pul. jalapii</hi> I purged off the <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea,</hi> and with the other <hi>ex terebinth.</hi> the aſtringent Pills, and <hi>decoct. lig. len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcini cum rad. biſtortae, conſolid. tormentillae, &amp;c.</hi> I concluded the Cure. This very man was the moſt ſeverely afflicted with the foreſaid <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> I ever ſaw: yet ſome years after was again clapt, and paſſed under ſeveral hands till the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity ſpread it ſelf all over his head, face and body, and was at laſt Cured by me.</p>
                     <p>One of about 30 years of age of a full body, came to Town diſeaſed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles,<note place="margin">5. Obſervation of <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> with Chancre.</note> intending to be my Patient; but within a day or two after he came to me with a recent <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> contracted the night before. I began the Cure that very inſtant by letting him blood, and preſcribing a Clyſter that afternoon, and proſecuted the courſe by emulſions and purging. But the Patient being irregular, the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> became highly virulent with all the accidents of pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and whilſt he was purging with <hi>pul. cornichini</hi> and <hi>calomel.</hi> a Chancre appeared between the Prepuce and <hi>Glans</hi> very big and hard. He pretended it roſe that night. I gave him the next morning a doſe of <hi>turbith min.</hi> which vomited him 5 or 6 times, and purged him twice. I dreſſed the Chancre with a Pledget dipt in <hi>lac ſublimati,</hi> I repeated the <hi>Turbith</hi> the third day, and afterward again till I ſalivated him, I thinking that way the moſt ſpeedy in ſuch Libertines. During his ſalivating an Artery amongſt the great Teeth on the right Jaw burſt forth, and bled very much before I had notice of it: I ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it by directing him to hold the yolk of hard roaſted Egg between his Jaws cloſe upon the place where I ſuſpected the Artery to lye, and ſo by compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion reſtrained the bleeding. The next day I ſet him in a clear light, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the blood to ariſe by a carious tooth which I ſtopped with Lint dipt in <hi>ol. vitriol.</hi> ſo that it bled no more. During the Salivation the Chancre reſolved, and the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ſtopped. In the declination of the Salivation I purged him with the bitter Apozeme, and afterwards finiſhed the Courſe with <hi>decoct. ſarſae, &amp;c.</hi> ſweating him. Whilſt he was in this courſe of ſweating, the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> appeared again weeping, but the malignity being waſted, I cured it with the white Electuary, and aſtringent Pills.</p>
                     <p>One of about twenty three years of Age came to me with a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Virulency.<note place="margin">6. Obſervation of a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> with Chancre.</note> I adviſed him a Clyſter that Evening, and the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95669:289"/>next morning let him blood, and preſcribed him a laxative ptiſan (as it is ſet down in the method of Cure) to purge him moderately, which he took and repeated three or four days, taking ℈j. <hi>Calomel</hi> every other night. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which I preſcribed a lenient injection of <hi>ſummitat. malvar. violar.</hi> decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>aq. hordei.</hi> Thoſe accidents of pain thus mitigated, I purged him with <hi>pul. cornichini</hi> and <hi>calomel.</hi> and after its operation, I preſcribed him an emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>ex ſem. canabini,</hi> &amp;c. and repeated the uſe of the purgative and emulſion, till I had taken off the virulency. Then I ſent him a Pot of the white Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary <hi>exterebinth. jalap. &amp;c.</hi> and a draught of the emulſion after it each night. During this Courſe, the Patient ſuppoſing himſelf ſecure, took his liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in eating and drinking, till a great inflammation happened on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce, with a ſwelling and excoriation of the <hi>glans,</hi> alſo a large Chancre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prepuce and <hi>glans:</hi> Upon ſight thereof I let him blood, and fomented the prepuce with <hi>decoct. ſummitat. rubi, plantag.</hi> &amp;c. and dreſſed him up as is uſual in ſuch Caſes, and gave him ℥ij. of <hi>manna</hi> with <hi>crem. tartar.</hi> next day in a draught of Poſſet-drink. It purged him ſeven or eight times. The ſecond day after I preſcribed him a Doſe of <hi>turbith,</hi> and a Clyſter that Afternoon, and afterward proceeded in the repeating <hi>turbith. min.</hi> and raiſed a light Salivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which the hardneſs was reſolved, and the Chancre Cured. After which he drank a <hi>decoct. ſarſae,</hi> and obſerved a ſtrict diet, and ſweat, as hath been ſaid in the like caſes. After I had thus Cured him, a weeping of the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared again; it was no more than I expected, it commonly following after ſuch courſes of Phyſick: but there being no malignity in it, the Cure was ſoon effected with that white Electuary <hi>cum terebinth. &amp;c.</hi> and he continued well.</p>
                     <p>A young Woman newly married, complained the ſecond day after of a heat in her Urine, which encreaſing upon her with a <hi>fluor albus,</hi> I was ſent for,<note place="margin">7.

I adviſed her to bathe the excoriated parts with milk and water, and to dreſs them with <hi>unguent. refrigerant. Galeni,</hi> preſcribed her an emollient Clyſter, emulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and took my leave without diſcovering to her the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Diſeaſe. A day or two after, I took an opportunity to acquaint her Husband with what I had obſerved of his Wives condition, and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his health. After a little demur, he told me, he had ſome months paſſed a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and ſuppoſed he had been Cured, but of late, ſince the complaint of his Wife, he had obſerved ſome little weeping, and ſhewed me ſomewhat like the reliques of <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi> It was inconſiderable, yet ſeemed enough to infect her. He put himſelf into my hands, and recommended her alſo to my Care. I let them both blood, and purged her with a laxative ptiſan of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, tamarind.</hi> &amp;c. and ſent her an injection of a ſolution of <hi>lap. medicam. Crollii in aq. plantag.</hi> a dram to a pint, and continued the uſe of emulſions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bathed her ſome days in a <hi>ſemicupium,</hi> and kept her body ſoluble with lenitive Bolus's, to which I added 10 or 12 grains of <hi>praecipitat. alb.</hi> After I had thus contemperated the heat, and healed the external excoriations, I purged her with <hi>deagridium,</hi> and <hi>praecipitatus alb.</hi> ſome days, increaſing the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſent her <hi>decoct. ſummitat. rub. equiſet. plantag.</hi> &amp;c. with a ſolution of <hi>unguent.

After I had thus purged off the malignity, I preſcribed her the purging Bolus of <hi>terebinth. cum pul. jalap.</hi> and afterwards confirmed the Cure with aſtringents, as in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure hath been ſet down. Her Husband was cured by purging with the foreſaid Electuary.</p>
                     <p>They have both enjoyed their healths well ſince, and have Children.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I was Curing one of a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> by purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thought I had Cured him, a Tumour roſe in the left Teſticle.<note place="margin">8. Obſervation.</note> Upon complaint of it I ſent
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95669:290"/>for a Truſs, and the while let him blood in the Arm, and made up a Cataplaſm of <hi>far. hordei &amp; fabar.</hi> with oxycrate, <hi>mel. commune,</hi> and applyed it. That afternoon a Clyſter was adminiſtred, and the uſe of the Cataplaſm was repeated twice a day; during which he was purged with <hi>diagridium</hi> and <hi>calomel.</hi> by the help whereof the Tumour in the Teſticle diminiſhed daily, but by the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>acetum</hi> the <hi>ſcrotum</hi> was heated and bliſtered in ſeveral parts. Upon ſight whereof I directed ſome Vinegar to be prepared with Litharge, and made up a Cataplaſm with it inſtead of the Oxycrate, and applyed that, defending the veſication with pledgets of <hi>unguent. album.</hi> By this Cataplaſm the humour was dryed up, and the Teſticle reſtored to its natural tone; but the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> diſcovering it ſelf in the mean time, I purged it off as is aboveſaid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Cure with the white Electuary, and aſtringent Pills: the Patient drinking a draught of <hi>decoct. lig. guaiaci, lentiſci, &amp;c.</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p>One about eighteen years of Age was afflicted with a ſwelling in his right Teſticle with inflammation and hardneſs.<note place="margin">9.

By the application of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm a few days the Tumour was removed, and reſtored to its natural ſtate, but before this Tumour was quite reſolved, I took occaſion to look upon the <hi>Penis,</hi> and ſaw it running; yet the Patient perſiſted in the denying it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſcribed him ought in order to the Cure, it was more demonſtrable, and he acknowledging it, I purged him with <hi>extract.

The next day a Clyſter was adminiſtred, and the dreſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. The day after he was purged with ℈j. of <hi>calomel.</hi> in a lenitive Bolus. We continued the application of the Cataplaſm till the inflammation and pain relaxed. Then made up a Cataplaſm <hi>ex farin. fabar. hord. &amp;c.</hi> as in the former Obſervation, and from that time I purged him with <hi>pil. cochiae min. &amp; calomel.</hi> and ſupplyed him with a Box of the ſame Pills, and a Pot of that Cataplaſm to dreſs himſelf: and he finding himſelf well mended, removed to his former lodging, and rambled about his affairs. Fifteen or ſixteen days after, when I thought he had been Cured, he came to me with a Callous Chancre on one fide between the <hi>glans</hi> and <hi>fraenum,</hi> the Tumour in <hi>ſcroto</hi> being reſolved. I confined him again to his Lodging, and purged him daily with the foreſaid Pills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and decreaſing the Mercury or Cathartick, till I totally reſolved the Chancre. Then with <hi>decoct. guaiaci</hi> and Sudorificks I concluded the Cure.</p>

                        </note> but whether through irregularity in the Patient, or that they were too haſty in the uſe of aſtringents, however ſo it happened, that upon the ſtopping of the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> a Tumour aroſe between the Teſticles, but it eſpecially affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the left Teſticle, and the <hi>perinaeum</hi> with great inflammation and hardneſs.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95669:290"/>the day after preſcribed him 12 gr. of <hi>turbith. min.</hi> which vomited and purged him well.

I having made dreſſings ready as for the work began with the ulcerated Teſticle, paſſing my director in the <hi>ſinus,</hi> bending it downward, and cut that ſinuoſity open the whole length, then paſſed in my probe Sciſſors to the <hi>ſinus</hi> up ward, and divided that, and by this opening he began to ſhrug, and being made ſenſible of the pain, was well contented that I ſhould dreſs him up, and cure the Teſticle. I complyed, and dreſſed up the Ulcer with doſſils dipt in precipitate, and applyed between the wounded lips <hi>pul. Galeni cum al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamine ovi.</hi> But the blood burſt forth ſo forcibly after I had bound it, that I was neceſſitated to dreſs it again. I did ſo with doſſils dipt in the Royal Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and from that inſtant it bled no more. The ſecond day after I took off the dreſſings, and ſeeing the Ulcer ſordid I dreſſed it with deterſives, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby in few days diſpoſed the Ulcer to Cure, I purged him with <hi>pil. co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae min. &amp; calomel.</hi> and left the finiſhing of the Cure to my Servants, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it accordingly.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the ill Conſequences of a Gonorrhoea Cured.</head>
                     <p>IN the preceding Chapter of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi>
                        </note> I ſhewed you the accidents that Diſeaſe is ſubject to in its recency; I ſhall now declare to you the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that attend it in its ſeeming declenſion, when it is left imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cured, and is, as ſome of thoſe Blades call it, a weeping, only a weeping not worthy the keeping Chamber.</p>
                     <p>From which neglect of Cure, thoſe ſeminals from whence the <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> iſſued are rendered more lax, and in progreſs of time the matter fermenteth upon the old Leven, and becometh much more acrid and malign, diſcharging a matter, as at firſt in the nature of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> heating and corroding the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethra,</hi> from whence Caruncles do frequently ariſe, and are attended with many ill conſequences, of which I ſhall give you a relation, and begin it with that of a Caruncle.</p>
                     <p>Caruncles are a ſort of looſe fleſh,<note place="margin">Caruncles.</note> ariſing in the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ethra</hi> frequently in the time of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> by reaſon of the eroſion made by that virulent arid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if that <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> be well treated, the eroſion is Cured, and thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grains of fleſh dryed up. However their growth is then ſo ſmall, as they are rarely taken notice of till the declining of the <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> and then a ſmall weeping with a few rags appearing in the Urine gives the firſt ſuſpicion of them.</p>
                     <p>If this matter be not timely dryed up, the Caruncles encreaſe, and a difficulty of Urine gradually ſucceedeth, and it cometh forth forked, or in a ſmall ſtream dribling: but this happens in ſome people not till many years after the <hi>Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea;</hi> for they ariſing from a dry membranous part do grow ſlowly (and do ſometimes waſte of themſelves, or are waſhed off by the Urine) upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that trouble in piſſing happening ſometime many years after a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> gives them occaſion to ſuſpect that it ariſeth from gravel; and as the Diſeaſe increaſeth, it is thought the Stone, but by a ſearching candle a more certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is made, thoſe Caruncles being to it ſo many rubs in the way.</p>
                     <p>If at this time their Cure be neglected,<note place="margin">Cornoſity.</note> ſome drops of Urine, or <hi>in coitu</hi> the Seed remaining amongſt theſe Caruncles, heateth the part, and increaſeth their growth, and not only renders <hi>them</hi> Callous, but at length the whole <hi>ductus,</hi> and then it is called a carnoſity; which ſtraitning the paſſage ſtoppeth the virulent matter in its motion, whereby it is forced back to the Seminals, in which caſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles for the moſt part do ſuffer: but if it be the <hi>veſiculae ſeminales,</hi> or proſtates which are oppreſt, they inflame, and by adheſion to the neighbouring parts paſs their matter that way, ſometimes through the tunicles of the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> and then the matter is diſcharged by ſtool; or it may be, the matter paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through or near the <hi>podex,</hi> and then it is ſuppoſed a <hi>fiſtula in ano,</hi> and this way the Urine is ſometime diſcharged with it. Theſe are the Ulcers which render <hi>fiſtulae ani</hi> ſcandalous. If the matter paſſeth <hi>in perinaeo,</hi> for the moſt part it perforates the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> ſometime like a Flute, and the Urine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereout, othertimes it corrupteth within, and diſchargeth the putrefaction into the <hi>pelvis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> is ſtraitned with a carnoſity, the Urine is frequently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and then the bladder endeavouring to disburthen it ſelf becomes ſubject
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95669:291"/>to fluxion, and groweth ſometime carnous, and of a ſtrange preternatural ſhape, ſtretching out of the <hi>pelvis.</hi> In the opening ſuch a diſeaſed Body, I ſaw the bladder adhering cloſe to the upper part of the <hi>os pubis,</hi> and that part of the <hi>peritonaeum.</hi> In another there was frequently diſcharged a matter with the Urine not unlike corrupt Seed.</p>
                     <p>One riding a Journey was hurt by the ſtumbling of his Horſe, and became ſo indiſpoſed, that he was brought back to Town. Phyſicians and Chirurgeons were conſulted, and ſuppoſed him bruiſed internally. They let him blood, and treated him accordingly, but without ſucceſs. The day after I was fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and found him labouring with great oppreſſion, ſhortneſs of breath, fainting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I viewed his body naked, and endeavoured to inform my ſelf of his bruiſe, but there was no ſymptom of any. I ſeeing he was not likely to recover, took my leave, and deſired a Servant of the houſe to give me notice of his death. He died that night, and I went the next morning and opened his Body. All the <hi>Viſcera</hi> were ſound, and no blood extravaſated, but within the <hi>pelvis</hi> I ſaw a great quantity of purulent matter, like that which iſſues forth in a <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi> I divided the <hi>os pubis,</hi> and opened the <hi>pelvis,</hi> and ſaw near the Proſtates a bag broken, which I concluded to be one of the <hi>veſiculae ſeminales.</hi> Upon ſearch into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> I found he had been long diſeaſed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of a <hi>Gonorrhoea, viz.</hi> Caruncles and Carnoſity.</p>
                     <p>The Female Sex do alſo extreamly ſuffer upon the ſame account, the corrupt ſeminal matter frequently excoriating the <hi>pudendum;</hi> whence excreſcences of all ſorts do ariſe, and the ſharp matter dropping from the matrix, frets and ulcerates the external parts of the <hi>labies,</hi> &amp;c. An inſtance of this ſort you may ſee in ſome of the following Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vagina uteri</hi> is alſo ſometimes excoriated, and excreſcences frequently grow there of great bigneſs, one whereof I took off very large of the ſhape of a Mulberry.</p>
                     <p>In others I have ſeen the <hi>vagina uteri</hi> much ulcerated, and diſcharging great quantity of fetid matter with pain and inflammation. The <hi>alae</hi> of the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum</hi> of one were gangrened, but I removed that, and cicatrized ſeveral of the Ulcers; but one Ulcer within the <hi>Vagina</hi> corroded into the bladder, and a mortification followed, and put an end to her miſery.</p>
                     <p>Another upon a ſuppreſſion of that corrupt ſeminal matter was ſeiſed with a <hi>dyſuria:</hi> the cauſe not being diſcovered, the kidneys were blamed. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe increaſing to a <hi>ſtranguria,</hi> a ſtone in the bladder was ſuppoſed. I was fetched to make a ſearch, but felt none. The accidents of pain, inflammations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> increaſing, ſhe died. I opened her body, and ſaw the bladder, <hi>vagina uteri, &amp; inteſtinum rectum</hi> all gangrened: The <hi>muſculi lumbares,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>abdomen</hi> looked as if they had been parboyled: The reſt of the <hi>viſcera</hi> were reaſonable ſound.</p>
                     <p>As from a ſuppreſſion of that malign matter, apoſtemations do ariſe between the interior Tunicles of the <hi>vagina uteri,</hi> ſo I have ſometimes met with ſcirrhous Tumours, which I have ſometimes palliated by Antivenereals, when they were thought Cancers. All theſe miſchiefs increaſed to ſuch height through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in them that treated them.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have given you an account of the ſeveral ſymptomes as they ariſe one upon the neck of another, by which you may diſtinguiſh how they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of them is alſo apparent, that they ariſe from a <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
                     <p>The ſigns of Caruncles I have alſo ſhewed you are diſcoverable by a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing candle, they lying in the way give a ſtop to the candle in its motion to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95669:292"/>Bladder. Yet let not that make you over confident that there is no Stone in the Bladder, for it frequently happeneth that there is alſo a Stone therein; therefore you ought to inform your ſelf of the peculiar ſymptoms of that Diſeaſe before you oppoſe it. For ſo alſo from that Stone a dribling of the urine is common, and in caſe of pain the urine cometh forth forked and in a ſmall ſtream. But in Caruncles it cometh forth more forcibly than in thoſe of the Stone, and they make much urine at a time, and are in eaſe after they have uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which doth not happen in the Stone.</p>
                     <p>A Carnoſity hath the ſame ſigns that Caruncles have, but the urine being more ſtraitned by the carnoſity maketh the ſymptoms the more ſevere, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is frequently a pain in the <hi>glans,</hi> and in ſtraining hard to urine there accompanieth it ſometimes a <hi>prolapſus ani,</hi> which are eſpecial ſigns of the Stone in the Bladder. But the preceding <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi> and ſymptoms of the Caruncles will ſufficiently guide you in making the diſtinction between them two. To diſtinguiſh the Abſceſſes and Ulcers <hi>in Ano</hi> attending this Diſeaſe from thoſe which ariſe from the Hemorrhoids, the Treatiſe of <hi>Fiſtulae Ani</hi> will inſtruct you.</p>
                     <p>The extirpation of Caruncles is no eaſie work,<note place="margin">Prognoſtick.</note> and if there be a Carnoſity joined with it, the Cure is much more difficult. And ſo accordingly as there are other ſymptoms complicated with them, ſo much more is the Diſeaſe render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deplorable and difficult to cure.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of this Diſeaſe the ſame method ought to be obſerved in Diet which hath been delivered in the cure of a <hi>Gonorrhoea;</hi>

                     <p>Having thus offered to you Internals, we ſhall now proceed to ſhew you the way of extirpating theſe Caruncles. The methods thereto propoſed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are various: I ſhall reduce them to two, <hi>viz.</hi> the one by medicaments, the other by meer force with wax-candles, probes of Lead, Silver, or Steel to tear and break them in pieces.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the Caruncle is recent, you may by the compreſſion of a well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned candle cruſh it to pieces, and by the uſe of moderate detergent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccant injections dry and heal the part: but if there be an iſſuing of matter, as in virulent <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi>'s, you muſt firſt remove that matter by purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can hope to extirpate the Caruncles. Nay, if the matter ſhould flow much upon the uſe of the Candles, you muſt forbear further proceeding with them, and make evacuation and revulſion of that peccant matter, as hath been aforeſaid, and then proceed again in the work.</p>
                     <p>In order to the ſearch, you may place the Patient ſitting upon the ſide of his bed, chair or ſtool, with his thighs opened, and his heels drawn back, ſo as he do not preſs upon the <hi>perinaeum.</hi> He muſt alſo at the ſame time lean forward with his body. Then make choice of a proportionable candle, and having ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end, and a little bended it, anoint it with oyl (of Lilies if you pleaſe) paſs it gently in, and move it eaſily forward, that by the warmth it gets in the <hi>ductus</hi> it may ply accordingly with it. If you meet with a ſtop, preſs mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; if it will not go by, draw it back, and take the exact diſtance the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle lieth off, and mark it with your nail; then anoint it with Oil, and paſs it again into the <hi>urethra,</hi> and when you come at that ſtop, raiſe the <hi>penis</hi> with the other hand; if it will not paſs over that Caruncle, try another candle made taper at the end: But if you be ſatisfied that it paſſeth beyond the Caruncle, it is a good ſign, pull it out again; and if the parts be heated, you may inject <hi>decoct. hordei,</hi> &amp;c. and prepare your candles for the conſuming the Caruncle. The Medicaments I propoſe thereto are as followeth: ℞ <hi>cort. mali granat. acid. in umbra ſiccat. &amp; pulveriz.</hi>

Whilſt he puts in the Candle he muſt ſtand ſomewhat ſtradling, and bow his Body forward, but as to his poſture he will make choice of that to his own conveniency. The beſt time to begin this work may be at night, the Candle being then likely to ſtay in its place without diſturbance. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when you draw out the Candle inject ſome lenient decoction, and paſs in a white Wax-Candle of a proportionable bigneſs to the other you drew out, to make good the way you have got, and yet to lenifie the heat in the <hi>ductus;</hi> but if it be not diſturbed, go on as you did to waſh the Caruncle.</p>
                     <p>But if after the uſe of Emollients you cannot paſs the Caruncle, you may well conclude it callous. In which caſe you may paſs a <hi>Canula</hi> into the <hi>

After which you may by the common medicated Candles wear away the remainder, and with Injections cicatrize it. But if after the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of one Caruncle you meet with another behind it, and cannot paſs it, nor a <hi>Canula</hi> ſo far as where the Caruncle lyeth, you may then attempt it by the Leaden Probe. Anoint it firſt, paſs it to the Caruncle, then by preſſing upon it break it off. You muſt expect a bleeding, and it is not done without pain, the <hi>

                     <p>After you have torn off the Caruncle, and that the fear of inflammation is over, you may make a ſearch, and if the Caruncle be extirpated proceed in the drying it to a Cicatrix, which may be by a ſolution of <hi>troch. albi Rhaſ.</hi> in any of the forementioned diſtill'd waters, or as I ſaid with the Royal Stiptick.

                     <p>If there be carnoſity with Caruncles, your way is to dilate and ſupple it by Emollients as above ſaid. If a ſuppreſſion of urine happen, a large Clyſter ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly injected up hath frequently forced the Urine out of the Bladder: but if that fail, a Catheter muſt help you, or an inciſion <hi>in Perinaeo</hi> through the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſity. If a flux of virulent matter be accompanying the <hi>Stranguria,</hi> the laſt remedy is Salivation.</p>
                     <p>If by reaſon of the long continuance of the Diſeaſe the <hi>

If the matter raiſeth a tumour externally, and it do ſuppurate, yet it commonly leaves incurable Ulcers. Therefore you ought upon the leaſt ſuppreſſion of this matter to make revulſion by Antivenereals; yea rather than to fail, raiſe a Salivation, and proſecute the Cure as his habit of body and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Diſeaſe requireth. And the while make way with Emollients to dilate the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> or give vent by inciſion in <hi>Perinoae,</hi> timely to diſcharge the matter.</p>
                     <p>The female Sex are not ſubject to ſuch external apoſtemations. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles do not cauſe ſuppreſſion, nor is the <hi>

The <hi>Vagina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>teri</hi> is alſo ſubject to Ulcers, Excoriation, Excreſcences and ſcirrhous Tumours, with great flux of humours, the <hi>Stranguria</hi> and Inflammation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore require your great care timely to reſiſt them by Antivenereals. <hi>Mer. dulcis,</hi> and thoſe milder preparations being apt to lead the humours downwards are not ſo effectual here as the rougher ſort which vomit. How they are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be treated by internals, and each diſturbance removed or alleviated by external Medicaments, you may ſee among the Obſervations following.</p>
                     <p>One of about 30 years of age,<note place="margin">1. Obſervation of a Caruncle.</note> troubled with a weeping and dribling in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing urine, came to me. I ſuſpecting Caruncles made a ſearch, and found two little rubs in my way, and behind the Teſticles in <hi>Perinaeo</hi> met a full ſtop, which the Candle would not paſs; upon which I drew it out. He had been purged ſuſſiciently by other hands. I began the Cure with cmollient Injections as above preſcribed, and fomented and embrocated the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and after a day or two I carried half a dozen of medicated Candles and made another ſearch and took a meaſure of the place where the great Caruncle lay which made the full ſtop, and left him that Candle with others, ſhewing him how to paſs them in, and encouraged him to make uſe of them in my abſence, and to try what progreſs he could make; alſo adviſing him to uſe the Injection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95669:294"/>and after the uſe of the Candle, and to continue the Embrocation and Plaſter as he ſaw cauſe. During which his body was kept ſoluble by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and healing Decoctions; alſo balſamick Pills were preſcribed. After three or four days I returned, and found the Patient had paſſed over the ſtop, but he had a little heated the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> by over-doing. I then left off the uſe of the Oyl in the Injection. He would have injected Milk, but I ſtrictly forbad that, in conſideration of the miſchief I have known it do in curdling in the Bladder. After the heat was calmed, he uſed the Candles with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, keeping the paſſage open he had made. One night when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed I made him a viſit and brought with me ſome medicated Candles, and having firſt flatted the upper end of one of them I paſſed it into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi> and turned that end over the <hi>Glans,</hi> and with a ſoft Linen cloath over it bound it cloſe on. He ſlept with it untill towards morning, then pulled it out, and urined. In the morning I made a ſearch and ſound the paſſage open. I injected ſome of the emollient lotion and paſſed in one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſearching Candles, and bound it on as the former, and adviſed him to keep his Bed, or at leaſt his Chamber that day, and in caſe of urine to pull it out and inject a <hi>collyrium</hi> of <hi>aq. plant.</hi> and <hi>ſyr. de roſ. ſiccis,</hi> and to put in another Candle the ſame night armed as before. By this method the main Caruncle waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the leſſer which lay in the way to that was conſumed by the paſſing and lying on of the ſame Candles. I feeling no more rubs left off the uſe of the Candles, and ſent him an injection of <hi>aq. plantag. rubi, equiſeti,</hi> wherein was diſſolved a few grains of <hi>lap. medicament. Crollii,</hi> by which the reliques of the Excreſcences were dried up, as alſo the weeping, and the Patient remained cured. Thus by ſhewing the Patients how to uſe the Candles, they themſelves have ſometimes proſecuted their Cures at a great diſtance from me with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>One having had many <hi>Gonorrhoea's</hi> and been frequently under Cure of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcles came to me.<note place="margin">2. Obſervation.</note> Upon ſight of the <hi>Penis</hi> I ſaw he had an iſſuing of much matter as in a virulent <hi>Gonorrhoea.</hi> I made a ſearch for my own ſatisfaction, and met with ſeveral excreſcences, and a full ſtop before I reached to the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum.</hi> The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> was tender and did not admit the Candle without pain. I began with the letting him blood, and purged him the next morning with Whey, <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Cremor tartari.</hi> After which I bathed him four or five times in warm water, keeping his body ſoluble the while with Clyſters, or a bole of <hi>caſſia, ol. amygd. dul. ſyr. viol.</hi> and the like. After he had done bathing I gave him 25 grains of <hi>mer. dul.</hi> at night, and a Clyſter the next day, and repeated the <hi>mer. dul.</hi> every other day, and ſyringed him with a lotion of <hi>aq. plantag.</hi> with a ſolution of <hi>troch. alb. Rhaſ.</hi> But afterward obſerving the <hi>mer. dul.</hi> not to anſwer my expectation, it having as I perceived been no novelty to him, I gave him gr. 8. of <hi>turbith min.</hi> which vomited him three or four times, and gave him half a dozen large ſtools, by which I believed the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury he had taken before worked downward. I ordered him a Clyſter of milk <hi>cum vitel. ovor.</hi> that night to quiet his Bowels, and another the next day, and the day after gave him 12 gr. of <hi>turbith miner.</hi> which vomited him four or five times, and purged him twice or thrice. By the repeating of this Medicament tiwce or thrice, intermitting three or four days between, I leſſened that flux of matter very much, but it making his chops ſore I purged it off with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Decoction, and put him into a <hi>decoct. ſarſae, lig. lentis, rad. conſolid biſtort. &amp;c.</hi> and gave him of that Electuary with <hi>terebinth. ſal. prunellae, &amp;c.</hi> alſo Clyſters of <hi>terebinth.</hi> ſometimes at night going to bed. Injections of <hi>lap. medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſi Crollii</hi> were afterward uſed, by which the running ceaſed. I then made a ſearch with a Candle, and having marked the main ſtop I proceeded in the uſe of French Candles which were made Taper faſhion, and paſſed one over the great
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95669:294"/>Caruncle bound in on, and left it lying upon it, and directed the Patient to take it out upon occaſion of urining, and afterward to paſs it again. By the uſe of that there was room made for the application of my own Candles, which I armed with that compoſition of <hi>merc. praecipitat. &amp;c.</hi> and thereby did wear off that Caruncle. Afterwards I met with others, which I alſo extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the ſame way; and with the ſolution of <hi>lap. medicamentoſi Crollii</hi> and the uſe of Leaden Probes, I ſmoothed and cicatrized them.</p>
                     <p>I was ſent for one night to a man that laboured of a ſuppreſſion of Urine, with great pain about the <hi>os pubis.</hi> I intended to have paſſed a Catheter,<note place="margin">3. Obſervation.</note> but ſaw the head of the <hi>Glans</hi> hard as a Cartilage, and the entrance into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> ſo narrow as I could ſcarce get in a ſmall Probe. I was at a loſs how to relieve him. I preſently cauſed a large pint of milk to be warmed for a Clyſter, and ſyringed it up quick, and of a ſudden the urine forced its way out in a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. The Patient ſuppoſed himſelf to have the Stone, but I aſſured him the contrary, his diſeaſe being Caruncles with carnoſity, no better than the Pox in thoſe parts, and more difficult to cure than any of the forementioned ſpecies of it. I let him blood that night and purged him the next day with a decoction of <hi>Caſſia, tamarind. &amp;c.</hi> with an addition of <hi>Manna, ſyr. roſ. Damaſc.</hi> and afterwards bathed him three or four days, and then anointed with the mercurial Unction his Legs, Arms and <hi>Perinaeum, &amp;c.</hi> by which I raiſed a ſalivation. It laſted about thirty days, during which he made urine with more eaſe; yet upon ſearch I found the Caruncles, but the carnoſity in the <hi>Glans, &amp;c.</hi> reſolved. During his ſalivating I caſt emollient Injections into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> daily, and afterwards while he was in his courſe of ſweating and purging I began to work with the Candles, and made way with little difficulty till I came into the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and there I ſpent ſome days in endeavouring to paſs a ſmall taper-candle without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Wherefore I attempted it by the force of a Leaden Probe, and brake the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle off. It bled 3 or 4 ounces, but I ſtopped it by injecting <hi>aq. ſper. ranar.</hi> with a few grains of <hi>lap. medicament. Crollii,</hi> then embrocated the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> and parts about with <hi>ol. roſ. cum aceto,</hi> and applyed an <hi>empl. è bolo</hi> over them. The next morning I found he had not urined much better. I injected again, and paſſed in a Candle, and perceived that Caruncle eradicated, but I met with another behind which I could not paſs, I again uſed Injections and paſſed in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-candle, by which I gradually proceeded, and afterwards by armed ones I freed that paſſage, and his urine came away in a full ſtream. I proſecuted the cure with medicated Candles and drying Injections, and continued the uſe of ſudorifick decoctions and aſtringent Pills till he was cured. Yet ſome while after he came to me again complaining that there was a Caruncle near the end of the Bladder which hindered his paſſing the Candle into the Bladder, ſuch hath been the complaint of others, but that Caruncle was natural.</p>
                     <p>One came to me having had many <hi>Gonorrhoea's,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Obſervation.</note> and in his later years much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in Urine. I made a ſearch, and found he had Caruncles, and one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an inch of the entrance into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> We agreed upon the Method of Cure, and I was to begin my work the next day, but heard not from him till about a year after. It ſeemed he had been that while in other hands, who had propoſed an eaſier method of Cure but ſailed. Yet the urinary paſſage was thereby more enlarged, ſo that the Patient could better admit of the Candles, and was alſo the more obſervant to my Rules; but then again there was a ſlux of matter which required to be removed. To which purpoſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with a doſe of <hi>turbith miner.</hi> and by the repeating of it made revulſion and ſalivated him. During the Salivation I fomented and embrocated the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaeum</hi> and injected emollient Decoctions, and by Candles proſecuted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation, paſſed the leſſer Caruncle, and afterwards preſſing upon the bigger
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95669:295"/>with a proportionable big Candle I brake it, and permitted it to bleed, and then paſſed a medicated Candle over that broken Caruncle, and by the preſſure of it wore that Caruncle off ſmooth. There was another Caruncle that lay behind this in <hi>Perinaeo,</hi> which I alſo made way over by a taper-candle, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the preſſure of my medicated Candles I waſted them. During which he paſſed through a courſe of purging, ſweating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and finiſhed the Cure by the uſe of Aſtringents as well inwardly as outwardly.</p>
                     <p>A Man who had been long diſeaſed with a weeping <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to me for Cure.<note place="margin">5. Obſervation.</note> By making his urine and ſearch I found that he had Caruncles. I proceeded by Injections and Embrocations to make way for my Candles, and cleared my paſſage into the <hi>

But the Patient not keeping his Chamber made my work irkſome to me. Whereupon one morning I took a Candle proportionable to the <hi>ductus,</hi> and having ſmoothed one end I dipt it in Oyl, and paſſed it readily to the Caruncle, and whilſt it was ſtiff I preſſed hard upon the Caruncle to break it, and did ſo; but at that very inſtant the Patient was ſeiſed with a rigour, and in pulling it out the blood followedl. I Injected a ſolution of <hi>pul. bol. Armen.</hi> in <hi>aq. ſperm. ranar.</hi> and ſtopt the bleeding; but after that rigour the Patient burned and lay diſtempered all night, and in the morning I found him in a Fevour, yet he had no conſiderable pain in the urinary paſſage. I applyed Refrigerants externally to the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and let him blood, and conſulted a Phyſician. He was brought very weak by this Fevour, but recovered, (as I thank God I never had one dyed upon this account.) From that time he would make no more uſe of Candles, but put me upon the uſe of Injections, of which I tryed many ſorts; the beſt was a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>lap. medicament. Crollii,</hi> by which he made water better, and to this day enjoys a good health.</p>
                     <p>One about 50 years of age who had laboured long with Caruncles,<note place="margin">6. Obſervation.</note> finding his Urine to come daily much more difficultly away, ſent for me. I made a ſearch and found a rub before I had entred an inch into the <hi>ductus.</hi> I began by purging him with an opening apozeme of <hi>caſſia, tamarind. rad. gran. &amp;c.</hi> and let him blood, then having relaxed the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> by Emollients I proceeded with the Candles, and by degrees made way till I came to a Caruncle near the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles. I endeavoured to paſs that with taper-candles, and after ſome while made way and applyed armed ones for ſome days, and wore that Caruncle down, and paſſed in towards the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> where the paſſage was extremely ſtrait, and a Caruncle ſtopt our going forwards. In preſſing upon it the Patient was immediately ſeiſed with a rigour. I pulled out the Candle whole, and without blood. The next day I found my Patient in bed without pain or Fevour; yet I let him blood, and gave him a Clyſter. The day after I purged him with the aforeſaid Apozeme. The next day I made a ſearch, and paſſing a Wax-Candle into that ſtrait paſſage he began again to fall into a rigour. Whereupon I deſiſted, and contented my ſelf in the making good the way I had gotten by putting in a proportionable thick Leaden Probe (which had been rub'd with Quick-ſilver) ſome days, which Probe had a flat head as broad as a three-pence to retain it from ſlipping in. I repeated the uſe of Emollients and mercurial Emplaſters to the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> and withal made revulſion by a vomit of <hi>turbith mineral.</hi> and by repeating it I raiſed a Salivation, which laſted longer than I intended, but it ſerved my purpoſe ſo well as I afterwards made way over that Caruncle in <hi>Perinaeo</hi> without danger, and by armed Candles waſted it. Then with detergent Injections and medicated Candles ſmoothed and healed the <hi>ductus,</hi> and left him a free and eaſie paſſage for his Urine, and concluded that courſe of Phyſick with purging, ſudorificks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Thoſe on the more external parts were callous.

                     <p>In the year 1652.<note place="margin">10. Obſervation.</note> at my return to <hi>London</hi> from the Battel at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> I ſomewhile aſſiſted that moſt excellent Chirurgeon the deceaſed Mr. <hi>Ed.

                     <p>An Old Fornicator, hoaving been long diſeaſed with a Carnoſity, which had reſiſted all endeavours, and in a manner totally ſuppreſt his Urine, ſent for him; he went, and cauſed the Patient to be taken out of Bed, and placed upon a Table, with his Legs drawn up, as in cutting for the Stone; be cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> near the neck of the Bladder, it was hard as a griſtle. His knife did not readily divide it, but ſo ſoon as he had, the Urine guſhed out, which being diſcharged, he put his finger into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the inciſion upward more to the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> then dreſſed it up with his green Balſom warm, by which in few days it digeſted, and the Patient was relieved: the lips grew alſo daily ſofter, and the wound healed apace, but all this while the Urine had no other paſſage, the common <hi>ductus</hi> being ſo clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by reaſon of the Carnoſity, that we could not make any way into it with our ſmalleſt probes or candles. Upon which conſideration it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep this opening in <hi>perinaeo</hi> for the diſcharge of Urine, and in order thereto it was dreſſed up with a Doſſil, an Emplaſter and Compreſs, which the Patient took off at times to eaſe Nature. But this not ſatisſying him, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complained of his unhappy condition; inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Ed. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> being wearied with the Patient's ſolicitation, took me one morning along with him, where again he placed the Patient as before, and attempted to make a way from the <hi>Apex</hi> into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> but it was in vain. Whereupon he cauſed one of his Servants to hold the one leg, and my ſelf the other while he took up the Teſticles, and put the one into my hand, and the other he placed in the hand of his Servant; then with his knife divided the <hi>Scrotum</hi> in the middle (we holding each Teſticle the while in our hands) and cutting into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> ſlit it the whole length to the inciſion <hi>in perinaeo;</hi> then with a needle and thread ſtitch the skin over the <hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95669:296"/>which they were cured in few days: But the Urine nevertheleſs continued to flow by the opening <hi>in perinaeo.</hi>

                     <p>A lean withered old Man, near ſeventy years of Age,<note place="margin">11. Obſervation</note> having in his younger years had many <hi>Gonorrhoea</hi>'s, complained in his later years of difficulty in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his urine, and that he vioded much matter. He ſent for me, and would needs have his diſeaſe to be the Stone, and that matter to proceed from an ulcer in his bladder. I endeavoured to inform him better, but obſerving him ſo wiſe, I was well enough contented he ſhould report it ſo, and concerned my ſelf no further with him, than by the preſcribing him an emulſion. About a year after, his urine being in a manner ſuppreſt he ſent for me again; I made a ſearch, and found the entrance into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> eaten away below the <hi>frae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> with part of the prepuce, and the paſſage there into the <hi>ductus</hi> difficult to find; and after I got in, it was ſo ſtrait and ſtuft with Caruncles, that I could make no way either by probe or wax-candle. I ordered him preſently a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſuppoſing thereby to force the Urine out; but it would not. I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the cutting into the <hi>ductus</hi> below, but he would not. The retention of the matter in the ſeminals ſoon after raiſed a Tumour beneath the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> which being exceeding painful, he was contented I ſhould make an opening to let his Urine out. I placed him in a clear light, with his legs drawn up, as in the former Obſervation hath been ſaid, and made inciſion into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi> near the neck of the bladder: which having done, and ſatisfied my ſelf by my finger, and diſcharge of his Urine, that I had made opening enough, I dreſſed him up with the Spaniſh Balſom, there being no blood loſt in the work, ſave what came from the skin, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> it ſelf being cartilagineous. From that time I only dreſſed the wound with a doſſil dipt in the ſmae Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and applyed a pledget over it, with an <hi>emplaſt. diachalcith.</hi> and bandage to retain it on. To the ſwelling above I applyed a Cataplaſm <hi>ex ra. &amp; fol. hyoſcyami, cicutae,</hi> &amp;c. by which the Tumour reſolved, the matter indeed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging with the Urine by the opening. There was not much care taken in dreſſing this Ulcer, for in ſeven or eight days it contracted, and being callous could not unite, if the Urine would have permitted it, but it had no other paſſage. The Patient was hereby greatly relieved, and had no other trouble but to Urine this way, which I thought he would have been well pleaſed with, and rejoyced in the having ſuch an eaſie diſcharge: Yet after ſome months he made me many viſits, maundring as if I had done him a diſcourteſie in leaving ſuch an opening. Whereupon to quiet him, I gave him ſome ſearching candles, and wiſhed him to go home, and try if he could find any paſſage from the <hi>Apex</hi> into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra</hi> to the Bladder; if he could, I would readily heal that Ulcer <hi>in perinaeo,</hi> otherwiſe I wiſht him to conſider how he would Urine: upon which he became more ſatisfied. He lived ſome years after, and died of Old Age.</p>
                     <p>One having been long troubled with a difficulty in Urine,<note place="margin">12. Obſervation.</note> was at laſt ſeiſed with a Tumour <hi>in perinaeo</hi> hard and painful. I was fetched, and ſeeing it would tend to ſuppuration, I dreſſed it with a Cataplaſm <hi>ex rad. althae. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior. &amp;c.</hi> and having ſuppurated it, I opened it by inciſion, and diſcharged a quantity ofmatter. In the dreſſing of it daily I obſerved much gleet, which I diſcovered after a while to be Urine mixed with the matter, and upon ſearch found Caruncles in his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra.</hi> I perceiving the cauſe of the abſceſs proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cure with candles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been ſet down in the method of Cure; and having cleared that paſſage, and made a free way for the Urine, I made ſearch into the abſceſs, and laid it open by inciſion according to the length of the <hi>perinaeum,</hi> and from that time haſtened the incarning and agglutination of the Ulcer as well by internals as externals, and in few weeks cicatrized it ſmooth and firm.</p>

Decoctions of <hi>ſarſa,</hi> with Pectorals, Emulſions, Cordial Juleps, Balſamicks, alſo lenient purgatives with <hi>calomel.</hi> were preſcribed, and much pains was taken in the Chirurgery, but he not being capable of the great Remedies our work proved unſucceſsful, and he removed into ſome of the neighbouring Villages to drink Aſſes milk, and to try how he could nouriſh himſelf in the freſh Air, where I think he died.</p>

Which being confeſt, we dreſt the Ulcer, and preſcribled ſome little remedies. A day or two after we met again, made a ſearch with a Candle into the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra,</hi> and diſcovered Caruncles, which was alſo apparent by his piſſing. The Patient was much pained by the ſearching, and deſired that work might be forborn till this Ulcer <hi>in ano</hi> was better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Upon which my friend declined his viſits. The diſcharge of that viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter fretted the parts without, and enlarged the opening into the <hi>rectum inteſtinum,</hi> ſo as upon paſſing my finger <hi>in ano</hi> I felt it, and by a curved Probe, found the <hi>ſinus</hi> tend to the <hi>perinaeum.</hi> Upon which part I applyed a cauſtick, and afterwards made inciſion into the lower part of the <hi>ſinus,</hi> whereby the matter was partly diſcharged. But the had little advantage thereby, his diſeaſe being Venereal required a ſevere courſe of phſick: but he not ſubmitting to it, the matter afterward apoſtemated that buttock, and diſcharged it ſelf through many orifices. He lived ſeventeen years thus and followed his employment abroad.</p>
                     <p>One having been many years afflicted with the reliques of a <hi>Gonorrhoea,</hi> it at length brake its way downward and raiſed an abſceſs under the <hi>pubis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">16. Obſervation.</note> and through want of ſufficient vent corroded the <hi>

He had alſo a continual weeping of a virulent matter by the <hi>penis,</hi> and paſſed his urine in a ſmall ſtream and frequently forked.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95669:297"/>Ulcer with precipitate. But after I had a while purged him with Mercurials I ſcraped off the cruſted precipitate, and dreſſed it up with Pledgets dipt in <hi>tinctura vitrioli,</hi> and applyed a compreſs over them with good bandage, and renewed the dreſſings once in three or four days, during which I gave him 10 grains of <hi>turbith mineral.</hi> by which I made revulſion of that peccant matter. The ſecond day I repeated the <hi>turbith,</hi> and gave him another doſe of the ſame the third day after, and purpoſed to have raiſed a Salivation; but finding the Patient not able to bear any thing of that kind I forbore the further proceeding thereby, and by Clyſters and lenient purgers carried the matter downward. The Ulcer being cicatrized and the <hi>callus</hi> reſolved, I threw off the bandage, and concluded him well thereof. Whilſt I purged him to carry off the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſpit the more, and his mouth grew ſore, which put me upon indulging him the longer, but as his mouth healed I purged him again, and kept him to the drinking a decoction of <hi>ſarſaparilla, &amp;c.</hi> and began to make way with Candles to extirpate the Caruncles; but the fiſtulous Ulcer being cured, he would not believe the extirpating the Caruncles neceſſary.
